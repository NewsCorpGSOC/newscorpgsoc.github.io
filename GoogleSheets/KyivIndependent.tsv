Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 14 over past day	Russian forces launched multiple attacks across Ukraine, killing two civilians and injuring 14, regional authorities reported on Dec. 29. Overnight, Russia launched 10 drones from Crimea and six S-300/S-400 missiles from Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, targeting the Kursk and Sumy oblasts, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. Ukrainian defenses shot down nine drones over Mykolaiv Oblast using anti-aircraft systems, electronic warfare, and mobile fire units. Kharkiv Oblast: There were no reported attacks on the Kharkiv city during the day. One civilian was killed by a drone munition drop in the village of Dvorichna, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Donetsk Oblast: Russian forces attacked the region six times. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed in the village of Kotlyne, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Kherson Oblast: Russian artillery struck Bilozerka, injuring 13 people, including two children, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Mykolaiv Oblast: Debris from downed drones caused fires in three outbuildings and a vacation home in a recreational area. The Chornomorsk community also came under attack, with debris setting fire to an administrative building at an energy facility. Rescuers quickly extinguished the blaze, and a 49-year-old worker was injured, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. Zaporizhzhia Oblast: Russian forces launched 331 attacks on nine localities, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure. No civilian casualties were reported, according to Governor Ivan Fedorov. Sumy Oblast: Russia attacked border areas three times, recording four explosions.

Anti-Western Kavelashvili sworn in as Georgia's president, pro-EU Zourabichvili disputes legitimacy	Georgian anti-Western politician Mikheil Kavelashvili, an ally of the ruling Georgian Dream party, was inaugurated as the country&apos;s sixth president on Dec. 29 in a move seen as illegitimate by the opposition. Georgia&apos;s fifth president, Salome Zourabichvili, said she would vacate the presidential palace but stressed she remains the legitimate head of state, pledging to continue the struggle against the ruling party. Zourabichvili called Kavelashvili&apos;s election a &quot;mockery of democracy&quot; as the former football player was elected as the only candidate on the ballot by the new parliament seen as illegitimate by its opponents. The inauguration ceremony in the parliament building was attended by oligarch and Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili but not by foreign diplomats, who were not invited due to alleged &quot;lack of space.&quot; Pro-EU Zourabichvili called upon the government&apos;s opponents to gather at the presidential palace to join yet another rally against the Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party. Opposition parties said they would continue to recognize Zourabichvili as the legitimate president. The most recent waves of protests have been ongoing in the South Caucasus country since Georgian Dream claimed victory in the October parliamentary elections disputed by the opposition and international observers. The government stepped in with riot police and tear gas against the protesters and said that the country&apos;s EU accession process would be suspended at least until 2028 amid Western criticism. Speaking to citizens gathering at the Orbeliani Palace in Tbilisi, Zourabichvili called the ruling party &quot;locked up, scared, corrupt, illegitimate, unrecognized, subject to sanctions&quot; in an apparent reference to recent U.S. sanctions on Ivanishvili. Zourabichvili said that her loyalty to the Georgian people does not change based on whether she is inside or outside the presidential palace, adding: &quot;I will leave here with you and will be with you. I take with me legitimacy, the flag, your trust.&quot; Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze threatened Zourabichvili ahead of the inauguration by forcibly removing her and placing her in a &quot;correctional facility&quot; if she refused to leave the presidential seat voluntarily. Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, has been accused of undermining the country&apos;s democracy and dragging it into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit while derailing EU accession efforts. The ruling-party-backed foreign agents law, compared to similar repressive legislation in Russia, was adopted in May amid widespread criticism from international partners and mass protests at home.	https://kyivindependent.com/anti-western-kavelashvili-inaugurated-as-georgias-president/	2024-12-29T00:29:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/431540653_801582235120441_189950244604750563_n.jpg
German peacekeeping role in Ukraine hinges on Russia's consent, Merz says	Germany may consider joining a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine only with Russia&apos;s consent, Friedrich Merz, the opposition CDU/CSU alliance&apos;s chancellor candidate, said on Dec. 28, according to Die Zeit. His comments followed reports that the U.K. and France are discussing sending troops to monitor a ceasefire in Ukraine, with similar proposals allegedly included in U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s peace plan. Merz noted that Germany&#x2019;s participation in peacekeeping operations requires a clear mandate under international law, emphasizing that Russia&apos;s agreement is essential. &quot;If a peace agreement is reached and Ukraine needs security guarantees, we can only discuss this if there is a clear mandate under international law. I don&#x2019;t see it at the moment. I would like such a mandate to be given in consensus with Russia, not in conflict,&quot; Merz said. Despite his criticism of Chancellor Olaf Scholz for hesitancy in supporting Ukraine&#x2014;particularly regarding Taurus missiles &#x2014; Merz&#x2019;s stance on deploying troops aligns closely with Scholz&apos;s cautious approach. On Dec. 4, Merz described discussions about German troop deployment to ensure a ceasefire as &quot;irresponsible.&quot; Scholz has ruled out deploying German troops to Ukraine &quot;at this stage,&quot; citing an agreement with Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. Pistorius left the door open for potential future peacekeeping operations, saying, &quot;There are still too many unknowns.&quot; Merz, whose CDU/CSU alliance leads in polls ahead of Germany&#x2019;s Feb. 23 elections, recently visited Kyiv, pledging a more assertive stance on arming Ukraine. His comments highlight ongoing debates within Germany about its role in post-war security guarantees for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-peacekeeping-role-in-ukraine-hinges-on-russias-consent-merz-says/	2024-12-28T23:57:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187620278--1-.jpg
Azerbaijan to change rules for temporary stay of Russian citizens	Azerbaijan will change the rules for the temporary stay of Russian citizens on its territory in the coming days after Russia announced stricter rules for the stay of foreigners, the Azerbaijan State News Agency reported on Dec. 28. &quot;As in all foreign policy issues... the Azerbaijani side will proceed in accordance with the principles of parity and reciprocity,&quot; Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ayhan Hajizade told the media when asked about Russia&apos;s new regulations. Russia previously announced that, as of Jan. 1, 2025, the temporary stay of foreign citizens without visas will be limited to 90 days within a calendar year instead of 90 days within 180 days. Foreigners will also be obliged to register at their destination within seven working days of crossing into Russia. Baku is considering these new rules from the perspective of the rights of Azerbaijani citizens, Hajizade said without revealing details of Azerbaijan&apos;s planned changes. Azerbaijan is one of the countries whose citizens can enter Russia for a limited time period without a visa. The two countries&apos; close economic and political ties are being tested after an Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashed on Dec. 25 in Kazakhstan after allegedly coming under fire from Russian air defenses in Chechnya. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to apologize for the crash that killed 38 people without explicitly admitting responsibility.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijan-to-change-rules-for-temporary-stay-of-russian-citizens/	2024-12-28T23:34:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1089909744--1-.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 785,930 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 785,930 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 29. This number includes 1,730 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,656 tanks, 19,981 armored fighting vehicles, 32,410 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,450 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,032 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 21,038 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-785-930-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-28T23:13:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1770835562.jpg
US teacher in Russian prison declared wrongfully detained, Associated Press reports	The U.S. government has officially classified Marc Fogel, an American schoolteacher jailed in Russia on drug charges, as wrongfully detained, the State Department announced on Dec. 27. Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, was arrested in August 2021 at a Russian airport for possessing marijuana, which his family and supporters say was prescribed for medical use. He is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence. Fogel&apos;s omission from a major prisoner exchange in August, which secured the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and corporate security executive Paul Whelan, led his family to push for stronger U.S. government efforts. His advocates urged the Biden administration to classify him as wrongfully detained, a move that typically increases diplomatic efforts to secure a detainee&#x2019;s release. The State Department confirmed that Fogel received the designation, explaining that the decision followed a review of factors, including whether his detention serves to influence U.S. policy or extract concessions from the government. &quot;The United States has been working to secure Marc Fogel&#x2019;s release for some time. We have long called for his humanitarian release and tried to include him in the Aug. 1 deal, but were unable to. The Secretary determined Marc was wrongfully detained in October,&quot; the department said, according to the Associated Press. The reason for the State Department&apos;s delay in announcing the designation remains unclear. With the designation, Fogel&#x2019;s case will now fall under the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, which focuses on negotiating the release of Americans wrongfully detained abroad. In a statement, Fogel&#x2019;s wife, Jane, and his sons, Ethan and Sam, reportedly expressed gratitude for the designation. &quot;The State Department has finally acknowledged what we have known all along &#x2014; that our husband and father, Marc Fogel, has and continues to be wrongfully detained,&quot; they said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-teacher-in-russian-prison-declared-wrongfully-detained-associated-press-reports/	2024-12-28T20:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1985748928.jpg
Telegram blocks Russian state-owned media channels in several EU countries	A number of major Russian news outlets had their Telegram channels blocked across several European Union countries on Dec. 28. Users attempting to access these channels now see a notice saying that the content has been restricted and is no longer available. Restrictions apply to several Russian state-run or controlled media outlets, including RIA Novosti, Izvestia, Rossiya 1, Channel One, NTV, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Russia has waged a systematic international campaign of media manipulation and disinformation to justify its aggression against Ukraine and destabilize neighboring countries and the EU. These efforts target Ukraine and its citizens, as well as European political parties, civil society, and democratic institutions, with a focus on election interference and vulnerable groups. While it is not yet confirmed if the measures are enforced across the entire EU, the channels have reportedly been blocked in Poland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, and &#xA0;Czechia. The European Union has previously imposed measures targeting Russian media amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. In May, outlets like Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Izvestia, and RIA Novosti were banned from broadcasting within the bloc. At the time, the EU Council said that these outlets played a crucial role in the war. &quot;These media outlets are under the permanent direct or indirect control of the leadership of the Russian Federation,&quot; read the statement. &quot;(They) have been essential and instrumental in bringing forward and supporting Russia&#x2019;s war of aggression against Ukraine and for the destabilization of its neighboring countries.&quot; Neither Telegram nor EU officials have issued statements about the latest restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/telegram-blocks-russian-state-owned-media-channels-in-eu/	2024-12-28T20:02:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1316489069.jpg
German FM warns of Russian 'shadow fleet' amid undersea cable incidents, calls for sanctions	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has raised concerns about Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; following recent damage to undersea cables across Europe. &quot;Almost every month, ships are currently damaging important undersea cables in the Baltic Sea,&quot; Baerbock told Germany&#x2019;s Funke media group on Dec. 28. She described suspicious activities by ship crews, including dropping anchors and dragging them along the seabed for kilometers without explanation. &quot;Ship crews lower anchors into the water, drag them for kilometers across the seabed for no apparent reason, and then lose them when they pull them up,&quot; she said. Baerbock expressed doubt that the string of incidents over recent months could be coincidental. &quot;This is an urgent wake-up call for all of us. In a digitalized world, undersea cables are the communication arteries that hold our world together,&quot; she stressed, urging stronger sanctions against Russia and increased investment in national security. Earlier this week, Finland reported damage to the Estlink 2 undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia. Finnish authorities suspect sabotage and detained the oil tanker Eagle S, flagged under the Cook Islands. The European Union has linked the vessel to Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The shadow fleet refers to a network of ships allegedly used by Russia to bypass sanctions, such as those restricting oil sales. &quot;It is used by Russia to finance its illegal war of aggression in Ukraine,&quot; Baerbock explained. As of mid-December, over 50 ships from this fleet have faced EU sanctions. In a related event last month, two fiber-optic cables were severed in the Baltic Sea. Swedish investigators boarded a Chinese vessel as part of their probe into possible sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-fm-warns-of-russian-shadow-fleet-amid-undersea-cable-incidents-calls-for-sanctions/	2024-12-28T17:43:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167101990.jpg
Oil spill in Black Sea sparks environmental emergency near Crimea	Russia has raised concerns over a major oil spill in the Black Sea after two tankers collided during a storm near occupied Crimea. The incident, which took place on Dec. 15 in the Kerch Strait, led to one tanker sinking and another running aground. Russia has declared a federal state of emergency on Dec. 26. Authorities estimate the tankers were carrying 9,200 tons of fuel oil, of which approximately 40% potentially leaked into the sea. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the crisis as &quot;truly critical&quot; and acknowledged the challenges in assessing the full scope of environmental damage. &quot;It is unfortunately impossible to calculate for the moment the extent of the environmental damage but specialists are working regularly on it,&quot; Peskov reportedly said, according to Russian media. President Vladimir Putin, earlier this month, referred to the spill as an &quot;ecological disaster.&quot; Thousands of volunteers have joined the clean-up effort, though some Russian scientists have criticized the response as inadequate. Russia&#x2019;s transport ministry announced on Dec. 28 that all affected areas had been cleaned, and no further pollution had been detected. However, Russian Emergency Situations Minister Aleksandr Kurenkov cautioned that the risk of additional leaks persists. In October, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers poses significant environmental risks, as these vessels increase the danger of oil spills.	https://kyivindependent.com/oil-spill-in-black-sea-sparks-environmental-emergency-near-crimea/	2024-12-28T15:52:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1556040259.jpg
Ukrainian drones made up over 96% of UAVs military used in 2024, defense minister says	Ukrainian drones accounted for over 96% of all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used by the military in 2024, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Dec. 28. Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production over the past year. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. The drone industry &quot;reached unprecedented production volumes&quot; in 2024, Umerov said in a Facebook post. Domestically produced drones accounted for 96.2% of all UAVs used by Ukrainian forces this year. Ukraine manufactured over 1.5 million first-person-view (FPV) drones in 2024, Umerov said. Ukrainian enterprises also produced reconnaissance drones, kamikaze aircraft, copter-bombers, and long-range drones, he added. &quot;Such figures indicate a new level of efficiency in the interaction between the state and Ukrainian UAV manufacturers,&quot; Umerov said. President Volodoymyr Zelensky said in December 2023 that Ukraine aimed to produce one million drones in the coming year. In April 2024, Kyiv launched the Brave1 government initiative to invest in defense tech innovations. Ukraine in recent months has championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-made-up-over-96-of-uavs-military-used-in-2024-defense-minister-says/	2024-12-28T13:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1701277083.jpg
Pro-Russian hackers launch cyberattack against Italy's Foreign Ministry, Milan airports	Hackers targeted the websites of the Italian Foreign Ministry and two airports in Milan on Dec. 28, Italy&apos;s cybersecurity agency (ACN) announced. The pro-Russian hacker group NoName057(16) claimed responsibility for the attacks on their Telegram channel. Starting from 8 a.m. local time on Dec. 28, denial of service (DDoS) attacks disrupted the foreign ministry website and the sites of the Milan-Malpensa and Milan-Linate airports, ACN reported. &#xA0;The websites had to shut down temporarily amid the attacks. The disruptions did not affect any flights, the agency said. The cyberattacks against the airports &quot;affected only the sites available to users, not the systems that regulate the flow of flights or even the apps or websites of the individual flight companies,&quot; according to ACN. DDoS attacks direct excessive amounts of traffic at a website in order to overload its servers, often causing disruptions to service. &quot;Russophobes get a well-deserved cyber response,&quot; the hacker group NoName057(16) said in a Telegram post claiming responsibility for the attacks. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims. Pro-Russian hackers have attacked multiple targets throughout Europe since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ACN said. Thse groups aim to &quot;challenge &#xA0;Western countries&apos; support for Ukraine.&quot; Italy on Dec. 24 approved a decree extending military support to Ukraine through 2025. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-hackers-launch-cyberattack-against-italys-foreign-ministry-milan-airports/	2024-12-28T13:08:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1232039648.jpg
Putin names Ukraine main source of 'extremism' in new decree	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 28 signed a decree approving the updated &quot;Strategy for Combating Extremism in the Russian Federation,&quot; according to the country&apos;s official web portal. The new decree names Ukraine among the &quot;main sources of extremism&quot; and enshrines the concept of &quot;Russophobia&quot; for the first time. Russia&apos;s previous anti-extremism strategy, approved by Putin in 2020, did not include the term or single out Ukraine as a threat. The latest version of the document warns of &quot;serious threats&quot; from Ukraine and repeats Russian propaganda claims about the rise of neo-Nazi activity among Ukrainians. It alleges that radical armed groups receive support from &quot;external forces that encourage the commission of criminal acts on the territory of Russia.&quot; The document also outlines a definition of &quot;Russophobia,&quot; which it describes as &quot;an unfriendly, biased, hostile attitude towards Russian citizens, the Russian language and culture, expressed, among other things, in aggressive sentiments and actions on the part of individual representatives and political forces, as well as discriminatory actions on the part of the authorities of states unfriendly to Russia.&quot; Russia has used claims of &quot;extremism&quot; to crack down on a wide range of organizations, including news outlets, social media platforms, and what it calls &quot;the international LGBT social movement.&quot; Russia&apos;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced on Dec. 13 that it had blocked access to the Viber messaging app due to alleged violations of regulations combating terrorism and extremism. The Kremlin is also considering blocking WhatsApp, an app owned by Meta, a company labeled as an &quot;extremist organization&quot; in Russia. The Russian government designated a record 65 organizations as &quot;undesirable&quot; in 2024, exposing members and employees to criminal prosecution. Putin has intensified state repressions of dissent since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, arresting thousands of citizens accused of hate crimes and supporting &quot;extremist&quot; groups.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-names-ukraine-main-source-of-extremism-in-new-decree/	2024-12-28T12:13:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185260447.jpg
Ukraine receives 1st shipment of US LNG	Ukraine on Dec. 27 received its first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Dec. 28. The shipment reached Ukraine via an LNG terminal in Greece. &quot;This is not just a cargo &#x2014; it is a strategic step,&quot; Yermak said. &quot;Despite Russia&apos;s attempts to destroy our energy system during the war, we have won another victory on the energy front.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK, signed a deal on LNG supplies with the U.S. firm Venture Global in June. The agreement marked the first time Ukraine purchased LNG from the U.S. DTEK accepted the first shipment, which contained approximately 100mn cubic meters worth of natural gas, at the Greek port on Dec. 27. The LNG will be re-gasified and exchanged throughout EU and Ukrainian gas networks. The company said it expects to receive similar cargoes in the future. &quot;The arrival of this LNG cargo is a clear signal of DTEK&apos;s determination to play its part in strengthening Ukraine and Europe&apos;s energy security,&quot; DTEK CEO Maksym Timchenko said. The arrival of the first U.S. LNG shipment comes just days before a deal to transit Russian gas to EU countries via Ukraine is set to expire. The EU imposed its first major restrictions on Russian gas, including LNG, in its 14th sanctions package in June. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has suggested replacing Russian LNG supplies with exports from the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1st-shipment-of-us-lng/	2024-12-28T11:16:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1240455902.jpg
Russian shelling in Kherson Oblast injures 8, including 2 teens	Russia attacked the village of Bilozerka in Kherson Oblast with artillery on Dec. 28, injuring eight people, including two teenagers, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. A 16-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl sustained brain injuries and have been hospitalized, Prokudin said. The attack also wounded three men, aged 52, 51, and 21, and three women. Two of the women, aged 43 and 62, sustained brain injuries and contusions, Prokudin said. A third woman received shrapnel wounds to her arms. The victims have reportedly been hospitalized. Kherson and other regional settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River are subjected to daily Russian attacks as Russian troops remain in control across the river&apos;s east bank. Shelling in Bilozerka on Nov. 3 wounded a paramedic and an ambulance driver. Attacks in Kherson Oblast have reportedly increased in recent days, as Russian troops attempt to gain a foothold in the region. Ukraine&apos;s military said on Dec. 27 that it was repelling Russia&apos;s repeated attempts to land on an island in the Dnipro River delta. Ukraine has been anticipating a large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast as Russia pushes into the south.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shelling-in-kherson-oblast-injures-8-including-2-teens/	2024-12-28T10:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1822097784.jpg
Zelensky teases multiple 'important personnel decisions' coming soon	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 28 that his team is &quot;preparing several important personnel decisions&quot; that will be &quot;announced soon.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments followed meetings with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;We are preparing several important personnel decisions,&quot; Zelensky said via his official Telegram channel the evening of Dec. 28. &quot;The decrees will be announced soon.&quot; Zelensky did not provide any further details on what departments or officials would be affected by the new decisions. Earlier this year, Zelensky launched a major government reshuffle, replacing key ministers and appointing a number of new advisors and deputies. In February 2024, Zelensky also replaced Ukraine&apos;s top military leadership, dismissing former Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi and appointing Oleksandr Syrskyi in his place. Ukrainian media outlets reported in fall 2024 that Zelensky was considering dismissing Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Military Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov. The president has denied those reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-teases-multiple-important-personnel-decisions-coming-soon/	2024-12-28T09:57:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Russia officially halts gas supplies to Moldova's Transnistria	The Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom announced on Dec. 28 that it is ending gas supplies to the Russian-occupied region of Transnistria in Moldova, effective Jan. 1, 2025. While a deal to allow Russian gas to flow to Moldova and other European countries via Ukraine expires at the end of the year, Gazprom said the decision was related to Moldova&apos;s outstanding debt, not problems with transit. The Moldovogaz energy company &quot;regularly fails to fulfill its payment obligations,&quot; Gazprom claimed on Dec. 28. As a result, Gazprom is suspending natural gas supplies to Moldova. Transnistria is heavily dependent on Russian gas. Since 2022, the roughly 2 billion cubic meters of Gazprom gas flowing to Moldova per year have been used only by the Transnistria region, while the rest of the country has switched to European supplies. The looming expiration of the Ukraine gas transit agreement led the Moldovan government to declare a 60-day state of emergency beginning Dec. 16, due to fears of a &quot;humanitarian crisis&quot; in Transnistria. Alternative transit routes are available for Moldova, however. Russian gas could reach the country via the TurkStream pipeline, flowing to Turkey and then through Bulgaria and Romania to Moldova. Gazprom has rejected this option. The company announced it was limiting gas supplies to Moldova to &quot;0 cubic meters per day,&quot; citing breach of contract rather than transit issues. Transnistria, a narrow territory at Moldova&apos;s eastern border with Ukraine, has been occupied by Russia since the early 1990s. Under the government of President Maia Sandu, the rest of Moldova has taken a pro-Western turn, launching EU accession talks in June and expelling dozens of suspected Russian spies. Chisinau has repeatedly accused Moscow of hybrid campaigns against the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-officially-halts-gas-supplies-to-moldovas-transnistria/	2024-12-28T09:24:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1787208927.jpg
Greece to deliver 24 Sea Sparrow missiles to Ukraine, media reports	Greece will provide Ukraine with 24 Sea Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles to defend against ongoing Russian aerial attacks, the Greek news outlet Kathimerini reported on Dec. 28. Sea Sparrows are U.S.-made short-range missiles that can be launched from the sea or ground to intercept cruise missiles or aircraft. Ukraine received its first batch of Sea Sparrows from the U.S. in January 2023. Greece will send Ukraine Sea Sparrows from its naval and air force stockpiles that have been deemed unnecessary for the country&apos;s defense operations, Kathimerini reported. The missiles have reportedly been in use for 40 years. Athens has previously refused Kyiv&apos;s requests for certain air defense systems. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in April 2024 that he would not send Ukraine either Patriots or S-300 missile systems, due to Greece&apos;s own defense needs.

How climate change threatens Christmas traditions in Ukrainian Hutsul region	IVANO-FRANKIVSK OBLAST &#x2014; Father Vasyl Diychuk, 41, shows the spot near the river where his village used to build an ice town on Epiphany, celebrated in January. A line of parked cars would stretch for several kilometers &#x2014; people from all over Ukraine and abroad came to Sokolivka to see the chapels, wells, and crosses, all made of ice. For the last three years, the village hasn&apos;t built its famous ice town &#x2014; the winters are so warm that there is nowhere to get ice. This winter, the chances for proper ice are also low. Snow and frost on winter holidays now come as a surprise to Ukrainians. Due to climate change, winters in Ukraine can feel like a very extended November. Instead of snowing, it&apos;s raining, and instead of ice, it&apos;s mud. In western Ukraine&#x2019;s Carpathian Mountains, the land of Hutsuls, where unique Christmas customs require cold weather, warm winters are a big change. The Hutsul region, in the mountainous southwestern part of Ukraine, is one of the country&#x2019;s most ethnographically vivid regions. Since it&#x2019;s difficult to get to, it has always been challenging for whatever state controlled the region to truly establish its rule in the area. New technologies have always reached it late. The Carpathians became part of the Soviet Union only after World War II, and even then, Ukrainian rebels continued to resist the Soviet regime for a decade, hiding in the mountains. Local traditions are also closely linked to Christianity, so the Hutsuls did not tolerate the atheistic Soviet government. &#x2018;In Soviet times, we used to carol secretly. If the authorities found out that you went carolling, you could be laid off&#x2019;, Ivan Zelenchuk, 70, a physicist and local historian from Kryvorivnia in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, says. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, traditions flourished again.

(Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)The most famous Hutsul tradition is koliada. Similar to the Western carol singing, it&#x2019;s a centuries-old custom when a group of singers goes to each home in their village, singing Christmas carols, greeting the birth of Jesus. The carolers sing briefly outside the house and then, if the family invites them for a festive dinner, they go inside and continue there. Ivan Zelenchuk recalls that when he was a child, koliada would always be accompanied by deep snow and severe frost. The weather of 30 degrees below zero Celsius (22 below zero Fahrenheit) was normal on Christmas. It was easy for carolers to lose their voices or catch a cold. &#x201C;It was so cold that sparrows would fall in flight,&#x201D; Zelenchuk recalls. The children also had a favorite winter pastime: throwing a cup of water into the air and watching it freeze before it reaches the ground. Rostyslav Havryliuk, a 19-year-old caroler from Kryvorivnya, shows his grandfather&apos;s festive vest (kuzhukh), which he wore to go carolling this year. It has a thick wool lining, so it is always warm in the frost. He says that nowadays tailors make vests much thinner, because usually there are no more strong frosts. For him, those severe winters are no more than a legend told by older people. More and more often, carolers go without sardaks, the Hutsul outerwear. Once, even carolers went barefoot because it was 10 degrees Celsius outside. Vasyl Tupyliuk, 70, a local historian from Krasnyk, another village in the Hutsul region, says that without snow and frost, the mood on Christmas isn&#x2019;t the same. When the snow falls, locals say that now it&#x2019;s a &#x201C;real Christmas.&#x201D; Carolers, dressed in traditional Hutsul clothes, celebrate Christmas in Kryvorivnya village, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 25, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)People gather for Christmas service in the church in Kryvorivnya village, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 25, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;If there&#x2019;s frost of 15 degrees below zero Celsius and snow up to the ankles, then the snow would hiss and the hatchets (part of a Hutsul costume) would glisten in the sun, and the carollers would rejoice,&#x201D; he says. When it rains on Christmas Day, Tupyliuk says, it&apos;s even easier to get sick than in cold weather, and traditional festive clothes, made from natural fibres and meant to be worn in subzero temperatures, get wet easily and could be damaged. For the last two years, Christmas in the Carpathians has been accompanied by rain, so carolers had to run from house to house. Add the local landscape to the mix: In Hutsul villages, most houses &#xA0;are on the slopes &#x2014; and a rainy Christmas means that carolers have to walk uphill in the mud. In recent years, koliada has begun to attract tourists to the area. Every year, thousands of people come to Kryvorivnia to watch the ritual. On Dec. 25, 2022, the first Christmas since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, a record 5,000 people gathered near the church in Kryvorivnia where the caroling begins. At that time, the local community was one of the first in Ukraine to switch to the Gregorian calendar and celebrate Christmas on Dec. 25, not Jan. 7, as it used to be in Ukraine for over 100 years. The rest of the Ukrainian Orthodox churches switched next year, in 2023. The rainy weather also makes tourists less likely to come, according to Ivan Rybaruk, a priest from Kryvorivnia. Viktor and Alina, a couple from Ivano-Frankivsk, came to Kryvorivnia for koliada this year because they knew it was snowing in the Carpathians. They say that if the weather had been rainy, they would have stayed home. &#x2018;Snow in the Carpathians is extremely important to us in winter. Without it, the holiday spirit fades&#x2019;, Viktor says. The change of weather is also impacting a key Christian tradition in the area. Hutsuls carve ice crosses on Epiphany, the day of Jesus&apos; baptism, celebrated now on Jan. 6. Every year on this day, a cross carved out of ice is placed in the spot where the priest blesses the water. First, a block of ice is cut out, then carefully placed on a sledge and taken to the place where the priest will bless the water. Once there, the block is hewn into a cross. Ivan Dzhelema, 58, a craftsman from Kryvorivnia who organizes the carving of the cross for Epiphany every year, has a pond near his house where he usually sources the ice. The pond is located right under a mountain, and is almost always in the shade. Still, for the pond to freeze well, the frost must last for at least a week. There are potholes in the ice &#x2014; the man goes to the pond to measure the thickness of the ice. On Christmas Eve, the ice in the pond was 12 centimetres thick. That should work: Anything more than 10 centimeters is fit for cross-making. But there&#x2019;s no guarantee the ice will hold until Epiphany. Carolers in traditional Hutsul clothes perform the Christmas custom of koliada in Kryvorivnya village in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 25, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)The custom of carving crosses out of ice has a century-long continuity &#x2014; Dzhelema&#x2019;s father and grandfathers used to organize the cross carving for centuries. Over 30 years ago, the new tradition of ice towns was born in the local village of Sokolivka. In 1990, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, several men from Sokolivka gathered on the Rybnitsa River and carved not one, but three crosses, and the year after that &#x2014; three crosses and an altar table for them. Then it grew. Villagers liked the ice figures, so Sokolivka started making whole ice stories on Christian topics. Tourists started coming to Sokolivka to see the ice fairy tale, as they came to Kryvorivnia for koliada. If it was cold all winter, the ice town could last until March. Some neighboring villages were inspired by the Sokolivka example. In 2011, the village of Spas, on the eastern edge of the Hutsul region, launched its own ice sculpture festival on Epiphany, but had to stop in a few years &#x2014; the winters got warmer, and there wasn&#x2019;t enough ice. The organizer of the festival in Spas, Mykhailo Stovpiuk, 58, regrets that the village had to stop the festival, saying that in the 2010s it had huge success among tourists. With each passing decade, the winters became warmer and carvers had to get more creative. When the tradition started, Sokolivka&#x2019;s carvers were taking the ice from the local river, Rybnytsia. But it has halved in size since the 1990s, and began to freeze only mildly, so carvers started sourcing ice from ponds. Now even that doesn&#x2019;t always help. In the 2020s, winters became so warm that sometimes there is no ice at all. The temperature can stay at 5 degrees Celsius. In 2021, only one ice cross was made in Sokolivka, so carvers had to use birch for other decorations. The same happened in the next two winters. Another local village, Krasnyk, managed to make the traditional ice cross only once in the past 10 years, and had to switch to wood. Last year&apos;s wooden crosses still stand on the river banks both in Sokolivka and Kryvorivnia. That&#x2019;s also a manifestation of the changing weather. Dzhelema says that every year, in the spring, when the mountain rivers get overflown from the melting ice and snow, the stream would wash away the crosses, be they made from ice or wood. But in 2024, for the first time in Dzhelema&#x2019;s memory, there was no flood, and the cross remained standing. He blames global warming and fears what will become of the Hutsul winter traditions.

Every year, Dzhelema organizes the carving of ice crosses for Epiphany, an important local tradition. It&apos;s getting harder for him to source the ice. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)Three wooden crosses on the bank of the river in Sokolivka in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine on Dec. 23, 2024. (Vitalii Poberezhnyi / The Kyiv Independent)Another thing is gone for locals: ice hockey. Dzhelema says that as a child, he would play ice hockey on the river. Elder Hutsuls say that in the 1960s, the local Cheremosh River used to freeze so well that one could drive a car between villages as if it were a road. Today, it sounds like fiction to Hutsul children. However, Hutsul priests are not afraid of the new climate. Father Ivan Rybaruk from Kryvorivnia says that climate change affects what the holiday looks like, but does not change its spirit. &#x201C;I was also surprised to see Santa Claus on the beach in Australia, but that&apos;s how people live,&#x201D; says Rybaruk. Father Vasyl from Sokolivka also says that when it comes to Christmas, people tend to pay more attention to the material than to the spiritual, but it should be the other way round. Many locals simply don&apos;t pay attention to the weather change because the Russian-Ukrainian war is a much more pressing issue for them. In Kryvorivnia alone, 13 men who used to be carolers were killed or went missing on the front. Many can&#x2019;t join the koliada tradition because they serve in the army. It has become a challenge to gather caroling groups. The war itself is accelerating climate change. The fighting and the intensified work of the defense industries increase carbon emissions. &#x201C;In the first two years of the full-scale war, additional emissions (in Ukraine) amounted to 175 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, which is more than the annual emissions of the Netherlands,&#x201D; says Bohdan Kuchenko, an ecologist from Ecodiya, a Ukrainian environmental NGO. The mix of war and climate shift is forcing the Hutsul traditions to change. The Hutsul carol tradition has pagan roots. The custom has survived the merger with Christianity, two world wars, and 45 years of Soviet repression. But mud and rain are testing the Hutsul traditions like never before.	https://kyivindependent.com/how-climate-change-influences-christmas/	2024-12-28T08:43:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/climate-crisis-15.jpg
Azerbaijan Airlines crash highlights Russia's failure to close airspace amid war	The Dec. 25 Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash, likely caused by Russian air defense, shines light on a glaring issue the Kremlin has long swept under the rug. By unleashing its war against Ukraine, Russia has made its airspace a dangerous place. While Ukraine banned civilian flights over its territory hours before the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Russia has limited itself to banning civilian flights over regions bordering Ukraine, as well as some regions not far from the Ukrainian border. Flights over the rest of Russian territory, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, are still allowed despite regular Ukrainian drone attacks deep into Russia. Airports in cities far from the Ukrainian border have faced only temporary restrictions. &quot;In my view, it&apos;s completely irresponsible that Russia&apos;s airspace is still open and that airlines continue to fly into them as part of routine flights,&quot; Fabian Hoffman, a defense policy expert at the Oslo Nuclear Project, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Russia&apos;s airspace is an active war zone, similar to Ukraine&apos;s airspace. Any civilian flights should cease immediately.&quot; The Azerbaijan Airlines plane, which was carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic, crashed on Dec. 25 near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people died as a result of the crash. The crash was caused by a Russian surface-to-air missile, Reuters, Euronews and the Azeri media outlets Caliber.az and AnewZ reported, citing Azerbaijan&apos;s government sources. The reported use of air defense systems aligns with multiple media reports of air defense working in the region on the morning of Dec. 25. Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized for the crash to his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on Dec. 28. Putin confirmed that the plane had tried to land in Grozny but the city was being attacked by Ukrainian drones, and Russian air defense was shooting them down.

(Mikhail Tereshchenko/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Meanwhile, Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case into alleged violations of air safety rules. Azerbaijan Airlines said on Dec. 27 that the preliminary results of an Azeri investigation showed that the plane had suffered &quot;physical and technical external interference.&quot; Aliyev repeated this version in his Dec. 28 conversation with Putin. According to Azerbaijani government sources, the missile was fired from a Russian Pantsir-S air defense system. Russian airports reportedly denied the plane permission for an emergency landing, forcing the pilots to divert toward Aktau in Kazakhstan, located over 500 kilometers east on the opposite coast of the Caspian Sea. It is currently unknown why the plane was denied the right to land and diverted to an airport located hundreds of kilometers east. Some allege that Russian traffic control deliberately diverted the plane toward the sea, where a safe landing would be an extremely difficult task. Russia&#x2019;s state aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, said the plane was diverted to Aktau after a collision with a flock of birds. Following the accident, Azerbaijan Airlines, Kazakhstan&apos;s Qazaq Air, and Israel&apos;s El Al suspended their flights to Russia. If confirmed, it would not be the first time Russia downed a passenger plane during its war against Ukraine. On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by Russian forces in Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, with all 298 people on board being killed.

(Bulent Kilic / AFP via Getty Images)Russian-controlled forces first celebrated the downing, yet later backtracked and deleted their statements when it was revealed that the plane was civilian. Russia continued to blame Ukraine, spreading fake narratives about Ukraine&apos;s air defense and the country&apos;s fighter jets being responsible for the downing. In one instance, Russian propaganda introduced a &quot;Spanish air traffic controller Carlos,&quot; who was described by Russian propaganda as seeing from &quot;Kyiv&apos;s control tower&quot; that the plane was downed by Ukrainian jets. A Dutch court has established that the plane was downed by a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile. Two Russians and one Ukrainian proxy working for Russia were convicted for the murder in absentia in 2022. The plane crash highlights a long-running problem. &quot;The airspace is now contested; that is, the Russian air defense system is shooting at Ukrainian missiles and drones flying across large parts of western Russia,&quot; Peter Layton, an aviation expert at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This situation will worsen and become even more confusing as Ukraine steps up the scale of the attacks and the variety of the missiles it is using. The result is a more dangerous airspace for civilian aircraft to operate in.&quot; Layton added that Russia is also &quot;jamming global positioning (GPS) systems used by civil airliners for navigation.&quot; &quot;This jamming is to thwart attacking Ukrainian missiles and drones,&quot; he said. &quot;There are manual procedures to work around this deliberate interference, but it adds to the difficulties and dangers of civilian aircraft operating in Russian airspace.&quot; Michael Harwood, another air power expert at the Royal United Services Institute, agreed, saying that &quot;for as long as the sovereign nation of Ukraine is attacked and occupied by forces directed by the Kremlin, nothing is safe in Russia.&quot; Erik Stijnman, a military expert at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations (Clingendael), also argued that &quot;without any doubt, an ever more contested airspace through the use of unmanned aerial systems and missiles will lead to more accidents.&quot; &quot;The chance of human error will increase when air defenders are asked in a time-constrained environment to decide on target selection and firing approval,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;What does not help is that tactics designed to saturate the air defense systems intend to confuse systems and operators in order to influence the air defenders&apos; friend or foe identification process. More saturation means more decisions. More decisions means more mistakes.&quot; Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, argued that &quot;the question is what Russia will be able to do to improve its defenses and whether Ukraine will be able to keep up sufficient levels of production and innovation to stay ahead of Russia.&quot; According to international aviation customs, it&apos;s up to Russia to issue a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) and close its own airspace. Despite the danger posed by drone attacks and air defense, Russia has been reluctant to close its airspace, except for regions bordering Ukraine. Wolff and Hoffman said that regular Ukrainian drone attacks would be valid reasons for closing Russia&apos;s airspace. Hoffman added, however, that &quot;the Russian regime, of course, has a great incentive to keep its airspace relatively open in order to signal a sense of normalcy and control to the Russian public and international audiences.&quot; Stijnman also said that &quot;these developments increase the chance that restrictions may be deemed necessary in Russia.&quot; &quot;Ultimately, it is a decision based on a cost-benefit analysis by individual airlines and/or the Kremlin,&quot; he said. &quot;What are the (perceived) economic and societal costs of airspace restrictions versus the current state of affairs?&quot; Emergency services work at the crash site of an Azerbaijan Airlines passenger plane near Aktau, Kazakhstan on Dec. 25, 2024.

(Stringer / AFP via Getty Images)Meanwhile, Layton argued that &quot;Russia&apos;s large size makes air transport a very important means of travel.&quot; &quot;Combining that with the desire of the Russian government for civilian air operations to continue as normal, it is unlikely that parts of Russian airspace will be permanently closed,&quot; he added. &quot;On the other hand, short duration closures due to Ukrainian missile and drone attacks and Russian air defense responses may become increasingly common in airspace in western Russia and within, say, 750 kilometers of Ukraine.&quot; Apart from shining a spotlight on air safety, the Dec. 25 crash may also create problems for Russia&apos;s relations with Azerbaijan, from which the plane flew, and Kazakhstan, where it ended up crashing. &quot;Azerbaijan is asserting itself and has serious ambitions,&quot; Vadim Dubnov, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;A state with such ambitions, as a regional leader, cannot afford to let such things (as the plane crash) slide.&quot; Dubnov also said that &quot;Azerbaijan leads the shortlist of countries that have learned to convert neutrality into benefits.&quot; &quot;It doesn&apos;t condemn Russia but maintains a certain level of decorum toward Ukraine,&quot; he added. &quot;Azerbaijan is using Russia and the current situation to strengthen itself and realize its own ambitions. The war helps it greatly, and Azerbaijan is exploiting it to the fullest.&quot; Dubnov said that during negotiations with Russia, Azerbaijan would likely recall that Baku apologized to Moscow after shooting down a Russian helicopter by mistake during the 2020 war in Nagorno-Karabakh, a former Armenian-backed entity on Azeri territory. He also argued that &quot;for Russia, the situation is much more complicated&quot; since it is unlikely to directly admit that its air defense was responsible for the crash. &quot;(Russia) needs to acknowledge many things that it has never recognized before, which will also evoke numerous allusions, including comparisons to the Malaysian Boeing incident,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time, it cannot afford to ruin relations with Azerbaijan, nor can it completely ignore Azerbaijan&apos;s demands.&quot; Dubnov said, however, that Russia and Azerbaijan would likely do their best to prevent their relations from deteriorating. &quot;Russia and Azerbaijan, as states that are quite similar in the style and aesthetics of their governance, understand each other&apos;s situations and difficulties,&quot; he said. &quot;They have time to find a formula that will satisfy both sides. However, it will be very difficult, especially for Russia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijani-airlines-crash-highlights-russias-failure-to-close-its-airspace-in-wartime/	2024-12-28T08:41:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749833.jpg
Top Russian-friendly politician resurfaces in Ukraine, emboldened by a chance of elections	A video published on TikTok by Yuriy Boyko, a pro-Russian lawmaker and former head of the banned Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, was met with public outrage in Ukraine. In his Dec. 14 video, Boyko repeated long-standing Russian propaganda points of radicals controlling Ukrainian streets. Sitting in his office and looking at the camera, Boyko said that alleged &quot;radicals&quot; in Ukraine &quot;started demolishing monuments, renaming towns, forbidding people to speak their native language&quot; and not allowing people to &quot;go to the church they want to go to.&quot; Yet, Boyko wasn&apos;t recording the video from Moscow, he was doing so from Kyiv. Despite three years of all-out war, the businessmen and politicians with strong ties to Moscow were able to keep their standing in Ukraine. &quot;Sometimes, I attend events organized by diplomatic missions of other countries. I regularly see Boyko there. And I always have the same question: why is he here and not in jail?&quot; politician and volunteer Serhiy Prytula said. As talks about potential elections in Ukraine are gaining momentum, the Russian-friendly group began to speak up. &quot;This is a statement that launches a political process. The question is which one and why now,&quot; Mykyta Poturayev, the chairman of the parliament&apos;s Committee on Humanitarian and Information Policy, told the Kyiv Independent. After the public uproar, Boyko was questioned by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). He was also expelled from the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, yet only after the second try. In a subsequent video, the lawmaker apologized and called Russian President Vladimir Putin a &quot;war criminal.&quot; Despite that, Boyko did not delete the previous video and continued to publish new ones, gaining tens of thousands of views. Following the failed first attempt to sack Boyko, political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko wrote that the pro-Russian lawmaker had &quot;friends or sympathizers&quot; in all factions and parliamentary groups. He called this the hidden side of politics, which involves informal relations. &quot;It should not come as a surprise that Yuriy Boyko and his political comrades felt and still feel good under different governments and presidents. They knew how to negotiate with everyone. And this is the secret of their political survival,&quot; Fesenko said. Boyko, 66, is a well-known face in Ukraine. An energy minister under pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych, Boyko ended his tenure in government as the country&apos;s deputy prime minister during the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted Yanukovych and his government. In 2011, a journalistic investigation revealed that Boyko was allegedly involved in a corruption scheme now bearing his name, which is thought to be one of the largest in Ukraine&apos;s history. The state-owned company Chornomornaftogaz, which was subordinated to Boyko&apos;s energy ministry, bought two oil rigs in the Black Sea through offshore companies. The state&apos;s losses from the purchase were estimated at $400 million. The rigs had been occupied by Russia since 2014. Kyiv regained control of them in the fall of 2023. Ukraine regained control of the state-owned company Chornomornaftogaz on Sep.11, 2023. (Telegram / Defence Intelligence of Ukraine)Before his tenure as minister. Boyko led Ukraine&apos;s Naftogaz, a state-owned oil and gas company, and was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine for &quot;settling Ukraine&apos;s gas debt to Russia.&quot; With such a trail, it came as a surprise that Boyko did not flee in 2014, soon reinventing himself as one of the leaders of several pro-Russian political projects. Boyko advocated for Ukraine&apos;s &quot;neutrality and non-alignment&quot; and for granting the Russian language the status of the state language, proposals that echo Putin&apos;s ultimatums. Boyko ran for president in 2014 and 2019, coming in fourth place in the latter. Along with his tentative ally, pro-Kremlin businessman Viktor Medvedchuk, Boyko traveled to Moscow to meet with then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. The two visited Russia again in a few months. The SBU launched investigations into the trips, but there were no further developments. Boyko was neither suspected nor charged. The joint political project of Boyko and Medvedchuk, Opposition Platform &#x2014; For Life, secured second place in the 2019 presidential elections with 13 percent of the vote and 44 seats.

(Yekaterina Shtukina/SPUTNIK/AFP via Getty Images)Following the start of the all-out war, Medvedchuk was arrested and sent to Russia amid a prisoner exchange. Boyko wasn&apos;t touched. On the third day of the full-scale invasion, when Russian troops were moving deeper into Ukraine, reaching the outskirts of Kyiv, Boyko was interviewed by Russian propaganda mouthpiece Vladimir Solovyov. The politician claimed that his faction and people were ready &quot;to do everything&quot; to start Ukraine-Russia talks as soon as possible. &quot;I did not think about leaving Ukraine at all. If you leave Ukraine, you put an end to your political career,&quot; he said later. As the war progressed, Boyko rebranded himself, disowning his pro-Russian associates who had not done so. He condemned Russia&apos;s aggression and supported Ukraine in restoring its 1991 borders. Oleksandr Salizhenko, editor in chief of the political watchdog Chesno, said Boyko had been careful following the EuroMaidan Revolution, yet he soon drifted back to an outright pro-Russian stance. &quot;It seems to me that the situation is now repeating itself, in terms of various indicators, voting, speeches, and the rhetoric of speeches (in parliament),&quot; Salizhenko said. In September 2022, Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court banned the Opposition Platform. Faction members attempted to rebrand themselves, splitting into two parliamentary groups &#x2014; Platform for Life and Peace and Restoring Ukraine. The first one is led by Boyko. &quot;This is a Russian party sitting in Ukraine&apos;s parliament,&quot; Mykola Davydiuk, a political observer, told the Kyiv Independent. Olena Shuliak, the head of the governing Servant of the People party, praised MPs from the banned pro-Russian party for &quot;very constructive&quot; cooperation with the ruling one, without elaborating on the terms.

(Vasily Maximov / AFP via Getty Images)Some lawmakers and experts suggest that the remnants of the pro-Russian groups in parliament help Zelensky&apos;s party stay afloat by voting for controversial bills in exchange for avoiding sanctions or criminal prosecutions. Yet, not all were saved from prosecution. A number of pro-Russian politicians are now either behind bars, fled Ukraine or ended up in Russia. According to Chesno, nine lawmakers from two parliamentary groups, successors of Opposition Platform, have been suspected of crimes against Ukraine&#x2019;s national security. According to Salizhenko, after the outbreak of full-scale war, the lawmakers of the former Opposition Platform changed their approach to voting. &quot;They are trying to demonstrate their usefulness to the authorities. They want to be counted on,&quot; he said. He also does not rule out that Boyko will be easier to control than a potential pro-Russian political newcomer. Publicly, Boyko said that his group supports Zelensky. Poturayev called the allegations of a deal between the ruling party and the Opposition Platform a &quot;manipulation.&quot; At the same time, according to the analysis of the Chesno, in 2022-2023, 86% of decisions could have been adopted without the votes from the former members of the Opposition Platform. Only 9.1% of initiatives could not have passed without their votes. &quot;The lawmakers of the former &apos;Opposition Platform&apos; do not vote with the majority when Russia has at least some interest in a particular issue. For example, on the ban of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP),&quot; said Salizhenko. They voted against the decision to dissolve the Kremlin-linked church, a number of priests of which were charged with treason for assisting Russia during the war. Even though Boyko&apos;s statement on TikTok was harshly criticized by many lawmakers and top officials, the parliament barely supported his expulsion from the Human Rights Committee, failing the first round of voting. Throughout the war, Boyko posted videos on his YouTube channel, as well as gave interviews to pro-Kremlin former journalists from TV channels linked to Medvedchuk, that were banned in 2021 for spreading disinformation and Kremlin&apos;s propaganda. However, the launch of his TikTok channel brought Boyko back into public space. Although the social media platform is used by many Ukrainian politicians, Boyko&apos;s video has sparked speculation that it could be a sign that he is doing groundwork for the post-war presidential and parliamentary run. The law does not allow Ukraine to hold elections during martial law. Andriy Yermak, head of Zelensky&apos;s presidential office, said that presidential elections would be held &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war.

(Yevhenii Zavhorodnii/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)After Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election this November, Kyiv has shifted its rhetoric on potential negotiations with Russia amid growing expectations of possible ceasefire talks. Despite multiple media reports about the preparations for elections, Poturayev denied that the ruling party is getting ready for the election. Salizhenko questions the assumptions about elections, saying that it is impossible to even organize them now. Over 20% of Ukraine&apos;s territories are occupied by Russia, with electoral infrastructure destroyed in multiple settlements in Ukraine-controlled territories. Additionally, there are over 6 million Ukrainians abroad and another 4.5 million internally displaced. &quot;These multiple problems simply mean that talks about elections are too early,&quot; he said. &quot;Politicians should talk about how we are going to solve these problems related to the elections, and not about how to hold these elections as soon as possible.&quot; Hello there!

Putin 'appears to have ordered Slovakia's Fico to open second energy front against Ukraine,' Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Slovakia&apos;s Prime Minister Robert Fico recent threats to cut off Ukraine&apos;s emergency power supply in the winter, saying that it appears he has been acting on Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s orders. &quot;It appears that Putin has ordered Fico to open a second energy front against Ukraine, at the expense of the interests of the people of Slovakia,&quot; Zelensky said, in a statement published via his official Telegram channel on Dec. 28. Zelensky said this was &quot;the only possible meaning&quot; of Fico&apos;s threats, that arrived amid Russian attacks on power plants and the distribution network. &quot;Any arbitrary decisions in Bratislava or orders from Moscow to Fico regarding electricity will not lead to a halt in electricity imports to Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said, because &quot;Slovakia is part of the single European energy market and Fico must respect pan-European rules.&quot; &quot;However, they could definitely lead to a break between the current Slovak government and the European community,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry also commented on the issue, stating on Dec. 28 that &quot;Slovakia&apos;s supply of critical amounts of electricity to Ukraine is not charity: Ukraine pays Slovakia a lot of money for it.&quot; &quot;By making senseless threats to cut off Ukraine&apos;s electricity, which it buys and does not receive as a gift, Prime Minister Robert Fico is actually siding with the Russian dictator,&quot; the statement said, noting that &quot;currently these are the only two figures in the world threatening to leave Ukrainians without electricity in winter,&quot; meaning Fico and Putin. Both statements follows Fico&apos;s declaration on Dec. 27 that his government would consider halting electricity supplies to Ukraine, after Kyiv announced it would not extend the deal on transit of Russian gas to Europe beyond Dec. 31. The Slovak president had held talks with Putin on Dec. 22 during a visit to Moscow, in which they discussed gas transit, the war in Ukraine, and standardizing &quot;mutual relations&quot; between Russia and Slovakia. Despite EU efforts to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels amid the ongoing invasion, Slovakia, along with Hungary, remains heavily dependent on Russian gas. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates that alternative arrangements could cost an additional 220 million euros ($228.73 million) in transit fees.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-ordered-slovakias-fico-to-open-a-second-energy-front-against-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2024-12-28T08:21:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ficoputin2-6.png

Putin apologizes to Azerbaijani president over plane crash, yet doesn't acknowledge Russia's responsibility	Russian President Vladimir Putin called the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to discuss the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash that killed 38 people, the Kremlin reported on Dec. 28. The Kremlin press service released a briefing detailing a call between Putin and Aliyev, during which the Russian president addressed some aspects of what he called a &quot;tragic accident.&quot; The briefing stated that the plane made multiple attempts to land at Grozny airport during a Ukrainian drone attack, which was reportedly repelled by Russian air defenses. The press statement did not address the claims that a Russian surface-to-air missile may have downed the Azerbaijan Airlines plane. Putin apologized for the fact that the &quot;tragic accident&quot; occurred in Russian airspace and &quot;expressed deep and sincere condolences to the families of the victims.&quot; He didn&apos;t acknowledge that it was Russia&apos;s fault. He also said that &quot;initial investigative actions&quot; were underway, and that two representatives of the Azerbaijani Prosecutor General&apos;s Office were in Grozny working with Russian authorities. Officials from Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan were also working together at the disaster site in the Aktau region, the briefing concluded. Shortly after this briefing was published, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on his Telegram channel that he also spoke to Aliyev over the phone about the crash, and said the key priority was &quot;to conduct a thorough investigation to uncover the truth about what happened.&quot; He also called on Russia to provide clear explanations, pointing to evidence from photos and videos showing &quot;damage to the aircraft&#x2019;s fuselage, including holes and dents,&quot; similar to those &quot;caused by an air defense missile strike.&quot; The aircraft, carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic, crashed near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people died in the crash.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-calls-azerbaijani-president-to-apologize/	2024-12-28T06:33:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190903467.jpg
Russia suffered 421,000 casualties in 2024, 'highest price' since start of invasion, Syrskyi says	Russia has lost 421,000 troops in Ukraine in 2024, the &quot;highest price since the start of the invasion,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Telegram post on Dec. 28. The figure includes both dead and wounded and is part of the total losses of approximately 785,000 Russian troops since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. Syrskyi, reporting on the outcomes of a meeting regarding the Armed Forces&apos; activities, said that the Ukrainian military was &quot;maintaining control over strategically important areas, securing the western part of the Black Sea, and weakening the enemy&apos;s military and industrial potential.&quot; He also said that the Armed Forces also established the Unmanned Systems Forces in 2024, which are &quot;necessary in the conditions of modern technological warfare.&quot; This branch is the first in the world to use unmanned aerial, surface, subsurface, and ground systems, as well as robotics, in combat operations. Syrskyi said that compared to 2023, the volume of deliveries of unmanned systems to Ukrainian units increased 19 times, and the number of enemy targets hit and destroyed increased 3.7 times. He also said that Ukraine has reduced Russia&apos;s military potential through &quot;DeepStrike means.&quot; DeepStrike, a long-range strike strategy, gained traction in 2024 when U.S. President Joe Biden authorized the use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory on Nov. 17, closely followed by the first use of British-made Storm Shadow missiles. Since then, Kyiv has intensified its campaign of strikes on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Syrskyi also said that a decision had been made to extend the terms of basic training of mobilized personnel. Such a decision was announced on Dec. 27, when Syrskyi himself said that Ukraine&apos;s military leadership planned to extend basic military training to two months in order to &quot;increase the readiness and safety of soldiers. The initiative followed consultations with the General Staff, branch commanders, and heads of individual combat units and is aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces as they continue to face intense hostilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-suffered-421-000-casualties-in-2024-highest-price-since-start-of-invasion-syrskyi-says/	2024-12-28T05:46:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/Syrskyi.jpg
Russia detains suspect allegedly planning to assassinate defense official, pro-war blogger, Russian media report	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a Russian citizen who was allegedly preparing an attack on a Defense Ministry official and a popular pro-war blogger, Russian media reported on Dec. 28, citing a statement from FSB. The FSB claimed that the detained man was acting on instructions from Ukrainian intelligence, and had been allegedly communicating with them via Telegram. The man allegedly recovered a homemade explosive device with a capacity of about 1.5 kilograms of explosive &quot;disguised as a portable music speaker&quot; from a hideout in the Moscow region. According to the reports, the man was allegedly supposed to plant a bomb under the car of a &quot;famous blogger&quot; or under the gate of his house. He was also supposed to find the car of a high-ranking military officer in Moscow, which would then be mined. He also &quot;conducted reconnaissance activities&quot; at the residences of both the officer and the blogger, FSB claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine made no comments on the alleged operation. This news comes just days after the FSB detained four other Russians on Dec. 26 for allegedly preparing a series of attacks against senior Russian Defense Ministry officials and their families. They were also allegedly acting according to a Ukrainian plot with the aim to assassinate senior military officers. Both arrests followed the death of Russian Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov at the hands of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which claimed responsibility, on Dec. 17. In this case, the suspect arrested by Russian law enforcement on Dec. 18 was a citizen of Uzbekistan who claimed to have been recruited by Ukrainian special services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-detains-suspect-allegedly-planning-to-assassinate-defense-officials-and-milblogger/	2024-12-28T04:13:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
New railway linking China to Central Asia countries, bypassing Russia, begins construction in Kyrgyzstan	Construction has begun on a new railway linking China to Central Asian countries Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov announced at the Dec. 27 groundbreaking ceremony. The new route, part of China&apos;s economic expansion efforts, aims to expand Chinese commercial influence in Central Asia and Europe while bypassing Russian territory. &quot;This route will ensure the supply of goods from China to Kyrgyzstan and then to Central Asia&quot; and other countries, including Turkey and the European Union, Japarov said in a press briefing, as quoted by the Kyrgyz Presidential Press Office. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway is &quot;not just a transport corridor&quot; but &quot;an important strategic bridge that will connect the countries of the East and the West,&quot; Japarov added. Japarov also said the project would &quot;strengthen regional ties&quot; and &quot;diversify transport routes,&quot; increasing the region&apos;s competitiveness as a transit hub. The railway will run nearly 523 kilometers (325 miles) west from the Chinese city of Kashgar in the northwestern region of Xinjiang through the Kyrgyz border city of Jalal-Abad to Andijan in Uzbekistan. The $8 billion project has been in talks since the 1990s, but economic and political pressure, particularly from Russia, which the road would bypass, had stalled it until now. The Kremlin&apos;s growing dependence on China in the wake of Western sanctions has apparently eased tensions, as hinted by Putin&apos;s participation in China&apos;s Belt and Road Forum in Oct. 2023, where this railway was highlighted as one of its projects. China officially declares itself a neutral party to Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine, but Washington has continued to sound the alarm on Beijing&apos;s support of Moscow&apos;s defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-railway-linking-china-to-europe-bypassing-russia-begins-construction-in-kyrgyzstan/	2024-12-28T03:18:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/11111.jpg
Ukraine destroys drone storage facility in Russia's Oryol Oblast, General Staff reports	The Ukrainian Air Force struck a military facility in Russia&apos;s western Oryol region, destroying a drone storage, maintenance and repair facility, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Facebook on Dec. 28. The General Staff said this combat operation &quot;significantly reduced the enemy&apos;s ability to carry out airstrikes using kamikaze drones against Ukraine&apos;s civilian infrastructure.&quot; The attack took place on Dec. 26 and targeted a Russian Defense Ministry military facility between the village of Tsimbulova and the village of Rudnevo in the Bolkhov district of Russia&apos;s Oryol region. Russian news outlet Astra claims that the facility was hit by three British-built Storm Shadow missiles, and that two people were killed and seven wounded in the attack. This information can&apos;t be independently verified. The Oryol region had seen another Ukrainian attack on Dec. 22, when drones targeted an oil depot and set it on fire. The same depot had been attacked just a week earlier, on Dec. 14, when Ukrainian drones caused a large fire to break out. The fire reportedly burned for several days after the attack. The General Staff said after that attack that the depot in the region was one of the largest oil product terminals in Russia and was &quot;part of the Russian military-industrial complex, supplying the Russian army with petroleum products.&quot; Ukraine first deployed the British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 20, just one day after also deploying U.S.-made long-range ATACMS for the first time. Since then, Kyiv has intensified its strike campaign on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-drone-storage-facility-in-russias-oryol-oblast-general-staff-reports/	2024-12-28T02:15:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232-2.jpg
Russian airport suspends flights after Ukraine drone attack, official claims	The airport of the Russian city of Kazan suspended flights to &quot;ensure the safety of civilian aircraft flights,&quot; the press secretary of Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency Artem Korenyako reported on its Telegram channel on Dec. 28. Operations at the airport were suspended at 6 a.m. following a Ukrainian drone attack allegedly targeting the Russian regions of Voronezh, Rostov, and Belgorod, with Russian state media Tass reporting that 56 drones were shot down in total. This information can&apos;t be independently verified. &quot;To ensure the safety of flights of civil aircraft, temporary restrictions on the operation of Kazan airport have been introduced,&quot; Korenyako said. Such restrictions were lifted a few hours later. According to Korenyako, similar measures had been previously implemented and lifted on Dec. 27 in several Russian airports, including Kazan itself in Tatarstan region, Sochi in Krasnodar region, and Astrakhan in the namesake region. These restrictions come in the wake of the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane on Dec. 25, which may have been allegedly shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile. The plane, which was carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan to Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya, crashed near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. Several media reports speculated that Russian air defenses struck the plane during air defense operations against a Ukrainian drone attack in Chechnya on the same morning of Dec. 25. The same restriction were also implemented in the airports of Kazan and its neighboring city of Izhevsk after Ukrainian drones hit several buildings in the area on Dec. 21. Kyiv has intensified its drone strike campaign on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. On Nov. 25, drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) struck an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga. These attacks follow Ukraine&apos;s first use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia and subsequent launches of UK-made Shadow missiles, made possible after Washington eased long-range attack restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-airport-suspend-flights-after-ukraine-drone-attack-official-reports/	2024-12-28T01:00:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-990254422.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 784,200 troops in Ukraine since start of full-scale invasion	Russia has lost 784,200 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 28. This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,651 tanks, 19,970 armored fighting vehicles, 32,328 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,408 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1032 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 21,013 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-784-200-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-27T23:09:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003913401.jpg
Ukraine plans to open over 150 underground schools by fall 2025	Ukraine plans to open over 150 underground educational facilities by September of 2025, Deputy Education Minister Nadiia Kuzmychova said at a briefing on Dec. 27. Ukraine&apos;s underground schools are a response to Russian aerial attacks, which regularly target civilian infrastructure, including education facilities. Ukraine has initiated plans to build 139 underground schools and several dozen underground vocational education institutions, Kuzmychova said at a Dec. 27 briefing, as reported by the news outlet Suspilne. There are currently 79 underground education facilities under active construction, she said. Construction is ongoing in front-line regions and areas most affected by Russian shelling. &quot;We expect the construction of absolutely all facilities to be completed by September 1, 2025,&quot; Kuzmychova said. Kharkiv was the first Ukrainian city to open schools underground to protect students from shelling and aerial attacks, while still offering in-person learning. The city operates schools in its metro stations. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has damaged one in every seven Ukrainian schools and completely destroyed over 400 educational institutions, the Education Ministry reported in February 2024. When the school year began in September 2024, Russian strikes damaged at least 12 education facilities in just three days, leading to dozens of casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-open-up-to-10-underground-schools-by-year-end/	2024-12-27T22:08:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190153231.jpg
North Korean troops suffer over 1,000 losses in Kursk Oblast in past week, White House official says	North Korean troops are experiencing mass casualties while fighting alongside Russian forces against Ukraine in Kursk Oblast, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Dec. 27. The comments come a day after Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) on Dec. 26 reported that North Korean troops had suffered heavy losses in Kursk Oblast. The White House believes more than 1,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded over the past week alone, Kirby said in a press briefing. &quot;It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defenses,&quot; he said. Kirby said that North Korean units had been carrying out &quot;human wave&quot; attacks against Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, with little effect. North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than surrender to Ukrainian troops, out of fear their families will be targeted over their capture, Kirby added. &quot;I hope they&apos;re loading up their commanders with a bunch of body bags, because they&apos;re clearly going to need it,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured since their deployment in Kursk Oblast. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. The first confirmed battles between Ukrainian and North Korean units occurred on Nov. 5. Ukraine first began its surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Ukrainian forces have been fighting to hold onto territory in the region ever since, in hopes it can be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-endure-mass-casualties-in-russias-war-against-ukraine-john-kirby-says/	2024-12-27T21:33:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1258328646.jpg
Ukrainian drones can hit targets 2,000 km away, military intelligence claims	Kyiv possesses drones capable of operating at a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers (roughly 1,243 miles), Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) spokesperson Andrii Yusov said on Dec. 27. While Ukraine does not always provide official comment on claims of drone strikes within Russia, Ukrainian drones have reportedly hit targets over 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from the front line. &quot;From what we can tell &#x2014; it&apos;s no longer a secret &#x2014; Ukrainian long-range unmanned aerial vehicles can hypothetically operate up to 2,000 kilometers,&quot; Yusov alleged in a television interview with the Ukrainian outlet News.LIVE. &quot;In most other cases, we neither confirm nor deny. I can only say that there is a reason for the explosions.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify Yusov&apos;s claims. Yusov added that all Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory target military and industrial facilities, rather than civilian infrastructure. Ukraine has recently championed the development of long-range &quot;missile-drones,&quot; upgraded UAVs with turbojet engines that can act as alternatives to cruise missiles. Kyiv unveiled its Palianytsia and Peklo hybrids in the second half of 2024. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year. Sources in HUR told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine was behind a drone attack against a Russian naval base in the Dagestan Republic on Nov. 6. The drone hit the port city of Kaspiysk, 1,000 kilometers from the front line. In May, a Ukrainian long-range drone reportedly struck a Russian radar system in Orsk, covering a distance of 1,800 kilometers (around 1,200 miles).	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-can-hit-targets-2-000-km-away-military-intelligence-claims/	2024-12-27T21:08:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1252671748.jpg
US to send $1.25 billion in military aid to Ukraine, AP reports	The U.S. is planning to send $1.25 billion in military aid to Ukraine, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 27, citing unnamed U.S. officials. The announcement is expected to come on Dec. 30, officials said. The outgoing White House administration has ramped up materiel shipments to Ukraine in the weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Previously, the U.S. announced $500 million in military aid for Ukraine on Dec. 12. The upcoming aid package is expected to include a substantial supply of munitions, officials told AP. This includes munitions for crucial air defense systems, such as the Hawk air defense system and the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS). Stinger missiles and artillery rounds (105- and 155-mm) will also likely be provided, U.S. officials said. The promised air defense delivery comes as Ukraine faces intensifying Russian aerial attacks &#xA0;targeting critical energy infrastructure. Russia directed a mass missile and drone strike against Ukraine&apos;s power grid on Christmas morning, leading U.S. President Joe Biden to promise a &quot;surge&quot; of weapons deliveries to Kyiv in response. Ukraine on Dec. 3 asked NATO countries for at least 20 air defense systems to repel Russian attacks. The situation on the ground is also &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;trending towards escalation,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 9. Russia has been making &#xA0;a series of territorial gains in eastern Ukraine, advancing in Donetsk Oblast and now attempting to shift its offensive into the south.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-send-1-25-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-on-monday/	2024-12-27T19:27:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173768444.jpg
Drone strike damages railway line in Russia's Voronezh Oblast, governor claims	Debris from an intercepted drone damaged the contact network of a railway in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast overnight on Dec. 28, regional Governor Alexander Gusev alleged. Russian air defense units downed over 10 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over Voronezh Oblast, Gusev said. Fragments from one of the drones struck the overhead contact system of a local railway. The damage resulted in the delay of at least one train, and ongoing delays are expected, Gusev said. Emergency services are currently at work on the scene. No casualties have been reported from the drone attack. The governor did not identify the district where damage occurred. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Gusev&apos;s claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Gusev alleged that a Ukrainian drone strike targeted two industrial facilities in Voronezh Oblast on Oct. 27.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-strike-damages-railway-line-in-russias-voronezh-oblast-governor-claims/	2024-12-27T18:48:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-971969650.jpg
Kyiv running out of ATACMS missiles, NYT reports	Ukraine&apos;s stockpiles of U.S.-supplied long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) are running low, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 27, citing senior U.S. officials. ATACMS are long-range ballistic missiles that can fly up to 300 kilometers (about 186 miles). The U.S. eased restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of ATACMS in November 2024, allowing Kyiv to launch them against military targets in Russia. Ukraine is now limiting these attacks due to a dwindling supply of the weapons and potential changes in U.S. policy, the NYT reported. Two senior U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the NYT that when U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv the green light to launch ATACMS into Russian territory, Ukraine likely had only about 50 of the missiles left in its arsenal. Following Biden&apos;s change in policy &#x2014;&#xA0;which was accompanied by permission from the U.K. to attack Russia with British long-range Storm Shadows &#x2014;&#xA0;Ukraine launched a series of missile strikes against Russian airfields, military facilities, and weapons factories. Ukraine has not publicly commented on these strikes, but the Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that Kyiv has lanuched at least 31 ATACMS and 14 Storm Shadows since late November. Ukraine will not likely be able to replenish its missile stockpiles, the two U.S. officials said. Washington has already assigned its own limited arsenal of ATACMS to destinations in Asia and the Middle East. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also said he disagrees &quot;very vehemently&quot; with the decision to permit Ukrainian long-range strikes against Russia with American weapons. He may rescind permissions when he takes office in January 2025 and is not expected to increase missile shipments. Kyiv first began receiving an older, shorter-range model of ATACMS in fall of 2023. In the spring of 2024, the U.S. began shipping updated models with a range of up to 300 kilometers. &#xA0;At the time, Ukraine was only permitted to deploy these missiles against targets in occupied Ukrainian territory. Despite persistent lobbying from President Volodymyr Zelensky to ease restrictions on long-range strikes, Biden delayed doing so out of fear of escalating conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes against Russia have not led to significant escalations thus far. The senior officials told the NYT that they believe Russia wants to avoid military escalation due to its recent battlefield gains and Trump&apos;s expected push for negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-running-out-of-atacms-missiles-nyt-reports/	2024-12-27T18:07:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/main.jpeg
Slovakia threatens to cut electricity supplies if Ukraine ends Russian gas transit	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced on Dec. 27 that his government will evaluate potential reciprocal measures against Ukraine, including halting electricity supplies, if Ukraine stops the transit of Russian gas to Slovakia after January 1. &#x201C;After Jan. 1, we will assess the situation and the possibilities of reciprocal measures against Ukraine,&#x201D; Fico said in a video address. &#x201C;If it is unavoidable, we will halt the electricity supplies that Ukraine needs during grid outages.&#x201D; He also said that halting gas transit through Ukraine would harm the EU&apos;s competitiveness. Fico met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal on transiting Russian gas to Europe past Dec. 31. While the European Union has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, remain reliant on Russian gas. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. &#xA0; Since taking office, Fico has shifted Slovakia&#x2019;s foreign policy, halting military aid to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric more aligned with Russia, raising concerns among Kyiv and European partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-threatens-to-cut-electricity-supplies-if-ukraine-ends-russian-gas-transit/	2024-12-27T16:14:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Zelensky urges China to help stop North Korean military aid to Russia	President Volodymyr Zelensky urged China to use its influence over North Korea to prevent the deployment of North Korean soldiers to the frontline, during his evening address on Dec. 27. He emphasized the severe losses, in Kursk Oblast, that North Korean soldiers have faced thus far. &#x201C;They have many losses. Very many. And we see that the Russian military and North Korean overseers are not at all interested in their survival,&#x201D; he said. Zelensky described reports of North Korean soldiers being sent into poorly protected assaults by Russian forces and are sometimes even executed by their own people. He called the situation &#x201C;a manifestation of the madness that dictatorships are capable of&#x201D; and appealed to China. &#x201C;The Korean people should not lose their people in battles in Europe. And this can be influenced, in particular, by Korea&apos;s neighbors, in particular, China. If China is sincere in its statements that the war should not expand, appropriate influence on Pyongyang is necessary,&#x201D; Zelensky said. China has strengthened its ties with Russia since the beginning of its full-scale war against Ukraine. However, Beijing has denied allegations of aiding Russia&apos;s war effort. Since February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has visited China twice &#x2014; first just days before he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and again in May 2024. Beijing has also positioned itself as a mediator, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-urges-china-to-help-stop-north-korean-military-aid-to-russia/	2024-12-27T13:57:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia's new Oreshnik missile relies on Western manufacturing technology, FT reports	Key developments on Dec. 27: Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, recently fired at Ukraine, was developed using advanced manufacturing equipment from Western companies, despite sanctions, The Financial Times reported on Dec. 27. The missile, launched at Dnipro on Nov. 21, was described by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a response to Ukraine&apos;s use of American and British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. Two key Russian weapons engineering institutes &#x2014; Moscow Institute for Thermal Technology (MITT) and Sozvezdie &#x2014; were named by Ukrainian intelligence as developers of the Oreshnik. According to the Financial Times, they posted job listings in 2024 that specified expertise in operating German and Japanese metalworking systems. The listings cited Fanuc (Japan), Siemens, and Haidenhein (both Germany) control systems for high-precision computer numerical control machines essential for missile production. Despite sanctions slowing the flow of such equipment, FT analysis found that at least $3 million worth of Heidenhain components were shipped into Russia in 2024, with some buyers closely tied to military production. Defense expert Fabian Hoffmann from the University of Oslo suggested the Oreshnik is not a wholly new development but rather a modification of the RS-26 Rubezh missile. While Putin has announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possesses only a small number of these experimental missiles. The reliance on Western machinery points to continued vulnerabilities in Russia&apos;s defense industry amid ongoing sanctions aimed at curtailing its military capabilities. Three senior Russian officers have been killed in a Ukrainian strike using HIMARS and drones in an occupied area of Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Dec. 27. HUR said it obtained intelligence on a planned meeting of the Russian personnel, and along with the Unmanned Systems Forces and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), formulated a plan of attack. Video released by HUR shows drone footage of several vehicles parked near a road. A large explosion is then followed by what appears to be the detonation of a cluster munition. The post accompanying the video says High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) were used in the initial attack, with strike drones later targeting an evacuation group. It did not state when the attack took place. According to HUR, the three Russian officers killed in the strike were Captain Nagorny Dmitry Olegovich, commander of the 1st battalion of the 135th motorized rifle regiment, Captain Krokhmalov Grigory Aleksandrovich, deputy chief of staff for intelligence of the 135th motorized rifle regiment, and Captain Fomin Yuri Viktorovich, commander of the anti-aircraft battery of the 4th Guards Military Base. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. HIMARS, whose prowess became a popular motif of internet memes, was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022. Initially supplied with GMLRS rockets with a range of around 70 kilometers, they allowed Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously. In the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS &#x2013; fired from HIMARS launchers &#x2013; with a range of around 165 kilometers, greatly increasing the range that Ukraine could strike within. The weapons system is a multiple rocket launcher system mounted to a 6x6 FMTV truck chassis, providing devastating firepower launched from a highly mobile platform. Its rockets are radar-guided, with a range of around 70 kilometers (over 40 miles). When combined with high mobility, it is the ideal &quot;shoot and scoot&quot; system to target enemy weapons dumps and command posts. HIMARS success stories are too numerous to count, but in February they were used against a military training ground in occupied areas of Donetsk Oblast where Russian troops were stationed, killing at least 60, the BBC reported. A U.S. $725 million weapons package for Ukraine announced on Dec. 2 contained fresh supplies of HIMARS ammunition. Ukraine&apos;s military leadership plans to extend basic military training to two months to enhance the preparedness and safety of soldiers, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Dec. 27. The initiative follows consultations with the General Staff, branch commanders, and leaders of individual combat units. &quot;We are currently working to create conditions for the training to last 2 months in total. High-quality training means, first and foremost, the preservation of the lives and health of our soldiers,&quot; Syrskyi said. He noted that recent graduates had completed a revised 1.5-month training course, an improvement from the previous 30-day standard. While an additional 5-14 days of training within military units is planned, intense battlefield conditions have sometimes limited this step. Syrskyi emphasized the importance of addressing training challenges and updating basic military training standards to meet current needs. These efforts complement broader reforms under General Mykhailo Drapatyi, appointed commander of Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces on Dec. 12. Drapatyi&apos;s vision includes transforming the Ground Forces into an &quot;elite&quot; military unit by modernizing training programs, integrating advanced technology, and prioritizing social support for service members. In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military suffered from a lack of training facilities for new soldiers, citing the Ukrainian military. The planned changes aim to improve the effectiveness of Ukrainian forces as they continue to face intense hostilities. Russia has significantly increased the production of Shahed-136 drones and cheaper decoy drones at the Yelabuga drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan, CNN reported on Dec. 27. This facility, located over 1,300 kilometers from the Ukraine border, plays a critical role in Moscow&apos;s drone manufacturing strategy. In 2023, the factory produced 2,738 Shahed-136-type drones, given the name Geran in Russia, with output more than doubling to 5,760 units in the first nine months of 2024. The facility also began serial production of &quot;Gerbera&quot; decoy drones, which mimic the radar signature of real Shaheds but are made from plywood and foam plastic. Russia plans to produce 10,000 Gerberas by the end of 2024, twice the number of Geran drones. Each Gerbera reportedly costs 10 times less to produce than a Geran. The production surge is facilitated by imports of components from China and the recruitment of low-skilled labor, including local teenagers and workers from Africa. The Alabuga Start project actively recruits African workers for the program, according to the report. Despite official statements of neutrality, China allegedly supplies drone components and technology through a network of 34 companies. Satellite imagery from March to September 2023 reportedly revealed a 55% increase in production space at the Alabuga site, along with enhanced facility security, including anti-drone cages and a fortified perimeter. The Yelabuga plant, launched in July 2023, manufactures a range of drones, including Shahed-type drones and reconnaissance models like the Albatross. Russia regularly employs drones and missiles to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The plant has faced disruptions, including from Ukrainian attacks. On Dec. 23, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported a fire at a Shahed warehouse in Alabuga, destroying $16 million worth of drone parts. In April, in an effort to counter Russia&apos;s expanding drone production, Ukrainian long-range drones struck the Yelabuga facility. Ukrainian troops have thwarted a Russian attempt to gain a foothold on one of its islands on the Dnipro River delta, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on national TV on Dec. 27. &quot;Over the past day, (Russia) continued its attempts to land on Kozatsky Island, but was unsuccessful, suffered losses and was unable to land,&quot; Voloshyn said, adding that Russia had suffered &quot;losses in equipment, in particular, in boats, watercraft, and personnel.&quot; Voloshyn added that Russia suffered about 150 military losses as well as equipment, including two tanks, amid fighting in the region. Voloshyn&apos;s comments comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops carried out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 26 that the region was &quot;observing an increase in enemy activity&quot; from sabotage groups, attempting to gain a foothold. On Dec. 26, Voloshyn said that the Russian military has been trying to advance on Kozatsky Island, Velykyi Potemkin Island, and the southern island of Zabych in recent weeks, and are likely seeking to seize a bridgehead on the western bank of the Dnipro River in order to transfer firepower there. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, pushing Russian troops to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russias-new-oreshnik-missile-relies-on-western-manufacturing-technology-ft-reports/	2024-12-27T11:39:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2071909815.jpg
US officials believe Ukraine may be forced to retreat from Kursk Oblast in spring, Bloomberg reports	U.S. officials told Bloomberg on Dec. 27 that they believe Ukraine may only have a few months left in its incursion into Kursk Oblast until Ukraine&apos;s military is forced to retreat from the region or risk being encircled by Russian forces. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, two U.S. officials told Bloomberg that it was their hope President Volodymyr Zelensky will retreat from Kursk Oblast in order to avoid suffering high casualties, amid an ongoing Russian offensive to retake the territory. Ukraine first gained a foothold in Kursk Oblast during a surprise incursion into the Russian region in early August. Since then, Russia has launched extensive counterattacks in an effort to take back the region. Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing a source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, that Ukraine has lost over 40 per cent of the territory it previously gained in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast due to the counterattacks. Despite territorial losses, one U.S. official told Bloomberg that Ukraine has managed to hold onto the territory longer than expected amid President Joe Biden&apos;s approval for Kyiv to use fire long-range missiles into Russia. Another official told Bloomberg they believed the intention was never to hold on to Kursk for the long-term but to provide shock at Ukraine&apos;s ability to conduct the incursion. Zelensky said in September that Ukraine is planning to &quot;indefinitely&quot; hold the seized territories of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as it tries to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. In addition to the nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, approximately 12,000 North Korean soldier have begun fighting alongside Russian troops in the region. Both Russian and North Korean troops have sustained heavy casualties in the offensive. Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that over 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded thus far. Ukrainian officials have previously said that they intend to use Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Kursk as leverage for possible peace negotiations following the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal, with Ukrainian officials urging the incoming president to take a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach when dealing with negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-officials-believe-ukraine-may-be-forced-to-retreat-from-kursk-oblast-in-spring-bloomberg-reports/	2024-12-27T11:36:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258245894.jpg
2024: Ukraine in photos	The year 2024 was brutal for Ukraine. Last winter saw the fall of Avdiivka when, after several months of brutal fighting, the Russian army captured the city leveled to the ground. Ukraine struggled to hold the front line with limited resources as political infighting in the U.S. Congress had delayed the passing of a crucial aid bill for months. In spring, Russia renewed intense attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, damaging or destroying at least half of the country&apos;s energy capacities within months. It plunged most of the country into hours-long rolling blackouts for most of the summer. Russia made Iranian-supplied Shakhed drones and domestically manufactured UAVs the main strike force of its large-scale air attacks on Ukraine, which continued until the end of the year, despite the long-awaited F-16 fighter jets beginning to arrive in Ukraine in July. Russia indiscriminately attacked civilian infrastructure, among them the country&apos;s main children&apos;s hospital, Okhmatdyt in Kyiv, galvanizing the country into helping to clean up and rebuild it. On the front line, the residents of northern parts of Kharkiv Oblast, liberated in 2022, had their lives upended once again with Russia&apos;s new push towards the town of Vovchansk in May. As the fighting in the area continued for the rest of the year, 80% of buildings in Vovchansk were destroyed, displacing nearly 22.000 civilians from the area. Russia began to systematically kill Ukrainian POWs, with 109 confirmed killings this year. The months-long ongoing advance of Russian forces towards Pokrovsk in the east was briefly overshadowed by the stunning Ukrainian Kursk incursion in August. Several months later, however, Ukraine lost at least 40% of the territories it had taken. Kyiv continues to hold the remaining territory, now fighting against North Korean troops in the area, in an attempt to straighten its hand if peace talks with Russia begin in 2025. The neverending war turned military funerals into a daily routine, with Ukrainians mourning the loss of prominent figures like poet Maksym Kryvtsov, activist Pavlo Petrychenko, combat medic Iryna Tsybukh, and thousands more. Ukrainian people rejoiced at ten prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia over the year that brought home 1,159 people. However, peaceful rallies in the cities continued to remind us that Russia still holds around 8.000 military and roughly 28.000 civilians detained in brutal conditions. A rare glimpse of joy was the medals that athletes brought from the Paris Olympics 2024, where record-holder high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh won gold in August. In the fall, the country saw the biggest wartime government reshuffle and braced for what Donald Trump&apos;s win in the U.S. presidential elections could bring to Ukrainians in 2025. The Kyiv Independent partners up with the Ukrainian Association of Professional Photographers to look back at some of the most memorable moments for Ukrainians in 2024 in photos.	https://kyivindependent.com/2025-ukraine-in-photos/	2024-12-27T11:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/6_danylo_pavlov.jpg
NATO to 'enhance military presence' in Baltic Sea following damage to undersea power cable, Rutte says	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Dec. 27 that &quot;NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea&quot; following the recent damage to the Estlink 2 power cable in the Gulf of Finland, likely caused by Russia. The comments made by Rutte on social media follow a conversation with Finnish President Alexander Stubb about the &quot;Finnish-led investigation into possible sabotage of undersea cables.&quot; Finnish police announced in a press conference on Dec. 26 that recent damage to the cable in the Gulf of Finland was likely caused by a Russian tanker believed to be a part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet.&quot; The Estlink 2, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia, was reported to be seriously damaged on Christmas Day. Authorities are investigating the incident as a possible act of sabotage. Spoke w/ @alexstubb about the ongoing Finnish-led investigation into possible sabotage of undersea cables. I expressed my full solidarity and support. #NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea. The ship likely belongs to Russia&apos;s shadow fleet, a group of vessels employed to help the Kremlin evade sanctions, Finnish customs officials said. Investigators are still working to determine whether the damage was accidental or deliberate sabotage. The anchor of the Russian vessel Eagle S appears to have caused the damage to the cable, authorities added. The Estlink 2 has remained offline since the incident and repair to the cable could take months, threatening the power supply in the winter season. The Finnish and Estonian governments are holding emergency meetings to assess the situation. Rutte did not provide details on how any &quot;enhance military presence&quot; may play out. A day earlier on Dec. 26, Rutte held a phone conversation with Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal and said that NATO stands &quot;ready to provide further support.&quot; Nordic countries have been on high alert due to increasing security threats from Russia. European intelligence services warned in 2023 that Russia could be preparing to sabotage power cables, wind turbines, and gas pipes, in Nordic countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-to-enhance-military-presence-in-baltic-sea-following-damage-to-undersea-power-cable-rutte-says/	2024-12-27T10:51:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187484276.jpg

Ukraine receives $485 million in humanitarian aid from USAID, World Bank	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in coordination with the World Bank under the PEACE in Ukraine program, has delivered $485 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Dec. 27. According to Shmyhal, $465 million in humanitarian came from USAID, while a further $20 million was provided by the World Bank. &quot;The funds will be allocated to compensate for social and humanitarian expenditures in the state budget,&quot; Shmyhal said. The additional humanitarian funding comes as the the United States continues to expedite weapons and military aid deliveries ahead of the January inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, amid fears Trump would cut funding. On Dec. 25, in response to Russia&apos;s mass attack on the country on Christmas Day, President Joe Biden directed the Pentagon to &quot;continue its surge&quot; of weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Trump&#x2019;s nominee for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, also criticized the assault, calling Christmas a &quot;time of peace.&quot; Throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the World Bank has also continued to provide funding to support the Ukrainian government in implementing reforms that strengthen and stabilize the economy. On Dec. 18, the World Bank&apos;s Board of Directors on Dec. 18 approved $2.05 billion in Development Policy Operation (DPO) grants to Ukraine, part of which is funded by a portion of the new U.S. $20 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-485-million-in-humanitarian-aid-from-usaid-world-bank/	2024-12-27T09:37:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1938968407.jpg
Fall of Assad’s regime disrupts Russian army recruitment in Syria	The collapse of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria following a lightning rebel offensive in November has shaken Assad-ally Russia&#x2019;s near-decade of influence in the country. It has also had one other lesser-known consequence: disrupting Moscow&#x2019;s ability to recruit Syrian fighters for its war in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent spent several months analyzing Russian recruitment in Syria. We uncovered that Russia has been luring Syrians to fight in Ukraine from at least March 2022 to October 2024, not long before anti-regime rebels overtook the country in December . It&#x2019;s impossible to assess how many Syrians were recruited to fight against Ukraine. Different reports cite eyewitnesses who suggest that groups of recruits sent from Syria to Russia could number from 45 to 500 people. But what is known is that the recruitment campaign was systematic and involved many actors. According to the testimonies of Syrian recruits and their relatives, Russian recruiters often resorted to deception, to sign up fighters from Syria. It appears that recruited Syrians were frequently used in the Russian army&apos;s assault units, notorious for their blatant disregard for casualties. Ukraine&apos;s intelligence dossier on Russia&apos;s recruitment operations in Syria, provided to the Kyiv Independent by a source, suggests that Russia had an extensive network of recruitment. Some of the information in the dossier can&#x2019;t be independently verified. Other assessments can be confirmed through reports in independent media and testimonies recorded by human rights organizations. According to the dossier&#x2019;s Russia&#x2019;s recruitment network in Syria operated at different levels. First, Russia used the presence of its own regular army and related structures in Syria. This included the activities of Russia&#x2019;s so-called &quot;reconciliation centers,&quot; set up allegedly to facilitate negotiations between the rebels and the Assad regime, as well as distribute humanitarian aid. In reality, the centers were used to spread Russian influence in Syria.

(Louai Beshara / AFP via Getty Images)It also helped that Russia&#x2019;s military presence in Syria had a wide network that included maintaining observation posts and conducting policing raids, under the cover of which Russians recruited Syrians to join the Russian army. Syrians were often promised &quot;work in the rear,&quot; such as guarding facilities, logistics, and medical support. They were offered tempting salaries by Syrian standards. Another arm of recruitment was the network of Syrian recruiters and organizations affiliated with the Kremlin-backed private military company Wagner Group. One of the best-known of these companies was the al-Sayyad Company for Guarding and Protection Services, also known as &quot;IS Hunters.&quot; In July 2022, al-Sayyad, along with its director, Fawaz Mikhail Gerges, and co-owner, Yasar Husein Ibrahim, were sanctioned by the EU over the company&#x2019;s activity &#x201C;in the recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to Libya and Ukraine&#x201D; and ties to the Assad regime. Both individual brokers and paramilitary &quot;private security companies&quot; affiliated with the Wagner Group were actively recruiting Syrians to serve in Libya before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In 2022, they began recruiting fighters for the war in Ukraine. Sanad Protection and Security Services was one of the companies actively recruiting Syrians. Sanad&#x2019;s owners, Ahmed Khalil and Nassser Deeb, as well as the company itself, were sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over its ties with Wagner, the Assad regime, and the recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to fight in Libya and Ukraine. After Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin&apos;s unsuccessful uprising in July 2023, the Russian Defense Ministry took control of Wagner&apos;s assets in Syria. Recruitment continued. Screenshot of Wagner mercenary group former boss Yevgeny Prigozhin claiming to be on the African continent in a video published to the &quot;Razgruzka Vagnera&quot; Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group on Aug. 21, 2023. (Telegram)Some &#x201C;private security companies&#x201D; involved in recruiting Syrians for military service in Russia were nominally independent but affiliated with the Syrian regime through their owners&apos; business connections. One such company was ProGuard for Safety and Security Services LLC. The dossier claims that ProGuard was authorized by both Assad and the Russian military to recruit throughout all Assad-controlled territory of Syria in 2022-2023. One of the co-founders of ProGuard, Hashim Anwar al-Aqqad, was sanctioned by the EU back in 2014 over his ties with the Assad regime. The recruitment operation involved Russian citizens as well. One of the largest recruiting centers in Tartus, a major port in western Syria on the Mediterranean coast, was run by a Russian, identified in the Ukrainian intelligence as &#x201C;Colonel Vladimir Surdanov.&#x201D; He was allegedly assisted by a high-ranking officer from one of the regime&apos;s special services, and a brigadier general retired from the Assad regime&apos;s army. The dossier also claims that the regime&apos;s special services representatives were directly involved in recruitment. Local authorities allegedly also facilitated recruitment. The alleged location of Russian recruitment centers in Syria in 2022-2024, according to a dossier compiled by Ukrainian intelligence. (Lisa Kukharska/The Kyiv Independent)According to the dossier, this was the case in most of the regime-controlled territories, including the cities of Latakia, Aleppo, Hama, Daraa, Damascus and the surrounding area, Rif Dimashq, Homs, Deir ez-Zor, and the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Independent Syrian media have also reported on the involvement of Assad&apos;s special services in recruitment. The reports mentioned that representatives of the General Intelligence Directorate, Syrian Military Intelligence Directorate and the Air Force Intelligence Directorate also participated in signing up fighters. These agencies dealt mainly with internal issues in Assad-controlled territory. Members of the Baath party, the ruling party of the Assad regime, were also involved in recruitment, according to a report by Syrians for Truth and Justice, a human rights organization that recorded the testimonies of Syrians who tried to sign up. Among the recruitment efforts was a dedicated campaign targeting those who were already serving in the Syrian regime&apos;s army, as well as veterans. As early as March 2022, recruitment was actively advertised on forums and social media. In one case, an ad of &quot;Deployment to Ukraine&quot; was posted on a private social media group of the 4th Armored Division, led by Bashar al-Assad&apos;s younger brother Maher. In other cases, Syrian officers selected soldiers for &quot;trips to Ukraine&quot; at their discretion. Among the most active in seeking &quot;volunteers&quot; for the Russian army were the notorious Russian-backed 25th Special Mission Forces Division, also known as the Tiger Forces, the 16th Division, various units of the 5th Corps, and the Liwa al-Quds, also known as the Jerusalem Brigade, a unit of Palestinians who fought on the side of the Assad regime. Some reports by Syrian organizations also indicated that Russian leadership was sending &#x201C;Syrian mercenaries&#x201D; mostly affiliated with the Wagner Group that had earlier served in Libya or Syria to fight in Ukraine Wahid Mursel Al-Shibli, a young man in his twenties from the town of Ariqa in the As-Suwayda Governorate in southern Syria, was one of the Syrians who fell prey to those recruiting for the Russian army. According to Syrian independent media outlet Suwayda24, a local intermediary promised him &quot;work in the rear&quot; and a tempting salary. Al-Shibli and six other Syrians from the same region were sent to Russia in February 2024. Six months later, on Sept. 15, Al-Shibli&#x2019;s fellow Syrian soldiers informed his relatives that he had been killed in the fighting in Luhansk Oblast in eastern Ukraine. In May 2024, the independent media outlet Suwayda24 published an audio message from Al-Shibli to his uncle. &quot;They made me walk on this. I&apos;ve never walked over human corpses before,&quot; the man sounded exhausted and desperate. He described the horrors of the war in Ukraine and begged to be rescued and to be brought back to Syria. &quot;Scorched earth... It&apos;s something terrifying... Bodies in the middle. Burned trees, burned people... The situation is very bad here&#x2026; So I&#x2019;m begging you, as soon as you get this voice clip, act immediately. It has become a situation of life or death.&quot; Al-Shibli was killed within the next three months. According to what his relatives heard from his Syrian comrades, he was abandoned on the battlefield after being injured, with fellow soldiers saying he couldn&#x2019;t be evacuated.

(Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)His story is far from unique. An independent Syrian researcher Qalaat Al Mudiq has reported on the case of Ala Batal, a Syrian recruit who fought for Russia. His family told Al Mudiq that Batal had suffered from neglect in the Russian army. After his first injury, he didn&#x2019;t get proper treatment. Instead, he was sent back to the front lines, where he was later killed. His family in the Aleppo Governorate was not informed of his death until two months later. The family didn&#x2019;t get Batal&#x2019;s body back. All they have is a photo of his grave in an unnamed location, presumably in Russia. In the photo, there is a funeral wreath signed by the Russian Defense Ministry. One of the rare pieces of evidence of how Syrians are recruited into the Russian army is a video that was obtained and shared by an independent Syrian media outlet, Suwayda24, in January 2024. It shows a group of Syrian men posing with their new Russian passports and mobile phones. They are thanking &#x201C;Dr. Akram&#x201D; for helping them obtain the passports. It&#x2019;s not clear if &#x201C;Dr. Akram&#x201D; is the man filming the video. &quot;Within five days, he&apos;s become a Russian,&quot; the man behind the camera comments, pointing at one of the Syrians. &#x201C;And everyone bought a phone... And cigarettes... And may Allah keep you under his gaze.&quot; From open sources, we were able to find that &quot;Dr. Akram&quot; is one of the intermediaries and translators who was assisting Syrians and recruits from other Arabic-speaking countries in Russia. From local media reports, it appears that &quot;Dr. Akram&quot; worked with one of the most notorious recruiters, Wassim Fawaz al-Dimashqi, who previously worked for Wagner Group and recruited Syrians to Libya. Syrian media sources indicate that al-Dimashqi&apos;s activities were so reckless that he was even arrested by Assad&apos;s special services in March 2024 &quot;for forging travel documents.&quot; The Ukrainian intelligence dossier also points to al-Dimashqi as one of the most active recruiters in the As-Suwayda Governorate. In an audio message sent home by Syrian recruits, published by Lebanese-born journalist Wadei Al-Hayek in February 2024, a person identified as one of the Syrians recruited by Russia complains about being deceived by al-Dimashqi and his accomplices. &quot;We were sold to the Russian army...Wassim al-Dimashqi...is selling us,&#x201D; he is heard saying. &#x201C;We do not know the language here. We are signing papers and don&apos;t understand anything. The translator here has sold us out and has received dollars for us.&quot; The traces of Syrians in the Russian army are scarce and are sometimes found in unexpected places &#x2014; such as a propaganda video featuring a Russian military chaplain. One is a video published by one of the propaganda channels of Russian proxies in Ukraine in February 2024. It shows Archpriest Pyotr Gritsenko of the Russian Orthodox Church, who is identified as &quot;the Deputy Head Priest&#x201D; of Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;Special Military Operation&#x201D; &#x2014; the official propaganda term for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. The caption says that &quot;50 Syrians have arrived to defend Donbas.&quot; To support this claim, the priest talks to an Arabic-speaking man in a Russian uniform, who calls himself Bassam Seed. He only introduces himself and says into the camera, &quot;Pray for me.&#x201D; According to a native speaker of Arabic that the Kyiv Independent showed the video to, the man has a Syrian accent but the phrase may indicate that he is Christian. In another video, Russians are giving out gloves as aid to foreigners identified as &quot;volunteers from Somalia, India, and Syria.&quot; The scene allegedly occurs during shooting practice at a &quot;rear training area.&quot; One of the men says he is from Syria and introduces himself as Hussein Muhammad. The video appears to seek to demonstrate that foreigners support Russia and join its war voluntarily, but doesn&#x2019;t touch upon how the foreign soldiers ended up in the Russian army, or why they had to rely on aid to get gloves. According to the Ukrainian intelligence dossier, in 2024, the Russian military command sent Syrians mainly to Donetsk Oblast and the Kharkiv axis. Syrian media and human rights activists also mentioned the presence of Syrian recruits in Luhansk Oblast. In 2022, there were also reports of Syrians being sent to Kherson Oblast. In some cases, they allegedly were to carry out &#x201C;guarding missions,&#x201D; not only partake in combat. Most of those recruited also received at least nominal training from Russian instructors. Basic military training allegedly took place in Syria. After that, according to the Ukrainian intelligence dossier, Syrian fighters received a basic course in the Russian language and practiced using various weapons at training fields in Russia. Rostov-on-Don, a city in southwestern Russia bordering the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk Oblast, is most often cited as a place where Syrian recruits went through training or were temporarily stationed. Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod and Rostov oblasts, as well as Ukraine&#x2019;s partially occupied Luhansk Oblast, have also been mentioned. &#xA0; Sometimes, the path of Syrians recruited into the Russian army was more complicated and somewhat incoherent. Some were promised &quot;jobs&quot; far from the fighting (in eastern Siberia, for example). Victims of deception flew from Syria to Moscow or other Russian cities, where they boarded a plane to Yakutia in eastern Russia. There, the recruits received Russian passports and signed contracts (with the &quot;assistance&quot; of an Arabic-speaking translator provided by the recruiters). In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Syria&apos;s former President Bashar al-Assad during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 24, 2024. (Valery Sharifulin/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Shortly thereafter, to the Syrians&apos; surprise, they were told that, according to the terms of the contracts, they would have to undergo training at one of the military training grounds in Buryatia in Russia&#x2019;s far east, or in the western part of Russia. Their next stop was combat units of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence dossier suggests that Syrian recruits in the Russian army in 2024 were often killed in action. Some ended up in the Russian airborne forces, often used as shock troops. The Kyiv Independent hasn&#x2019;t been able to find evidence that any Syrians who were recruited and fought in Ukraine managed to return home to Syria. How exactly did the recruited Syrians get to the front lines? The recruiters and their accomplices used various methods and routes. The Ukrainian intelligence&#x2019;s dossier shows that one of the most common methods was to bring recruits to the Khmeimim airbase in western Syria, operated by Russia. From there, they were allegedly transported by Russian military transport aircraft to Rostov-on-Don, a city in southwestern Russia. Another method mentioned in the dossier implied that recruited Syrians allegedly boarded Russian commercial cargo ships that were traveling between the regime-controlled ports and Russia. The dossiers mention three vessels that were allegedly involved in transporting Syrian recruits: &#xA0;Lady Maria, Baltic Leader, and Sparta IV, all of which are owned by Russian companies. The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the claims about the first two independently. Vessels involved in illegal or sanctioned activities often disable their transponders so that their location or the ports they call at are not displayed in maritime traffic monitoring services. In the case of Sparta IV, however, Marine Traffic data shows that the vessel was at the port of Tartus in Syria several times between 2019 and 2023. In 2023, the captain of the Sparta IV, a Russian national Alexey Tereshchenko, was charged in absentia by the Security Service of Ukraine on suspicion of transporting military equipment from Syria to the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.

(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)Syrian media and human rights organizations also describe cases of recruits being taken from Khmeimim to Mozdok, a city in the North Caucasus with a large number of military bases, or Moscow. There is also evidence that in 2022, Syrians who served in Libya boarded Cham Wings, a private Syrian airline owned by one of Assad&#x2019;s allies, to take flights from Benghazi to Damascus. They were allegedly flown from Damascus to Khmeimim, where Russian Tu-154s were sent out for Moscow. In one case, a plane carrying recruits allegedly took off from the outskirts of Homs for Russia in 2022. In another case, recruits from the Latakia, As-Suwayda, Aleppo and Homs Governorates boarded a civilian plane from the airport of Damascus to an airport in the Moscow region, according to Suwayda24. One group of soldiers from the 16th Division of the Assad regime&apos;s army headed to Ukraine had to make a connection, according to a report by Syrian human rights organization, Syrians for Truth and Justice. Mahan Air, a private Iranian airline sanctioned in the EU over transferring weapons and related technologies to Russia, took them from Aleppo to Tehran. From the Iranian capital, they flew to Moscow, and then were taken to a Russian-occupied town in Luhansk Oblast. The end of Assad&#x2019;s rule in Syria means that Moscow will not be able to recruit Syrians, at least in the near future. But Russia&#x2019;s predatory recruitment of foreign fighters does not end there. Evidence is mounting that the Kremlin maintains recruitment networks in post-Soviet countries and dozens of countries in South Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Recently, Russia has been reinforced by the addition of the North Korean troops. In December, reports emerged of North Korean soldiers being killed in large numbers in clashes with Ukrainian forces. As seen with fighters from Syria, the deaths of foreign recruits at the front appear to have little impact on Russia&apos;s broader recruitment efforts. Nizar Al Rifai has contributed to this report.

Construction of fortifications in Zaporizhzhia complete, Shmyhal says	The construction of fortifications in Zaporizhzhia and nearby settlements has been &quot;100% completed,&quot; Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Dec. 27. Ukraine has been building heavy fortifications near the city of Zaporizhzhia in preparations for a potential Russian offensive in the region. Shmyhal said on social media that 1.9 billion hryvnias ($45.5 million) had been allocated from Ukraine&apos;s state budget to construct &quot;a total of 358 military strongpoints&quot; in the region, adding that &quot;hundreds of kilometers of defensive lines have been built.&quot; The construction of fortification comes amid warnings from Kyiv of a possible Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 25 that Ukraine is tracking Russian troop movement in the southern region, and has observed &quot;existing threats.&quot; Vladyslav Voloshyn, spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on Nov. 11 that Russia could launch a renewed offensive on Zaporizhzhia Oblast &quot;any day.&quot; Russia has also begun deploying assault groups to frontline positions in region, Voloshyn said. A renewed offensive into the region has not yet manifested, with Kostiantyn Denysov, Freedom of Russia Legion spokesperson, saying on Dec. 7 that the situation on the Zaporizhzhia front is becoming &quot;very difficult and tense,&quot; but the development was &quot;predicted.&quot; As Russia continues to advance elsewhere along the front line, the country&apos;s military is currently advancing at its fastest rate since 2022, according to analysts from the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said on Dec. 16 that Moscow aims to seize the entirety of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Russia has repeatedly attacked settlements, including the city of Zaporizhzhia, with aerial weaponry since the start of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/construction-of-fortifications-in-zaporizhzhia-fully-complete-shmyhal-says/	2024-12-27T08:15:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2107848216.jpg
Weapon' may have brought down Azerbaijan Airlines plane, Azerbaijan's transport minister says	Azerbaijani Transport Minister Rashad Nabiyev said on Dec. 27 that an Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed in Kazakhstan was due to &apos;external interference,&apos; with authorities investigating &quot;the type of weapon used in the interference.&quot; &quot;This is evidenced by the appearance of the aircraft debris on the ground and eyewitness accounts,&quot; Nabiyev said during a news conference, Azerbaijani media outlet Report reported. The plane, en route from Baku on Dec. 25, carried 67 passengers, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people have been confirmed dead. Initial reports suggest it could have been downed by a Russian surface-to-air missile. Footage of the plane shows traces of a large surface-to-air missile impact on the tail section of the plane, according to Russian independent media outlet Meduza. Similar-looking holes in the fuselage have reportedly been documented in numerous images and videos of military and civilian aircraft downed by surface-to-air missiles. Two passengers who survived the crash also heard a loud bang as the plane approached its original destination of Grozny, Reuters reported on Dec. 27. Kazakhstan&#x2019;s Transport Minister Marat Karabayev said on Dec. 26 that the plane had deviated from its course ahead of landing in Grozny. Online flight tracking website Flightradar24 said on social media that the plane was &quot;exposed to GPS jamming and spoofing near Grozny.&quot; &quot;The issue of turning off the GPS on board the plane also needs to be clarified,&quot; Nabiyev said. The comments by Nabiyev appear to be the first public acknowledgements made by Azerbaijani officials that a weapon was involved in the crash. Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially claimed that the plane collided with a flock of birds, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. Nabiyev&apos;s conclusions align with those of Azerbaijan Airlines who said on Dec. 27 that &quot;physical and technical external interference&quot; led to the crash. The airline added that it was suspending flights to eight different locations within Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/weapon-brought-down-azerbaijan-airlines-plane-azerbaijan-transport-minister-says/	2024-12-27T07:30:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749786.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 6	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 6 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Dec. 16-Dec. 22, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukrainian Parliament made a first step toward establishing consolidated public investment fund The Verkhovna Rada has approved, in its first of two readings, draft law #12245, which introduces amendments to the Budget Code aimed at improving public investment allocation aligned with the relevant International Monetary Fund&apos;s structural benchmark. The reform establishes a unified public investment fund to consolidate funds previously allocated across multiple programs, including infrastructure, environmental management, and energy efficiency. This fund will be managed by the Strategic Investment Council under the Cabinet of Ministers. Ukrainian authorities miss structural benchmark deadline Last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, removed the controversial anti-journalist bill (#10242) from its agenda, effectively delaying its progress. However, the Law-Enforcement Committee had incorporated amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code into this draft law, aimed at meeting a structural benchmark to address issues arising from the expiration of pre-trial investigation time limits. With no additional parliamentary sessions scheduled for the remainder of the year, it is now clear that Ukraine will miss the end-December 2024 deadline for this benchmark. MPs seek to block international experts from governance appointments A group of 56 MPs, primarily representing factions such as the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party and the Opposition Platform for Life, has submitted a constitutional appeal challenging the involvement of international experts in selecting officials for key state bodies. If the Constitutional Court upholds this appeal, it could significantly disrupt Ukraine&#x2019;s reform efforts by barring international participation in appointing leaders to anti-corruption agencies (e.g., NABU and SAP), judicial institutions (e.g., the High Council of Justice), the Accounting Chamber, customs, and other oversight bodies. This move raises concerns about the potential rollback of reforms and jeopardizes Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments to international partners. Parliament extended tax and customs incentives The Verkhovna Rada adopted draft laws #12266 and #12267, extending several tax and customs exemptions for 2025. Key measures include customs duty exemptions for ammunition and drones production components, tax breaks for the import of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), night vision devices and anti-drone rifles, postponement of Euro-6 vehicle standards implementation until 2027, extending VAT exemptions for the Ukrainian film industry during martial law etc. Parliament meets one Ukraine Plan requirement The Verkhovna Rada has passed draft law #6227, amending the National Program for the Development of Ukraine&apos;s Mineral Resource Base through 2030. The draft law should come into force in 2024 to meet the deadline set in the Ukraine Plan under the Ukraine Facility mechanism of financial support from the EU. According to the Ukraine Plan, this step shall allow to define the terms of strategic and critical raw materials, the need for regular methodological risk assessment of the level of security of their supply, the definition of a group of partner countries, and update the priorities of the national geological program, as provided for by the EU Strategic Critical Raw Materials Strategy 2030.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-6/	2024-12-27T07:28:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245855806.jpg
China’s Xi Jinping to visit Russia next year, Kremlin’s Beijing ambassador says	China&apos;s President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to Russia next year, the Kremlin&#x2019;s ambassador to Beijing said on Dec. 27. Speaking to Russian media, Ambassador Igor Morgulov said plans for several bilateral events were being &quot;drawn up&quot; but that Xi&#x2019;s trip was a priority. &quot;What can be said that is no secret, in terms of priority, is that the chairman of the People&apos;s Republic of China is expected in Russia next year,&quot; he said. China has strengthened its ties with Russia since the beginning of its full-scale war against Ukraine. However, Beijing has denied allegations of aiding Russia&apos;s war effort. Since February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has visited China twice &#x2014; first just days before he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and again in May 2024. Xi visited Russia in March 2023 where he was welcomed by his &#xA0;&quot;dear friend&quot; Putin. Beijing has also positioned itself as a mediator, sending envoy Li Hui on multiple rounds of shuttle diplomacy in Europe. China has criticized the U.S. and its allies for &quot;exacerbating&quot; the war by supplying arms to Ukraine. Beijing has been trying to enlist developing nations to join its six-point peace plan, which China and Brazil laid out in May. The six-point plan calls for: It makes no mention of Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity or the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-xi-jinping-to-visit-russia-next-year-kremlins-beijing-ambassador-says/	2024-12-27T07:20:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2179663881.jpg
Ukraine repelling Russian attempt to gain foothold in Kherson Oblast, military says	Ukrainian troops have thwarted a Russian attempt to gain a foothold on one of its islands on the Dnipro River delta, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on national TV on Dec. 27. &quot;Over the past day, (Russia) continued its attempts to land on Kozatsky Island, but was unsuccessful, suffered losses and was unable to land,&quot; Voloshyn said, adding that Russia had suffered &quot;losses in equipment, in particular, in boats, watercraft, and personnel.&quot; Voloshyn added that Russia suffered about 150 military losses as well as equipment, including two tanks, amid fighting in the region. Voloshyn&apos;s comments comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops carried out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. Kherson Oblast Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 26 that the region was &quot;observing an increase in enemy activity&quot; from sabotage groups, attempting to gain a foothold. On Dec. 26, Voloshyn said that the Russian military has been trying to advance on Kozatsky Island, Velykyi Potemkin Island, and the southern island of Zabych in recent weeks, and are likely seeking to seize a bridgehead on the western bank of the Dnipro River in order to transfer firepower there. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, pushing Russian troops to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-repelling-russian-attempt-to-gain-foothold-in-kherson-oblast-military-says/	2024-12-27T06:39:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1844442017.jpg
Ukraine completes preparations for second peace summit, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine has completed necessary preparations for the second global peace summit, though work is ongoing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 27 briefing. Following the first peace summit in Switzerland in June 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the second meeting &quot;should lay the foundations of lasting and just peace.&quot; While Ukraine aimed to hold the summit before the end of 2024, Tykhyi said the focus is on achieving substantive outcomes rather than organizing &#x201C;an event for the sake of an event.&#x201D; Addressing the summit&#x2019;s timing, the spokesperson pointed to global political shifts, including changes in U.S. and European administrations, as factors influencing preparations. &#x201C;Ukraine is now in a strong diplomatic position, as everything is prepared. But, of course, we need to prepare for this summit to take place and be effective,&#x201D; he said. The peace formula, central to Ukraine&#x2019;s vision for ending the war, remains the foundation of Kyiv&#x2019;s approach, according to Tykhyi. Kyiv has indicated plans to invite a Russian representative to the second summit, signaling a potential shift toward engaging Moscow in discussions. Swiss President Viola Amherd previously said that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be permitted to attend despite the International Criminal Court&#x2019;s arrest warrant.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-continues-preparations-for-second-global-peace-summit-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-12-27T06:17:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Belarus Weekly — 2024 in review: Drone incursions, deepening alliance with Russia, totalitarianism	In 2024, Belarus, under dictator Alexander Lukashenko, continued to descend into totalitarianism, imprisoning people at will and providing full-fledged support to Russia in its brutal all-out war. Lukashenko signed a number of bilateral treaties with Russia&apos;s Vladimir Putin, helping him facilitate the major East-West prisoner swap that saw spies and murderers return safely to Russia. Lukashenko also reignited a major migrant crisis at the country&apos;s western borders, effectively making it harder for people to leave the state. Here is the round-up of key events that happened in Belarus in 2024. 2024 ends with the Russian and Belarusian dictators, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, signing a security treaty after Russia amended its nuclear doctrine to include Belarus under its nuclear umbrella. The amended doctrine also lowers the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons by Russia. While the treaty&#x2019;s text was not released, Putin said it outlined mutual defense obligations, including nuclear capabilities, and experts suggest it may allow Russia to set up bases in Belarus and deepen Belarusian involvement in the war. Putin also said that the treaty provides for the protection of each other&#x2019;s constitutional order, a notable remark after Russian Ambassador to Belarus Boris Gryzlov promised Moscow would help Lukashenko quell any potential disorder during the 2025 presidential elections. Following the signing, Lukashenko requested Russia to station Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) in Belarus, just as he did with the nuclear weapons in 2023. Putin agreed but postponed any such move to the second half of 2025. The year saw another attempt of nuclear blackmail by Russia &#x2014; with Belarus in a supporting role. In May, the Belarusian Defense Ministry conducted snap inspections of tactical nuclear weapons launchers, which, while capable of carrying nuclear warheads, also double as conventional weapons, once again providing no confirmation that any Russian nuclear weapons are present in Belarus. The next major joint military drills on Belarusian soil are scheduled for September 2025. The NATO Summit declaration warned early in 2024 that the deepening Russia-Belarus military integration destabilizes the region. Tensions rose and fell throughout the summer on the Belarus-Ukraine border, as Minsk accused Ukraine of military buildups in late June, while Kyiv claimed Belarus concentrated forces near the border in August following Ukraine&#x2019;s operation to capture parts of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Lukashenko also provided Putin with a helping hand during POW exchanges this year. In June, he released five Ukrainians who had been jailed in Belarus on politically motivated charges in exchange for Metropolitan Jonathan of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.

(Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)In August, German citizen Rico Krieger, sentenced in Belarus to capital punishment for allegedly planning an act of terrorism, was released as a part of a swap that returned Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov from prison in Germany. No Belarus opposition figures were released as part of the exchange. At least 19 other foreign nationals remain behind bars in Belarus. They might be used in future prisoner swaps. Meanwhile, Belarus is growing more and more dependent on Russia economically. Relying on reduced oil prices, Russian loans and Russian markets for Belarusian exports, Lukashenko has had to deepen integration with Russia. Following Trump&#x2019;s electoral victory, the official Minsk actively seeked a seat at the negotiations table between Russia and Ukraine and security guarantees for itself. Political analysts said the moves are prompted by Lukashenko&#x2019;s desire to restore his international legitimacy, but also by his wish for a counterbalance to his dependence on Russia. Open-source intelligence project Belarusian Hajun reported 356 Russian drone violations of Belarusian airspace between July and Dec. 18. The count keeps rising, undermining Lukashenko&#x2019;s earlier promise of a &#x201C;peaceful sky.&#x201D; From July, the incursions began to rise sharply, peaking in November with 38 stray drones recorded in Belarusian airspace in one night. One combat UAV crashed without causing casualties but leading to the arrest of a witness. The Belarusian military reportedly downed drones only twice. The drones, targeting Ukraine, cross from Russia and are reportedly diverted by Ukrainian electronic warfare. Minsk has largely ignored Russian incursions and never publicly objected. Lukashenko, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of provocations, claiming it was Kyiv that had sent drones into Belarus. As Russia and Belarus continued to send migrants across the border into the European Union, bordering states &#x2014; Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia &#x2014; announced the Baltic Defense Line in January. Meanwhile, Poland launched its 2.5-billion &#x201C;Shield East&#x201D; to bolster its borders with Belarus and Russia with anti-drone surveillance and fortifications on the ground. Lithuania is also investing $1.1 billion in a military base close to the Lithuania-Belarus border to house up to 4,000 combat-ready German troops &#x2014; the first deployment of German troops abroad since World War II. Russia-aligned Hungary remains the only EU state maintaining ties with Belarus. Its Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Szijarto visited Minsk in 2024, calling for sanctions to be lifted. Hungary also relaxed its migration legislation to allow Belarusians and Russians to work and live in the country, raising EU concerns. Meanwhile, the EU pledged 170 million euros to fortify the union&#x2019;s borders as Belarus and Russia escalated their &#x201C;hybrid warfare&#x201D; by channeling migrants with Russian visas into the union. Following the killing of a Polish soldier patrolling the border in May, Polish authorities reinstated a 200-meter-deep buffer zone along the country&#x2019;s border and pledged about $375 million to modernize its 190-kilometer border fence with Russia and Belarus, erected in 2021. Poland also sought Chinese intervention in the crisis, citing complications for international trade under the Chinese Belt and Road initiative &#x2014; an overland trade route to Europe involving Belarus. While these measures have temporarily slowed the pace of the crisis, they haven&#x2019;t resolved it: In 2024, Poland reported thwarting 30,000 illegal border crossing attempts. The cross-border crisis reportedly took 59 lives between January and October 2024. &#xA0; In the wake of the migrant crisis, the U.S. State Department designated Belarus as a state sponsor of human trafficking. The standoff between the eastern EU member states and Belarus is a setback for democratically leaning Belarusians abroad and within the country. Out of 14 border crossings between the EU and Belarus, only five remained in operation, after Lithuania shut down two more in March. Leaving Belarus now takes hundreds of dollars in visa fees and hours, sometimes days, to cross the border via one of the remaining checkpoints. Furthermore, Lithuania has tightened restrictions on Belarusian migrants, citing security concerns, leading to a decline in the number of Belarusian residents for the first time in four years. Latvia has banned Belarus-registered vehicles on its territory. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko spent much of 2024 preparing to extend his 30-year streak in power with a seventh consecutive term as president. In February, Belarus held tightly controlled parliamentary and local elections. The voting, condemned by the West and dismissed as a farce by the country&#x2019;s opposition, was viewed as a dress rehearsal for the presidential race, the first since the sham presidential vote in 2020 caused widespread public protests. &#xA0; Following rigged parliamentary elections, the All-Belarus People&#x2019;s Assembly convened for the first time in a new capacity as the extra-governmental body. Despite its grand name, the body is increasingly viewed as a &quot;decor&quot; for the Lukashenko regime &#x2014; presenting the illusion of distributed power, while Lukashenko remains in sole control as the country&apos;s dictator.

(Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The latest presidential elections are scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025, nearly half a year earlier than is stipulated in Belarusian election law. The Belarusian Central Election Committee (CEC) announced on Dec. 23 that the incumbent, the heads of three loyalist parties &#x2014; Aleh Haidukevich, Alexander Hizhnyak, Siarhei Syrankou &#x2014; as well as a spoiler candidate, representing so-called &#x201C;constructive opposition,&#x201D; Hanna Kanapatskaya, would be allowed to run. The campaign takes place in a sterilized political environment with raging repressions. All but four political parties have been liquidated, and those that remain are loyal to the regime. Independent media have been dissolved or forced into exile, and branded &#x201C;extremists.&#x201D; The only remaining point of discussion now, political analysts say, is what percentage the Election Committee will &#x201C;allocate&#x201D; to Lukashenko on Jan. 26, 2025. Having no winning strategy, between calling for boycotting the election and voting against all candidates, Belarus&#x2019;s exiled opposition has focused on campaigning internationally for the non-recognition of the sham election&#x2019;s results. As the election date nears, Belarusian law enforcers have intensified intimidation, arresting and harassing dissidents. Belarusian authorities have also partially blocked YouTube and VPN services during major opposition events throughout the year, and Lukashenko admitted he would not shy away from shutting down the Internet completely if unrest arises during the vote. In 2024, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko began to pardon political opponents, sparking speculation about his motives &#x2014; which ranged from seeking sanctions relief and restoring relations with the West, to election strategy. The gesture did not imply any political reconciliation, as over 220 jailed Belarusians received political prisoner status over the same time. As I write this roundup, 1,294 officially recognized political prisoners remain behind bars, with the actual number likely much higher due to the authorities&#x2019; obstruction to reporting by human rights groups. Three prisoners &#x2014; Ihar Lednik, Aliaksandr Kulinich, and Dmitry Shletgauer &#x2014; have died in custody, bringing the total number of deaths of political prisoners since 2020 to seven. Eight high-profile prisoners, including 2020 presidential candidates Viktar Babaryka and Siarhei Tsikhanouski, the long-time opposition politician Mikalai Statkevich, and RFE/RL journalist Ihar Losik, have been held incommunicado for over a year now. Solidarity efforts in support of the prisoners and their families have been criminalized. Throughout the year, police raids also targeted diaspora groups, exiled journalists&#x2019; homes, and political activists in and out of the country. 2024 was the darkest and most repressive year for the Belarusian media, with the number of jailed journalists jumped from 32 to 45. Journalists are facing in absentia trials and repeated convictions, the Viasna Human Rights Center notes. Reporters Without Borders placed Belarus 167th out of 180 in its annual Press Freedom ranking, and among the world&#x2019;s four biggest jailers of journalists in 2024. Foreign countries are no safe haven for the opponents of the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. A former member of the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, a volunteer unit fighting for Ukraine, was extradited to Belarus from Vietnam in December, facing charges that could lead to his execution. Meanwhile, Belarusian activist Andrei Hniot narrowly escaped extradition from Serbia at the request of the Belarusian office of Interpol. He was incarcerated for over a year. Detentions at Belarus&#x2019;s request also occurred in Armenia, but didn&#x2019;t lead to extraditions due to a political conflict between the two countries. Sweden announced it would reexamine asylum applications from Belarusians after a Belarus citizen was extradited to Belarus and reportedly imprisoned soon after. Over 3,000 Belarusian activists, politicians, and journalists were added to Russia&#x2019;s wanted lists. Russia and Belarus also created joint lists of &#x201C;extremists,&#x201D; which are used to persecute opponents of the authorities. Opponents physically out of reach of Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime are subjected to in absentia trials. At least 112 Belarusian politicians and activists have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms and seizure of property without ever setting foot in a courtroom to defend themselves. Lithuania has asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko&apos;s alleged crimes against humanity, including mass deportation and persecution. Following the 2020 election, a regime crackdown forced over 300,000 Belarusians out of the country of 9.5 million. The Lithuanian authorities believe this might constitute a crime of mass deportation and have requested that the ICC hold Lukashenko accountable. While the ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan has confirmed the referral by Lithuania, no other countries have joined the effort &#x2014; unlike in the ICC case against Russian President Vladimir Putin, against whom an arrest warrant was issued in 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-2024-in-review-drone-incursions-deepening-alliance-with-russia-totalitarianism/	2024-12-27T05:28:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184329764.jpg
Loud bang heard before Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashed, passengers tell Reuters	Two passengers who survived the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane in Kazakhstan heard a loud bang as it approached its original destination of Grozny, Reuters reported on Dec. 27. The plane, en route from Baku on Dec. 25, carried 67 passengers, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people have been confirmed dead. Initial reports suggest it could have been downed by a Russian surface-to-air missile. The head of Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR), Kyrylo Budanov, on Dec. 27 said the aircraft had been hit by &quot;a Russian Pantsir S1 air defense system on Russian terrain.&quot; Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially attributed the crash to a collision with a flock of birds, causing the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. Speaking to Reuters, passenger Subhonkul Rakhimov said he heard a loud bang as it approached Grozny, after which he &quot;thought the plane was going to fall apart.&quot; The missile allegedly targeted Flight 8432 during drone activity over Grozny, Chechnya on Dec. 25. The plane had attempted to land in Grozny, but Russian airports reportedly denied it permission for an emergency landing, forcing the pilots to divert toward Aktau in Kazakhstan. According to Euronews sources, shrapnel from the explosion reportedly struck the passengers and cabin crew as the missile detonated mid-flight near the aircraft. Footage analyzed by independent media outlets Meduza and Mediazona shows damage consistent with surface-to-air missile impacts, including holes in the fuselage and traces of a missile strike on the tail section. The tail section of the Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) passenger plane that crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, pictured on December 27, 2024 (Meiramgul Kussainova/Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian officials have said the pilots decided to reroute from their original destination Grozny amid dense fog and a local alert over Ukrainian drones, but said it&#x2019;s important to wait for the definitive results of the investigation before speculating about the cause. Rasim Musabekov, a member of Azerbaijan&apos;s parliament and foreign affairs committee member, told Azerbaijani news agency Turan that it was evident that the plane was &quot;shot down over Russian territory, in the sky above Grozny. It is impossible to deny this.&quot; &quot;Those responsible for this must be held criminally accountable, and compensation must be paid for the deaths and injuries. If this doesn&apos;t happen, the relations will certainly shift to a different level,&quot; Musabekov added.	https://kyivindependent.com/loud-bang-heard-before-azerbaijan-airlines-crashed-passengers-tell-reuters/	2024-12-27T05:15:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190903922.jpg
45% of Ukrainians think Trump’s election will bring peace closer, survey finds	Nearly half of Ukrainians believe that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s victory in the presidential election could bring peace closer in the ongoing war, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology published on Dec. 27. The survey, conducted from Dec. 2 to 17 with 985 telephone respondents, reveals a blend of optimism and skepticism regarding Trump&#x2019;s potential influence on the war. Among those who see peace as closer under Trump, 15% believe it is significantly closer, while 30% feel it is only somewhat closer. Trump&#x2019;s previous criticism of U.S. military aid to Ukraine and his intent to &#x201C;get out&#x201D; of the war has sparked concerns that his approach may involve pressuring Kyiv into concessions to achieve a settlement. Among those who see peace as closer under Trump, 15% believe it is significantly closer, while 30% feel it is only somewhat closer. Overall, 23% of respondents think peace under Trump would be mostly or completely fair to Ukraine, whereas 31% believe it would be mostly or completely unfair. Another 29% anticipate a balance of Ukrainian demands being met alongside concessions to Russia, with no clear advantage for either side. The remaining 18% were undecided.	https://kyivindependent.com/45-of-ukrainians-see-trumps-election-bringing-peace-closer-poll-finds/	2024-12-27T05:14:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190485862.jpg
Russia ramps up production of Shahed drones, decoys at Tatarstan plant, CNN reports	Russia has significantly increased the production of Shahed-136 drones and cheaper decoy drones at the Yelabuga drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan, CNN reported on Dec. 27. This facility, located over 1,300 kilometers from the Ukraine border, plays a critical role in Moscow&#x2019;s drone manufacturing strategy. In 2023, the factory produced 2,738 Shahed-136-type drones, given the name Geran in Russia, with output more than doubling to 5,760 units in the first nine months of 2024. The facility also began serial production of &quot;Gerbera&quot; decoy drones, which mimic the radar signature of real Shaheds but are made from plywood and foam plastic. Russia plans to produce 10,000 Gerberas by the end of 2024, twice the number of Geran drones. Each Gerbera reportedly costs 10 times less to produce than a Geran. The production surge is facilitated by imports of components from China and the recruitment of low-skilled labor, including local teenagers and workers from Africa. The Alabuga Start project actively recruits African workers for the program, according to the report. Despite official statements of neutrality, China allegedly supplies drone components and technology through a network of 34 companies. Satellite imagery from March to September 2023 reportedly revealed a 55% increase in production space at the Alabuga site, along with enhanced facility security, including anti-drone cages and a fortified perimeter. The Yelabuga plant, launched in July 2023, manufactures a range of drones, including Shahed-type drones and reconnaissance models like the Albatross. Russia regularly employs drones and missiles to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The plant has faced disruptions, including from Ukrainian attacks. On Dec. 23, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported a fire at a Shahed warehouse in Alabuga, destroying $16 million worth of drone parts. In April, in an effort to counter Russia&apos;s expanding drone production, Ukrainian long-range drones struck the Yelabuga facility.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-ramps-up-production-of-shahed-drones-decoys-at-tatarstan-plant-cnn-reports/	2024-12-27T04:57:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2172645649.jpg
Ukraine working to extend basic training to 2 months, Syrskyi says	Ukraine&#x2019;s military leadership plans to extend basic military training to two months to enhance the preparedness and safety of soldiers, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced on Dec. 27. The initiative follows consultations with the General Staff, branch commanders, and leaders of individual combat units. &#x201C;We are currently working to create conditions for the training to last 2 months in total. High-quality training means, first and foremost, the preservation of the lives and health of our soldiers,&#x201D; Syrskyi said. He noted that recent graduates had completed a revised 1.5-month training course, an improvement from the previous 30-day standard. While an additional 5-14 days of training within military units is planned, intense battlefield conditions have sometimes limited this step. Syrskyi emphasized the importance of addressing training challenges and updating basic military training standards to meet current needs. These efforts complement broader reforms under General Mykhailo Drapatyi, appointed commander of Ukraine&#x2019;s Ground Forces on Dec. 12. Drapatyi&#x2019;s vision includes transforming the Ground Forces into an &#x201C;elite&#x201D; military unit by modernizing training programs, integrating advanced technology, and prioritizing social support for service members. In July, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the military suffered from a lack of training facilities for new soldiers, citing the Ukrainian military. The planned changes aim to improve the effectiveness of Ukrainian forces as they continue to face intense hostilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-extend-basic-military-training-to-2-months-syrskyi-says/	2024-12-27T03:29:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
Trump's China strategy hinges on crippling Russia’s economy	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is determined to confront China economically and strategically. This is a difficult problem, because so many goods purchased in the United States have supply chains with deep roots in the Chinese manufacturing base. If new U.S. tariffs cause the Chinese renminbi to depreciate, as seems likely, Chinese products will remain competitive, at least in the short run; and if the cost of Chinese imported goods in the U.S. actually rises, this will squeeze lower-income Americans and undermine the competitiveness of American manufacturers that currently use imported components. The proposed tariffs and associated bluster may induce global companies to shift manufacturing from China to Vietnam, Mexico, and other lower-wage countries, but will not bring many good jobs back to the U.S. But Trump could score a quick and impressive win against China: by turning Russia entirely out of Ukraine and restoring the pre-invasion borders. Such a dramatic diplomatic coup would boost U.S. prestige around the world and strengthen Trump&#x2019;s hand in dealing with China on other issues. It would also be straightforward: Russia is heavily dependent on oil exports, and Trump can cut Russian net revenue from these exports to essentially zero from his first day. Without this revenue, the Russian war machine will grind to a halt. Russia has a relatively small economy. Its GDP in 2024 will be around $2.2 trillion, which is less than 8% of the U.S. economy. Russia punches above its economic weight, literally and metaphorically, by allying itself with Iran (for drones and other military equipment), with North Korea (for artillery shells and soldiers), and with China (for essential components and consumer goods). In this Alliance of Aggression, China has by far the largest economy, and Russia has effectively become a client state. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought tacit approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping before invading Ukraine in 2022. According to credible sources, Xi asked Putin to wait until after the Winter Olympics in Beijing, and Putin did as he was told. He was wise to be deferential: in 2023, China supplied more than 50% of all Russian battlefield-related imports (including critical components for the Russian army) with a total value of some $5.5 billion. Without the ongoing availability of Chinese components, Russia&#x2019;s stock of missiles would be quickly depleted, and air superiority should shift decisively in favor of Ukraine.

(Thomas Peter-Pool/Getty Images)China does not provide these goods to Russia (or anyone) for free. Nor is it interested in Russian debt &#x2014; China&#x2019;s leaders do not trust Putin&#x2019;s ability and willingness to repay. This means that running the Russian war machine on Chinese components requires cash on delivery (or even advance payments). Russia generates that cash by selling oil for U.S. dollars. Almost all other Russian exports are quite small, owing to sanctions. But the G7 and the European Union agreed to keep Russian oil on the world market, largely because Russia is such a large supplier &#x2014; about eight million barrels per day (daily global consumption is about 100 million barrels). On his first day in office, Trump can announce that he will impose heavy U.S. sanctions on any company that pays more than $15 per barrel for Russian oil (and on anyone who participates in any transaction above that level). Any country that is deemed not to be fully cooperative with this policy should expect to face punitive tariffs. As Trump knows well, threats are sometimes most potent when no action is taken. During his first administration, he wanted Mexico to close its southern border with Guatemala, so he announced that he would raise tariffs every week until action was taken. The Mexican government saw this as a crazy threat, but one that was entirely credible, and they deployed their security forces to close the border. The additional tariffs stayed on the shelf. U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration worked long and hard to negotiate a G7-EU price cap on Russian crude, which currently stands at $60 per barrel. But while this initiative was a welcome example of cooperation among Ukraine&#x2019;s allies, at this price Russia still earns substantial revenue, because its marginal costs of extraction are low ($15-20 per barrel). Trump&#x2019;s preference for unilateral action backed by bombast and vague threats would fit the moment well. To the extent that more oil moves from Russia to China, the &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; of tankers that transport it should be harassed at every opportunity, pushing up operating costs and further squeezing Russian margins. Impound a few shadow tankers for suspected sanctions violations and watch the price of transportation for Russian oil soar. Even at $15 per barrel, Russia will likely continue to pump as much oil as it can, because Putin is so desperate for cash. But what if Trump&#x2019;s threats and actions push up the world oil price? This would please Trump&#x2019;s allies in the fossil-fuel industry immensely, while also encouraging and justifying more oil and gas exploration. (Yes, this is bad for the climate, but we are discussing Trump&#x2019;s realpolitik here, including what will get Congress fully on board with his &#x201C;Drill, Baby, Drill&#x201D; agenda.) A much lower oil-price cap, backed up with stronger sanctions against companies and countries that trade illegally with Russia, would leave Putin with no choice but to withdraw from Ukraine. That, in turn, would send a powerful signal to the Alliance of Aggression, and to the Chinese leadership in particular: Anyone who attacks a neighbor will suffer crippling economic consequences.

Ukraine sends 500 tons of wheat flour to Syria under humanitarian program, Zelensky says	Ukraine has sent 500 tons of wheat flour to Syria as part of its &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; initiative, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 27. The aid aims to help alleviate a looming food crisis following the collapse of the Russia-backed regime of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8 amid a large-scale rebel offensive. &quot;500 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat flour are already on their way to Syria as part of our &apos;Grain from Ukraine&apos; humanitarian program in cooperation with the WFP (World Food Programme),&quot; Zelensky wrote on X. The shipment is expected to feed 33,250 families, approximately 167,000 people, over the coming weeks. Each bag of flour can sustain a family of five for a month. &quot;We wish Syria and its people safety, stability, and recovery. We know the true value of these things,&quot; Zelensky said. Launched in fall 2022, the Grain from Ukraine program has reportedly saved 20 million people from hunger, according to Zelensky. As one of the world&#x2019;s leading agricultural producers, Ukraine has continued to provide vital food supplies to countries in Africa and Asia despite the challenges of Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sends-500-tons-of-wheat-flour-to-syria-under-humanitarian-program-zelensky-says/	2024-12-27T02:49:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/grain.jpg
3 senior Russian officers killed in HIMARS, drone attack, Ukraine’s military intelligence says	Three senior Russian officers have been killed in a Ukrainian strike using HIMARS and drones in an occupied area of Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Dec. 27. HUR said it obtained intelligence on a planned meeting of the Russian personnel, and along with the Unmanned Systems Forces and Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), formulated a plan of attack. Video released by HUR shows drone footage of several vehicles parked near a road. A large explosion is then followed by what appears to be the detonation of a cluster munition. 0:00/1&#xD7;The post accompanying the video says High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) were used in the initial attack, with strike drones later targeting an evacuation group. It did not state when the attack took place. According to HUR, the three Russian officers killed in the strike were Captain Nagorny Dmitry Olegovich, commander of the 1st battalion of the 135th motorized rifle regiment, Captain Krokhmalov Grigory Aleksandrovich, deputy chief of staff for intelligence of the 135th motorized rifle regiment, and Captain Fomin Yuri Viktorovich, commander of the anti-aircraft battery of the 4th Guards Military Base. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. HIMARS, whose prowess became a popular motif of internet memes, was a game-changer for Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022. Initially supplied with GMLRS rockets with a range of around 70 kilometers, they allowed Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously. In the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS &#x2013; fired from HIMARS launchers &#x2013; with a range of around 165 kilometers, greatly increasing the range that Ukraine could strike within. The weapons system is a multiple rocket launcher system mounted to a 6x6 FMTV truck chassis, providing devastating firepower launched from a highly mobile platform. Its rockets are radar-guided, with a range of around 70 kilometers (over 40 miles). When combined with high mobility, it is the ideal &quot;shoot and scoot&quot; system to target enemy weapons dumps and command posts. HIMARS success stories are too numerous to count, but in February they were used against a military training ground in occupied areas of Donetsk Oblast where Russian troops were stationed, killing at least 60, the BBC reported. A U.S. $725 million weapons package for Ukraine announced on Dec. 2 contained fresh supplies of HIMARS ammunition.	https://kyivindependent.com/3-senior-russian-officers-killed-in-himars-drone-attack-ukraines-military-intelligence-says/	2024-12-27T02:12:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/2024-12-27-09_32_20.jpg
Russia's new Oreshnik missile relies on Western manufacturing technology, FT reports	Russia&#x2019;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, recently fired at Ukraine, was developed using advanced manufacturing equipment from Western companies, despite sanctions, The Financial Times reported on Dec. 27. The missile, launched at Dnipro on Nov. 21, was described by Russian President Vladimir Putin as a response to Ukraine&#x2019;s use of American and British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. Two key Russian weapons engineering institutes &#x2014; Moscow Institute for Thermal Technology (MITT) and Sozvezdie &#x2014; were named by Ukrainian intelligence as developers of the Oreshnik. According to the Financial Times, they posted job listings in 2024 that specified expertise in operating German and Japanese metalworking systems. The listings cited Fanuc (Japan), Siemens, and Haidenhein (both Germany) control systems for high-precision computer numerical control machines essential for missile production. Despite sanctions slowing the flow of such equipment, FT analysis found that at least $3 million worth of Heidenhain components were shipped into Russia in 2024, with some buyers closely tied to military production. Defense expert Fabian Hoffmann from the University of Oslo suggested the Oreshnik is not a wholly new development but rather a modification of the RS-26 Rubezh missile. While Putin has announced plans for mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Russia likely possesses only a small number of these experimental missiles. The reliance on Western machinery points to continued vulnerabilities in Russia&#x2019;s defense industry amid ongoing sanctions aimed at curtailing its military capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-new-oreshnik-missile-relies-on-western-manufacturing-technology-ft-reports/	2024-12-27T01:42:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185738307.jpg
Storm damages Russian anti-drone barriers near Crimean Bridge, satellite images reveal	A storm in the Kerch Strait damaged barriers protecting the illegal Crimean Bridge from Ukrainian maritime drones, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported on Dec. 26 with reference to recent satellite images. The barriers form part of a network of measures, both on land and sea, set up by Moscow to protect the bridge after multiple successful Ukrainian attacks. The images, taken on Nov. 8, Dec. 16, and Dec. 24, reveal that Russia has yet to fully repair the barriers, which are constructed from old barges. The storm also sank two Russian tankers, Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239, in mid-December, according to Russian outlets Mash and Baza. The number of deployed barriers in the Kerch Strait has halved over the past month, according to a Dec. 10 report by the Center of Journalistic Investigations. In September, another storm washed ashore protective barriers made of plastic and metal barrels, underscoring their vulnerability to severe weather. These incidents have further reduced Russia&apos;s ability to defend the 19-kilometer-long bridge, an important supply route for Russian forces. Constructed after Russia&#x2019;s illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, the bridge has been a repeated target of Ukrainian strikes, suffering significant damage in October 2022 and July 2023. It remains a focal point of the conflict and a subject of legal proceedings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration between Ukraine and Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/storm-damages-russian-anti-drone-barriers-near-crimean-bridge-satellite-images-reveal/	2024-12-27T01:11:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243954958.jpg
Ukraine considers 60,000 citizens as missing persons, official says	As of late 2024, 60,000 individuals in Ukraine are considered missing under special circumstances, Ukrinform reported on Dec. 26, citing Dmytro Bohatyuk, head of the Interior Ministry&#x2019;s Department for Missing Persons. These cases stem from war, occupation, and natural or man-made disasters. The figures underscore the extensive humanitarian toll of Russia&apos;s full-scale war, marked by illegal deportations, kidnappings, and significant military and civilian casualties. Since the launch of the Unified Register of Persons Missing in Special Circumstances, over 70,000 cases have been documented. &#x201C;As of today, about 60,000 are still actively searched for,&#x201D; Bohatyuk said, noting that the remaining cases involve individuals who were either found alive or identified among the deceased. The missing person count does not include over 19,500 Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, Belarus, or occupied territories. Efforts to locate missing individuals continue amid the ongoing war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considers-60-000-citizens-as-missing-persons-ukrainian-official-says/	2024-12-27T00:42:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2153366565.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 6, injure 6 over past day	Russian forces launched multiple attacks across Ukraine, killing six civilians and injuring six, regional authorities reported on Dec. 27. Overnight, Russia launched 24 drones from inside Russia, as well as two Iskander-M ballistic missiles from Voronezh and Kursk oblasts, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. Ukrainian defenses shot down 13 drones across Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipro, and Donetsk oblasts. Eleven other drones were reportedly brought down with electronic warfare countermeasures. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian troops attacked an apartment block in Chasiv Yar with an FPV (first person view) drone, killing two civilians and injuring two others. Another civilian was killed in Novoekonomichne near Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Sumy Oblast, Russian forces shelled border areas and settlements 169 times, causing 311 explosions. One civilian was killed, and a private house was destroyed by the attacks, according to the local administration. Kharkiv Oblast also came under fire, with the Russian military launching a KAB guided bomb attack, killing two people and injuring four, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-6-injure-6-over-past-day/	2024-12-26T23:49:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184405015.jpg
Seoul confirms Ukrainian capture of wounded North Korean soldier in Kursk Oblast	South Korean intelligence confirmed that Ukrainian forces captured a wounded North Korean soldier during operations in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Yonhap reported on Dec. 27, citing the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS). The confirmation followed a report on the capture from Ukraine&apos;s military-focused news outlet Militarnyi on Dec. 26, though it did not specify the date of the incident. &#x201C;Through real-time information sharing with a friendly nation&apos;s intelligence organization, (we) confirmed the capture of a wounded North Korean soldier and plan to thoroughly examine the subsequent development,&#x201D; the NIS said. A photo of the soldier, reportedly injured, has circulated on Telegram, though details about his condition and status remain unclear. North Korean troops deployed in Kursk Oblast continue to face significant losses. Approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been stationed there since August to bolster Russian forces. Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka on Dec. 20 inflicted heavy casualties, including the destruction of a North Korean mortar unit, according to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR). Despite mounting casualties, Russian officers have ordered North Korean units to maintain their positions. HUR also reported severe logistical challenges for these troops, including a lack of drinking water due to active hostilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reportedly-captures-wounded-north-korean-soldier-in-kursk-oblast-seoul-confirms/	2024-12-26T23:15:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-26_21-16-58.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 782,510 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 782,510 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 27. This number includes 1,650 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,644 tanks, 19,951 armored fighting vehicles, 32,262 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,379 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,032 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,999 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-782-510-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-26T22:22:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2113280448.jpg
Moldova approves 10-year defense strategy amid tensions with Russia	Moldova&#x2019;s parliament, dominated by pro-Western lawmakers, approved a 10-year defense strategy on Dec. 26 aimed at boosting defense spending as part of its efforts to join the European Union. Defense Minister Anatolie Nosatii presented the strategy, which seeks to raise spending to 1% of the country&#x2019;s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030. &quot;The first step to implementing this was taken after the war in Ukraine started, by increasing budget resources for defense to 0.39% in 2022 and 0.55% in 2023,&quot; the document said, according to Reuters. The pro-Russian opposition in parliament mocked the strategy, calling it an unnecessary move against Moscow given Moldova&#x2019;s small size and limited military capacity. Adrian Albu, a member of the pro-Moscow Socialist Party, dismissed the strategy as futile. &quot;If, God forbid, we are subject to an attack from the direction of the Russian Federation, how long do you think Moldova will resist such aggression? Simply because we are shouting from a rostrum?&quot; he reportedly said. Moldova, one of Europe&#x2019;s poorest countries, lies between Ukraine and EU member Romania. As an EU candidate, it aims for membership by 2030 but remains committed to its neutral status, which the constitution enshrines. Moldova does not intend to join NATO but plans to strengthen partnerships with various countries and international organizations to bolster its defense capabilities. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 heightened Moldova&#x2019;s security concerns, with drone fragments landing on its territory and missiles targeting Ukraine passing through its airspace. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu, re-elected last month, albeit with a narrower margin than expected, accused Russia of attempting to destabilize her government. The new defense strategy also addresses the risks of the Ukraine war spreading, particularly near the Black Sea port of Odesa, which is close to Moldova&#x2019;s border.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-approves-10-year-defense-strategy-amid-tensions-with-russia/	2024-12-26T17:22:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1686329479.jpg
Ukrainian platoon commander charged with abuse of authority, accused of beating, humiliating subordinates	Ukrainian law enforcement agents have charged a platoon commander of Ukraine&apos;s 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade with abuse of authority, accusing the individual of beating and humiliating subordinates, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Dec. 26. Although authorities did not name the accused, Ukrainian media reported that the individual in question was Vladyslav Pastukh. According to officials, the accused allegedly beat at least three soldier while serving along the front line between February and May 2024. In one instance, after finding another soldier intoxicated, the accused kicked the soldier in the face as well as other parts of his body. In a separate instance, the commander ordered subordinates to tie the victim to a wooden cross, where the soldier was immobilized for four hours. In another incident, the commander &quot;beat another soldier over a dispute over the publication of a video recording on the internet about inadequate living conditions,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office alleged. While a separate alleged assault occurred when a subordinate addressed the commander &quot;inappropriately.&quot; The accused has been charged with &quot;abuse of authority by a military official&quot; under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code, Hromadske reported, as well as two other charges related to desertion. The commander faces up to 12 years in prison, if convicted. Pastukh was previously named in an investigation by Ukrainska Pravda that reported officers of 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade had beaten service members, extorted money from them, and tied one soldier to a wooden cross as a punishment. Pastukh&apos;s godfather and commander of the brigade, Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk, was taken into custody and charged with abuse of power on Dec. 19 for allegedly making four of his subordinates help him build his house in Khmelnytskyi Oblast in the fall of 2023. The 211th Brigade, formed in August 2023, performs engineering work, builds defenses in the rear, and does not participate in direct combat.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-platoon-commander-charged-with-abuse-of-authority-accused-of-beating-humiliating-subordinates/	2024-12-26T15:50:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/m76m3s---c16x9x50px50p--602bda4951e6be4174d6758bef644d4f.webp
Trump administration should make first move to 'restore dialogue,' Lavrov says	Russia is willing to improve relations with the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, if the United States makes the &quot;first move&quot; in restarting dialogue, Russia&apos;s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Dec. 26. &quot;If the signals that are coming from the new team in Washington to restore the dialogue that Washington interrupted after the start of a special military operation (Russia&#x2019;s term for its war against Ukraine), are serious, of course, we will respond to them,&quot; Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. &quot;But the Americans broke (off) the dialogue, so they should make the first move,&quot; Lavrov added. Lavrov&apos;s comments come ahead of Trump&apos;s January inauguration, who has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal. Trump has nominated retired general Keith Kellogg as his special Ukrainian peace envoy, tasked with leading negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Lavrov&apos;s comments come alongside those of Russian President Vladimir Putin who, on Dec. 26, provided contradictory statements on bringing the war to an end in 2025, saying that Russia aims &quot;to end the conflict,&quot; while also stating his hopes that Russia will &quot;achieve success on the front line.&quot; Following Putin&apos;s comments, Lavrov lambasted the possibility of a ceasefire, adding that &quot;a truce is a path to nowhere.&quot; &quot;We need final legal agreements that will fix all the conditions for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and, of course, the legitimate security interests of our neighbours,&quot; Lavrov added. Lavrov has regularly used distorted historical facts about NATO expansionism as the Kremlin&apos;s justification for Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Putin previously expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at any time to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. However, he reiterated Moscow&#x2019;s unwavering demands for a peace agreement, including the rejection of any territorial concessions and a firm stance against Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-administration-should-make-first-move-to-restore-dialogue-lavrov-says/	2024-12-26T14:28:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187729022.jpg
Russia 'not opposed' to having Slovakia host peace talks, Putin says	During a news conference following a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he was open to having Slovakia host potential peace talks following the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Responding to questions from journalists, Putin said that Slovakian officials &quot;would be happy to provide their own country as a platform for negotiations. We are not opposed, if it comes to that. Why not? Since Slovakia takes such a neutral position.&quot; Putin&apos;s comments come after Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Putin at the Kremlin during a visit on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal on transiting Russian gas to Europe past Dec. 31. The visit by the Russian-friendly leader was heavily criticized by EU and Ukrainian officials, with President Volodymyr Zelensky calling Fico&apos;s pro-Russian energy policy a &quot;big security issue&quot; for Slovakia and Europe. &quot;Why is this leader so dependent on Moscow? What is being paid to him, and what does he pay with?&quot; Zelensky asked in his criticism of Fico. Under Fico&apos;s leadership, Slovakia took a sharp foreign policy turn, halting military supplies to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks and adopting more Russian-friendly rhetoric. Putin&apos;s comments surrounding possible peace negotiations come ahead of the January inauguration of Donald Trump, who has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal. During his press conference, Putin provided contradictory statements on bringing the war to an end in 2025, saying that Russia aims &quot;to end the conflict,&quot; while also stating his hopes that Russia will &quot;achieve success on the front line.&quot; Trump suggested on Dec. 22 that Putin wants to hold a meeting with him &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Trump has nominated retired general Keith Kellogg as his special Ukrainian peace envoy, tasked with leading negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. The plan would also cut off military aid to Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to enter negotiations. The Financial Times reported on Dec. 20 that despite these proposals, Trump intends to continue sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine when he becomes president.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovakia-could-host-peace-ukraine-russia-talks-putin-says/	2024-12-26T13:19:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/fico.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine hits ballistic missile propellant plant in Rostov Oblast; North Korean troops endure heavy losses	Key developments on Dec. 26: The Ukrainian Air Force struck a plant in Kamensk-Shakhtynsky, Rostov Oblast, that produces solid propellant for ballistic missiles, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) reported on Dec. 26. These missiles are reportedly used to attack civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, including hospitals, residential buildings, and power plants. &quot;This strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the capabilities of the Russian armed forces to carry out terrorist attacks against Ukrainian civilians,&quot; Stratcom said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack is one of several recent strikes in Rostov Oblast. On Dec. 25, Ukrainian long-range drones targeted an ammunition depot at the Kadamovsky military training ground, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told The Kyiv Independent. On Dec. 24, drones struck the military airbase in Millerovo, according to local acting governor Yury Slyusar. Earlier, on Dec. 19, Ukraine&apos;s Navy and the SBU carried out a combined strike on the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov Oblast. These operations are part of Ukraine&apos;s broader efforts to disrupt Russia&apos;s military supply chain and hinder its ability to conduct attacks on Ukrainian cities. North Korean troops deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast continue to suffer significant losses, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 26. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the region since August to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. On Dec. 20, Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka reportedly inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean troops. HUR confirmed the destruction of a North Korean mortar unit, with additional losses recorded at multiple sites. Despite sanitary losses, including five soldiers on Dec. 20 alone, Russian officers ordered the units to maintain their positions. HUR also reported severe logistical issues for North Korean units on the front lines, including a lack of drinking water due to active hostilities. However, Russian forces have continued supplying these troops with ammunition and food to sustain their positions and resume assault operations. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured since their deployment in Kursk Oblast. Their casualties have been linked to their inexperience with the terrain and modern drone warfare, according to South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon. While North Korean forces have proven vulnerable to Ukrainian drone strikes, their presence has enabled Russian troops to make limited gains in the region, recapturing some territory previously held by Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian troops hit a Russian command post in the town of Lgov in Kursk Oblast, allegedly killing 18 Russian soldiers, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications reported on Dec. 26. Ukrainian forces reportedly hit the command post of Russia&apos;s 810th Separate Marine Brigade, located in an abandoned civilian building in Lgov, overnight on Dec. 25. Following the attack, Kursk Oblast Acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein claimed that Ukraine attacked civilian facilities and infrastructure in Lgov, killing four people and injuring five others. The strike killed 18 personnel and partially destroyed the command post, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications claimed in a Dec. 26 statement. A deputy brigade commander was most likely among the killed, and most of the killed soldiers were staff officers. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion in Kursk Oblast in early August. Kyiv&apos;s foothold in the Kursk region is considered a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations. Despite the high losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Russia&apos;s sabotage groups are trying to gain a foothold and have increased the number of attacks in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 26 on national television. Prokudin&apos;s statement comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops carried out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. &quot;We are observing an increase in enemy activity. We understand the places where enemy airborne groups can land, and the (Ukrainian) Defense Forces are ready to destroy them,&quot; Prokudin said. Attacks are &quot;not rare,&quot; and Russian soldiers are trying to gain a foothold on the western bank of the Dnipro regularly, according to the governor. However, none of these attempts have been successful, he added. Russian diversionary groups are trying to gain a foothold on the islands near Kherson or on the western bank of the river every day, Prokudin said, adding that &quot;all the diversionists were eliminated.&quot; The Russian military has been trying to advance on Kozatsky Island, Velykyi Potemkin Island, and the southern island of Zabych in recent weeks, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Dec. 24. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, pushing Russian troops to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19. Public willingness to support Ukraine &quot;until it wins&quot; has dropped significantly across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K., according to a YouGov poll reported by The Guardian on Dec. 26. The survey, conducted between Dec. 3-18, highlights growing skepticism about prolonged support for Kyiv as the war with Russia drags on. In Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K., support for Ukraine&apos;s victory remains relatively high at 50%, 40%, and 36%, respectively. However, these figures represent notable declines from January levels of 57%, 51%, and 50%. Meanwhile, the share of respondents favoring a negotiated peace has risen &#x2014; reaching 55% in Italy, 46% in Spain, 45% in Germany, and 43% in France &#x2014; up by eight-10 points in each country over the year. While many respondents across Western Europe oppose a settlement requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, there is widespread concern that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may reduce or withdraw American support for Ukraine after his inauguration on Jan. 20. Notably, in France, Germany, and Sweden, the percentage of people hoping for Ukraine&#x2019;s outright victory has remained stable since early 2023, though overall willingness to continue support until victory has declined elsewhere. In Poland, a CBOS poll on Dec. 17 showed a dramatic shift in public opinion, with 55% of respondents favoring an end to the conflict even if it means Ukraine ceding territory &#x2014; a sharp rise from 39% in September 2024 and 26% in April 2022. Support for Ukraine fighting without concessions has dropped to 31%, compared to 46% in September and 59% in April 2022. The contrasting attitudes underscore Ukraine&apos;s challenges as it braces for renewed Russian offensives and continued pressure from some Western quarters for negotiations. These changes in public sentiment could complicate Kyiv&apos;s efforts to sustain international backing in its defense against Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-hits-ballistic-missile-propellant-plant-in-rostov-oblast-north-korean-troops-in-kursk-oblast-endure-heavy-losses/	2024-12-26T11:48:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Iranian President Pezeshkian plans to visit Moscow in January	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is going to visit Moscow on Jan. 17, the Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported on Dec. 26, citing Kazem Jalali, the Iranian Ambassador to Russia. Ties between Moscow and Tehran have deepened since the outbreak of the full-scale war in Ukraine in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukraine as well as close-range ballistic missiles. Pezeshkian will hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 17, Jalali said. During the visit, the two leaders are expected to sign an agreement on cooperation between Tehran and Moscow. The new bilateral agreement is intended to replace the 20-year strategic one signed between the two countries in 2001 and extended in 2020. Putin and Pezeshkian first met on Oct. 11 in Turkmenistan. The meeting occurred during an international forum to which the leaders of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan were invited, among others. Following another meeting between Putin and Pezeshkian in Kazan in late October, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the new agreements must &quot;formalize the parties&apos; commitment to close defense cooperation and interaction in the interests of regional and global peace and security.&quot; Pezeshkian won Iran&apos;s runoff election in July earlier this year, defeating hard-liner Saeed Jalili. Internationally recognized monitors were not present to verify the results or guarantee the election&apos;s fairness. The runoff election was triggered by the death of former President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister in a helicopter crash in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/iranian-president-pezeshkian-plans-to-visit-moscow-on-jan-17/	2024-12-26T11:13:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2172434112.jpg
Russia detains 4 suspects allegedly planning to assassinate top defense officials	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained four Russians who allegedly were preparing a series of terrorist attacks against high-ranking Defense Ministry officials and their families, the agency&apos;s press service said on Dec. 26. The statement comes after the high-profile assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov in Moscow on Dec. 17. Kirillov, 54, served as the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense unit. He was killed with a bomb attached to a scooter. According to the FSB, four Russian detainees were involved in an alleged Ukrainian plot to assassinate senior military officers. They now face life imprisonment. One of the suspects is a Russian citizen who allegedly has been living in Ukraine since 2020. In November 2024, he arrived in Moscow via Moldova and Georgia as a deportee. He is suspected to have placed an explosive device disguised as a power bank under the service car of a senior official in the Russian Defense Ministry. The driver of the official was an alleged close relative of the detainee. Another high-ranking Russian military officer was the target of a plot involving a bomb hidden in a folder with documents. The documents were to be delivered by two Russians on the instructions of Ukrainian special services, the statement read. The FSB also detained a resident of Moscow suspected of surveilling the home and workplace of high-ranking Russian Defense Ministry officials and their family members. The suspect allegedly sent photos and videos to his handlers in Ukrainian special services. Improvised explosive devices and communication equipment were seized from the four detainees, the FSB claimed. The suspects have been charged with illegal trafficking in explosives, preparation for a terrorist attack, and high treason. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Ukraine usually does not comment on such arrests by the Russian FSB. Russian law enforcement agencies on Dec. 18 arrested a suspect in the Kirillov assassination, a citizen of Uzbekistan, who claimed to have been recruited by Ukrainian special services. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) previously claimed responsibility for the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/fsb-detains-four-russians-allegedly-preparing-assassination-attempts-on-russian-officials/	2024-12-26T10:41:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1249615636.jpg
Russia declares state of emergency due to oil spill in Kerch Strait	Russia has declared a federal state of emergency in response to an ongoing oil spill in the Kerch Strait, Russian Emergency Situations Minister Aleksandr Kurenkov announced on Dec. 26. The crisis began when two Russian oil tankers, Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239, suffered severe damage during a storm on Dec. 15. Both vessels were reportedly carrying about 4,000 tons of fuel, which began leaking into the Black Sea. &quot;I propose to classify the emergency situation caused by the tanker wreck in the Kerch Strait as an emergency situation of a federal nature and establish a federal level of response,&quot; Kurenkov said on Dec. 26. Russian state funds will now be directed to the emergency response and cleanup effort. Some 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil have spilled into the Kerch Strait, according to the Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti. Russian scientist Viktor Danilov-Danilyan said in a press conference on Dec. 25 that about 200,000 tons of soil along the Black Sea coast have been contaminated. The Kerch Strait separates mainland Russia from Russian-occupied Crimea. Greenpeace Ukraine warned on Dec. 16 that the destruction of the Russian oil tankers could cause &quot;significant&quot; environmental damage. &quot;Any oil or petrochemical spill in these waters has the potential to be serious,&quot; the head of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, Dr. Paul Johnston, said in a statement. In October, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers pose significant environmental risks, as these vessels increase the danger of oil spills. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has caused massive environmental damage, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farm land.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-declares-state-of-emergency-due-to-oil-spill-in-kerch-strait/	2024-12-26T10:14:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1556050975.jpg
Lukashenko seeks to deploy 10 Russian Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko plans to deploy 10 Russian Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus, pro-Kremlin journalist Alexander Yunashev reported on his Telegram channel Yunashev Live on Dec. 26. The &quot;Oreshnik&quot; is an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that Russia touts as an experimental weapon capable of bypassing advanced air defense systems. &#xA0; Answering Yunashev&apos;s question during the Eurasian Economic Union summit, Lukashenko said he expects 10 missile systems from Russia. &quot;If the Russians want to deploy more, we will deploy more,&quot; he added. Lukashenko previously asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to deploy Oreshnik missile systems in Belarus during the signing ceremony of new agreements between Russia and Belarus in early December. Putin responded that such a deployment was &quot;possible&quot; and said the missiles could be supplied to Belarus by the second half of 2025. The Oreshnik is likely not a new Russian development at all, Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. The weapon appears to be a modification of the RS-26 missile, also known as the Rubezh. &quot;I think basically they (Russians) just took apart the RS-26 or just cannibalized it and then put together this new missile with a couple of upgrades and a new paint job,&quot; Hoffman said. First produced in 2011, and successfully tested in 2012, the Rubezh is a 36,000 kilogram, nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile with a known range of 5,800 kilometers. While Putin has claimed that Russia is planning mass production of the Oreshnik, a U.S. official told The Kyiv Independent that Moscow likely possesses &quot;only a handful&quot; of these experimental missiles. Russia launched the Oreshnik missile against Ukraine following Kyiv&apos;s first successful use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles on a military target in Russia. Moscow later acknowledged additional ATACMS strikes on targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-seeks-to-deploy-10-russian-oreshnik-missile-systems-in-belarus/	2024-12-26T09:38:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179663468.jpg
Historian Marci Shore: Putin’s obsession with denazification is ‘Freudian projection’	The return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to political life has raised uncomfortable questions about the future, not only within the U.S. but also on the global stage. This is particularly true for countries like Ukraine, which relies on U.S. aid as it&#x2019;s locked in a battle for survival against Russia&apos;s campaign of total annihilation. Trump&apos;s history of fostering a rapport with Russian leader Vladimir Putin only adds a layer of uncertainty to an already volatile geopolitical landscape. Amid this backdrop, many wonder how we arrived at this point. Intellectuals&#x2019; role has never been more essential &#x2014; or more fraught &#x2014; in exposing how history is manipulated to incite war and how, in such a climate, the ghosts of past tragedies risk being ignored. The persistent banality of evil and the ceaseless tide of daily tragedies challenge our ability to make sense of the modern world. The Kyiv Independent spoke with U.S. historian Marci Shore about a number of topics related to Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, including national trauma, guilt, dehumanization, and totalitarianism. Historian Marci Shore on March 18, 2019. (Jind&#x159;ich Nosek (NoJin) / Wikimedia)This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: There seems to be an unprecedented disconnect between words and their meanings these days. Donald Trump was labeled a fascist by numerous respected officials, yet for his supporters, it was more of a gleeful provocation. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin distorts history by framing his genocidal war in Ukraine as &quot;denazification,&quot; desecrating the Soviet army&#x2019;s legacy &#x2014; a victory shaped in part by Ukrainians. This erosion of meaning reflects a broader crisis: when language becomes unmoored from truth, it is weaponized to manipulate rather than illuminate. What is sustaining this dissonance? Marci Shore: Let&#x2019;s disentangle a few different issues. One is about how we use concepts, analogies, and categories like &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; or &#x201C;concentration camps.&#x201D; These are essentially hermeneutic devices that help us mediate between the singular and the universal. No two historical situations are ever exactly alike, just like no two human beings are ever exactly alike. But these concepts &#x2014; like Kantian concepts &#x2014; help us to process and interpret disparate data. When I used the term &#x201C;fascist&#x201D; to describe Trump in 2016, most Americans found it overly hysterical. In the intervening eight years a lot us &#x2014; historians, philosophers, social scientists &#x2014; put in a lot of work to try to introduce this concept and its history into American consciousness. What has been heartbreaking is to see that, on the one hand, this effort was successful: the fascist elements of Trump&#x2019;s persona and movement are now much better understood as such. On the other hand, it seems that an overwhelmingly large number of American voters do not consider fascism a bad thing at all. Unfortunately, &#x201C;gleeful provocation&#x201D; is in fact a good description. So needless to say, &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not sure how much we&#x2019;ve accomplished. With respect to &#x201C;denazification,&#x201D; there are at least two big conceptual things going on. One is Freudian projection, which is sometimes called &#x201C;accusation in a mirror:&#x201D; the perpetrators&#x2019; projection of their own qualities onto the victims. That&#x2019;s fairly straightforward, so to speak. The phenomenon of post-truth, the unhinging of any even presumed connection between language claims and empirical reality, is much more complicated. This is why I tend to describe Putin&#x2019;s regime as &#x201C;neo-totalitarian,&#x201D; because I do think there&#x2019;s an important conceptual distinction between the absolutist truth claims made by the 20th-century totalitarian ideologies and the postmodern break from even any pretense of being constrained by empirical reality that we&#x2019;re seeing in Trumpism and Putinism.

(Rebecca Droke/AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: At the same time, it&#x2019;s striking how some words appear to unnerve people &#x2014; namely, the Russian opposition&#x2019;s hesitancy around the word &#x201C;guilt.&#x201D; For example, Ilya Yashin, on one of his live streams, talked about how he&apos;s not a prosecutor and therefore has &#x201C;no right&#x201D; to tell people that they are guilty of Russia&#x2019;s war (or Putin&#x2019;s war, as he calls it). Do you think we&#x2019;ll ever see Russian society have serious &#x2014; and necessary &#x2014; discussions about the varying degrees of collective accountability, as the Germans did after World War II? Marci Shore: I want to begin with a philosophical distinction between guilt and responsibility. Guilt is a posteriori &#x2013; that is, it is &#x201C;after the fact,&#x201D; so to speak: a person is guilty of something he or she did or failed to do. Guilt is contingent and depends upon choices and actions. But not-guilty does not mean not-responsible. Responsibility, I would argue, is not contingent. It is a priori; it precedes our choices or actions. We always already bear responsibility &#x2013; it is not dependent on anything we have or have not done. The source of this responsibility is not personal guilt; the source of this responsibility is being in the world. With respect to Vergangenheitsbew&#xE4;ltigung (&#x201C;Dealing with the past&#x201D; in German), I think the Germans &#x2014; to generalize &#x2014; have conflated guilt with responsibility. They have largely accepted inherited guilt for the past but continue, it seems to me, to fail to take responsibility in the present. I don&#x2019;t actually believe in inherited guilt &#x2014; I don&#x2019;t think we are guilty of what our parents or grandparents or ancestors did in times past. I do, though, believe that we are all responsible for looking at what they did with eyes wide open, telling the truth, and working to repair the consequences in the present. With respect to Russia, I agree very much with the Russian novelist Sergei Lebedev that a failure to face the truth of past crimes is a crucial source of what Ukrainian author Volodymyr Rafeyenko described to me as the &#x201C;anthropological catastrophe&#x201D; of Russian society. I think it is connected to a failure of subjectivity, a failure to take hold of oneself as a responsible agent, &#xA0;a subject as opposed to an object. The Russians alive today are not guilty of Stalinist crimes &#x2014; with very few remaining exceptions, those who are guilty are no longer living. But Russians today are responsible for looking at those crimes honestly and telling the truth about them &#x2014; and they have, by and large, failed in that. It&#x2019;s admittedly not an easy task &#x2014; unlike for Germans looking back at Nazism, for Russians looking back at Stalinism, there is no clear dividing line between victim and oppressor. To have lived under Stalinism was both to have been victimized by it and to have been implicated in it. Tetyana Ogarkova has a brilliant line about this: &#x201C;In a liberal society, everyone has a skeleton in the closet, but in a totalitarian society, everyone has a corpse at home.&#x201D; In their joint essay in the recent special issue of Irish Pages devoted to the war, Ogarkova and Volodymyr Yermolenko write about Russia as a place with &#x201C;crime without punishment and punishment without crime.&#x201D; The society is divided into these gangster oligarch-types enjoying total impunity &#x2013; and the masses of people who can be taken away and imprisoned or killed for nothing at all. There&#x2019;s a key here to the crisis of subjectivity in Russia. In both cases, no one is really a responsible agent &#x2014; it&#x2019;s all &#xDC;bermenschian untouchability or helplessness in the face of arbitrariness. An additional distinction is important: between inherited guilt and collective guilt. I do think that collective guilt is real but much more difficult to talk about and parse than individual guilt. Hannah Arendt writes in &#x201C;Organized Guilt and Universal Responsibility&#x201D; that &#x201C;When all are guilty, nobody in the last analysis can be judged.&#x201D; In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Vladimir Kara-Murza referenced just this line by Arendt, explaining that for him, to assign all Russians guilt for war crimes is essentially to assign guilt to no one. I sense what he meant was that the moral risk of saying all Russians are guilty is that it is effectively saying that it doesn&#x2019;t matter what one does or what one chooses.

(Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)When, during the first Trump administration, American border guards were taking refugee children away from their parents on the U.S.-Mexican border and throwing them in cages, I knew that I, too, was implicated. I wasn&#x2019;t silent, of course; I spoke out and protested, etc. However, even so, I am part of this society, and I failed to stop it. When we learned the election results on the night of Nov. 5-6, I thought to myself: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t and can&#x2019;t expect the world to ever forgive us for this.&#x201D; And I think a lot about what I would do if I were Russian, how brave I would or wouldn&#x2019;t be. And I think a lot about what the German philosopher Karl Jaspers wrote about the war, &#x201C;That I live after such a thing has happened weighs upon me as indelible guilt.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent: From a historian&#x2019;s perspective, what insights do past traumas like the Holocaust or Soviet purges offer us in these dark times? Is there something we&#x2019;re missing? Marci Shore: Nothing goes away. Silence doesn&#x2019;t make anything disappear. National mythology will always veer toward falsehood: there have been no such people or nations who have been innocent since time eternal. My desperate hope for Ukrainian society is that despite and through all the trauma, there will be a time after victory where there will be a rebuilding &#x2013; and that rebuilding will take place on a foundation of truth, that a new generation will not be afraid to look as well at Ukraine&#x2019;s own past with eyes wide open, that Ukraine will not find itself decades from now in the state of being that much of Israeli society under (Benjamin) Netanyahu finds itself in. (Ukrainian writer) Victoria Amelina, not long before she was murdered by a Russian missile in Kramatorsk, wrote a short essay called &#x201C;Nothing Bad Has Ever Happened.&#x201D; She wrote about her native Lviv and about the denial that anything bad had ever happened in her own country &#x2014; she found the denial alienating: a home would only be a home when the ghosts, too, were invited for breakfast. I think of it (the essay) as a gift that Vika left for us, a point of departure for a relationship to the past and to ourselves built on truth. The Kyiv Independent: There is a renewed push to reform Slavic Studies since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine. In your view, what will be some of the most pressing questions for future scholars of Ukraine, Russia, and the surrounding region? Marci Shore: There are so many pressing questions in so many different fields. Perhaps some of the obvious ones at the moment: what can we learn from studying the comparative development of civil society in, say, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia, Georgia, etc. post-1991? There&#x2019;s Masha Gessen&#x2019;s implicit question in &#x201C;The Future is History:&#x201D; Why did Bolotnaya (protests in Moscow) fail? Why were they not able to do in Russia what Ukrainians were able to do on the Maidan two years later? What can we learn by trying on different lenses and different prisms? I was just at a workshop called &#x201C;Dilemma&#x201D; in Yerevan centered around the Black Sea as a focal point for identity. How can Russophone literature be reconceptualized in its multinational layers? The developing field of environmental history is wide open. How can we understand Russian imperialism in terms of both its continuities and discontinuities across time and its similarities and differences with other imperialisms across space? How did it happen that in the case of Russia and Ukraine, subjectivity emerged precisely on the part of the colonized and not the colonizers? I would add that we are still struggling to grasp the Soviet experiment. It was arguably the largest, grandest, most penetrating, and far-reaching social engineering experiment ever performed on mankind. We are still grappling with the sheer scale of that experiment and the sheer scale of the catastrophe.

(Stringer / AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: From countless videos filmed on cell phones to drone footage and recorded testimonies, the war in Ukraine is truly the most documented in our history. Yet, the gravity of events like the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and subsequent flooding of Kherson Oblast seems to have passed a lot of people by. I was wondering if, as someone who works with archives and testimonies, you had advice for people not to get lost in this sea of information. Marci Shore: This is a huge problem, and there are multiple aspects. One is just sheer volume: no one can process this much information in real time. We&#x2019;re all deluged and overwhelmed, and just triaging the information takes a lot of energy. This does not necessarily imply any bad faith or ill will at all &#x2014; it&#x2019;s just a question of volume. How much do you and I know about the atrocities taking place in Sudan? It&#x2019;s impossible to pay attention to every place and everyone who deserves our attention. The second problem does involve ill will and bad faith, and that&#x2019;s the problem we can describe as post-truth or disinformation. Peter Pomerantsev makes a point very clearly in the introduction to &#x201C;This is Not Propaganda&#x201D; that I&#x2019;ve been preoccupied with as well: in communist times, truth was actively suppressed. And dissidents were willing to risk their lives to speak the truth &#x2014; with the faith that truth itself had a power. Now the problem is not that truth is suppressed, but that truth is drowned out in the floods composed of truth, post-truth, lies, trivialities, distractions. I wish I had a decisive antidote for this. The best I&#x2019;ve been able to do for myself is follow certain sources &#x2014; publications, journalists, and individuals I trust. The Kyiv Independent: How might people&#x2019;s understanding of democracy, freedom, and resilience evolve because of Ukraine&#x2019;s fight against Russian aggression? Do you think it will prompt people &#x2014; or does it already &#x2014; to reconsider their understanding of national identity, colonial struggles, and other similar issues? Marci Shore: I have many more hopes than I do predictions. I fantasize that the world will survive and we will see a time &#x201C;after the victory&#x201D; when Ukraine is rebuilt not to &#x201C;catch up&#x201D; with the West, but to be the new avant-garde: rebuilt to rely on clean energy, to embrace a cosmopolitan civic identity, to reject national mythology in favor of critical truths. I can also say that for me what this war has laid bare is not so much a new understanding of democracy &#x2014; as we&#x2019;ve just seen in the U.S., democracy is not a guarantee against tyranny. Democracy and liberalism are not the same thing. People can democratically choose fascism. For me what the war has laid bare above all are questions about good and evil, and returning to those categories, to that ontological distinction. The Kyiv Independent: I&#x2019;ve always disliked the term &#x201C;Orcs&#x201D; for Russian soldiers &#x2014; not out of sympathy, but because it is an attempt to distance their actions from the reality that people are capable of committing horrific crimes. The nearly 150,000 war crimes were committed in Ukraine not only by violent criminals but those who had so-called ordinary lives before the full-scale war. Do you think the othering of the enemy, in this case, is a sort of coping mechanism for a world that refuses to accept that peace is not a given? Marci Shore: These are the classic questions. I tend to believe that the demographic of hard-core sadistic psychopaths is marginal, although grossly overrepresented in positions of power. But there are not enough sadistic psychopaths to carry out mass atrocity on this scale without massive participation by those Christopher Browning famously called &#x201C;ordinary men.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s not clear to me that our understanding has progressed dramatically beyond what we read in Christopher Browning&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ordinary Men&#x201D; and Arendt&#x2019;s &#x201C;Eichmann in Jerusalem&#x201D; and Slavenka Drakulic&#x2019;s &#x201C;They Would Never Hurt a Fly,&#x201D; the latter of which is a series of portraits of Yugoslav war criminals from the 1990s. Drakulic, who herself is from what was Yugoslavia and is now Croatia, went to the Hague and listened to these war crimes trials. And like Arendt listening to Eichmann, Slavenka was listening in her own language, there was an intimacy there. We have Stanley Milgram&#x2019;s study from the 1960s, which I still teach &#x2014; I don&#x2019;t know that we&#x2019;ve gotten much further. I remember being an undergraduate at Stanford and hearing my first lecture about the Milgram study. And I remember that the professor giving the lecture said to us, &#x201C;If you listen to all this and think: I would never have given any electric shocks, then you&#x2019;ve missed the point.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/historian-marci-shore-putins-obsession-with-denazification-is-freudian-projection/	2024-12-26T09:36:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2151587755-1.jpg
Russia closes all 4 Moscow airports for unspecified 'safety' concerns	Russia temporarily suspended flights at all four airports operating in Moscow on Dec. 26, citing safety concerns, the Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) announced. A fifth airport in Kaluga was also closed. &quot;To ensure the safety of civil aircraft flights, temporary restrictions have been introduced on the operation of Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, Vnukovo, Zhukovsky and Kaluga airports,&quot; Rosaviatsiya said on Dec. 26. The agency did not specify the cause of the security concerns. All airports were reopened after temporary closure. Moscow has previously shut down its airports amid drone strikes over the region. Ukraine launched its largest drone attack against Moscow in November 2024. The latest announcement comes as Russian air defense operations are under scrutiny due to the crash of an Azerbaijani Airlines plane in Kazakhstan on Dec. 25. The crash was reportedly caused by a Russian air defense missile, according to a preliminary investigation. The missile allegedly targeted Flight 8432 during drone activity over Grozny.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-closes-all-4-moscow-airports-for-unspecified-safety-concerns/	2024-12-26T09:18:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1243734669-1.jpg
Increase in enemy activity' — governor on Russia's assaults in Kherson Oblast	Russia&apos;s sabotage groups are trying to gain a foothold and have increased the number of attacks in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 26 on national television. Prokudin&apos;s statement comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops carried out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. &quot;We are observing an increase in enemy activity. We understand the places where enemy airborne groups can land, and the (Ukrainian) Defense Forces are ready to destroy them,&quot; Prokudin said. Attacks are &quot;not rare,&quot; and Russian soldiers are trying to gain a foothold on the western bank of the Dnipro regularly, according to the governor. However, none of these attempts have been successful, he added. Russian diversionary groups are trying to gain a foothold on the islands near Kherson or on the western bank of the river every day, Prokudin said, adding that &quot;all the diversionists were eliminated.&quot; The Russian military has been trying to advance on Kozatsky Island, Velykyi Potemkin Island, and the southern island of Zabych in recent weeks, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Dec. 24. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, pushing Russian troops to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-observing-increase-in-enemy-activity-governor-on-russias-assaults-in-kherson-oblast/	2024-12-26T08:34:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2149869538.jpg
Thailand accepts Russia's invitation to join BRICS	Thailand has accepted Russia&apos;s invitation to become a BRICS partner state, Thai Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nikondet Phalangkun said at a press briefing on Dec. 26. BRICS, composed of Russia, China, India, Brazil, and other nations, is a bloc of emerging economies often portrayed as a counterweight to the Western-led world. &quot;On October 31, Thailand received an invitation to become a BRICS partner state from Russia, the group&apos;s chair in 2024,&quot; Phalangkun said. &quot;On December 24, the Cabinet of Ministers held a meeting and decided that Thailand would respond positively to the invitation.&quot; The government believes that joining the economic alliance will carry benefits for Thailand across a number of sectors. &quot;(M)embership in BRICS will benefit Thailand by promoting trade, investment, food and energy security,&quot; Phalangkun said. Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted a BRICS forum in Kazan in October 2024. According to Moscow, 36 world leaders participated in the summit. Following the event, Putin said that invitations would be sent to a number of proposed new partner countries. Four new members &#x2013; Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates &#x2013; joined BRICS at the start of 2024. This marked the group&apos;s first expansion since December 2010, when South Africa became a member. Thailand opted to remain neutral after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Bangkok did not impose sanctions on Moscow or send weapons to Kyiv, but did later vote in favor of multiple United Nations resolutions calling for Russia&apos;s withdrawal from Ukraine. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/thailand-accepts-russias-invitation-to-join-brics/	2024-12-26T08:19:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157382812.jpg
18 Russian soldiers allegedly killed in Ukraine's Dec. 25 attack in Kursk Oblast, military says	Ukrainian troops hit a Russian command post in the town of Lgov in Kursk Oblast, allegedly killing 18 Russian soldiers, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications reported on Dec. 26. Ukrainian forces reportedly hit the command post of Russia&apos;s 810th Separate Marine Brigade, located in an abandoned civilian building in Lgov, overnight on Dec. 25. Following the attack, Kursk Oblast Acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein claimed that Ukraine attacked civilian facilities and infrastructure in Lgov, killing four people and injuring five others. The strike killed 18 personnel and partially destroyed the command post, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications claimed in a Dec. 26 statement. A deputy brigade commander was most likely among the killed, and most of the killed soldiers were staff officers. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops, who have been fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. Despite the high losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Ukraine&apos;s foothold in Kursk is considered a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/18-russian-soldiers-allegedly-killed-in-ukraines-dec-25-attack-in-kursk-oblast-military-says/	2024-12-26T07:27:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2151581445-1.jpg
Russian shadow fleet tanker likely caused damage to undersea power cable, Finland says	Recent damage to the Estlink 2 power cable in the Gulf of Finland was likely caused by a Russian tanker believed to be a part of Moscow&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; Finnish police announced in a press conference on Dec. 26. The Estlink 2, a 170-kilometer (106-mile) undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia, was reported to be seriously damaged on Christmas Day. Authorities are investigating the incident as a possible act of sabotage. The anchor of the Russian vessel Eagle S appears to have caused the damage to the cable, authorities said, according to the Finnish media outlet Yle. The Eagle S was detained in Finnish territorial waters and investigators are gathering evidence and conducting interviews with the crew ahead of an expected trial. The ship likely belongs to Russia&apos;s shadow fleet, a group of vessels employed to help the Kremlin evade sanctions, Finnish customs officials said. Investigators are still working to determine whether the damage was accidental or deliberate sabotage. The Estlink 2 has remained offline since the incident and repair to the cable could take months, threatening the power supply in the winter season. The Finnish and Estonian governments are holding emergency meetings to assess the situation. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said that Helsinki has not been in contact with Moscow. &quot;The government is doing everything it can to address the issue,&quot; Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said. &quot;The shadow fleet is also a major risk to other Baltic littoral states and the rest of the EU.&quot; Orpo said Russia&apos;s ongoing war against Ukraine led to the incident. &quot;Shadow ships are pumping money into Russia&apos;s war chest so that Russia can continue its war against Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;These ships are constantly being listed on sanctions lists, and this has already had a major impact.&quot; Nordic countries have been on high alert due to increasing security threats from Russia. European intelligence services warned in 2023 that Russia could be preparing to sabotage power cables, wind turbines, and gas pipes, in Nordic countries. Finland investigated Russia&apos;s possible role in damaging an underwater gas pipeline in fall 2023. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the notion as &quot;complete rubbish.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-likely-caused-damage-to-undersea-power-cable-finland-says/	2024-12-26T07:04:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190806016.jpg
‘Praise is not practice’ – Snyder’s new book challenges America’s understanding of freedom through comparison with Ukraine	In his latest book, &#x201C;On Freedom,&#x201D; American scholar Timothy Snyder establishes a thought-provoking distinction between the word &quot;liberation&quot; and the Ukrainian wartime variant &quot;de-occupation&quot; to probe the fraught but necessary question: When is a person truly free? Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has left countless settlements in ruins and displaced millions. Those who have fled face the uncertainty of carrying on with their lives elsewhere, while those returning to areas liberated by Ukrainian forces, if possible, must rebuild. Snyder describes visiting the village of Yahidne in Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Chernihiv Oblast, where during the occupation, Russian soldiers forced nearly the entire village &#x2014; more than 360 people &#x2014; into the school basement at gunpoint. The locals would spend a month there, in inhumane conditions, used as human shields for the Russian soldiers&#x2019; headquarters upstairs. Eleven of them would not make it out alive. &#x201C;A liberation suggests that a woe has dissipated,&#x201D; Snyder writes. &#x201C;But the adults need support, the children a new school. It is so very important that (the village) is no longer occupied. But it would be wrong to end the story of Yahidne when the survivors emerged from underground.&#x201D; Snyder&#x2019;s concerns are valid &#x2014; although nearly three years have passed since the occupation of Yahidne, Ukrainian journalists have reported on ongoing scandals surrounding the reconstruction of the village that came to be one of the many settlements symbolizing the horrors of Russian aggression. While &#x201C;On Freedom&#x201D; primarily focuses on the United States, Snyder&#x2019;s reflections on Ukraine, enriched by his expertise as a historian of European history and particularly that of the former Soviet Union, make the book a compelling read for a broad audience, offering both a stark warning and a much-needed declaration of moral clarity in an era increasingly defined by rising authoritarianism. There is, first and foremost, a necessity, as Snyder argues, to rescue the word freedom from &#x201C;overuse and abuse.&#x201D; Defining what drives freedom is crucial to understanding the true extent of it. In this context, the comparison Snyder ultimately draws between countries like the U.S. and Ukraine is striking. Snyder suggests that we can conceive of freedom in two ways: as freedom from something or as freedom to do something. The former, the cornerstone of American identity &#x2014; originally freedom from British tyranny &#x2014; presents a vision many Americans believe is assured by birthright. It is what he also calls &#x201C;negative freedom:&#x201D; the absence of occupation, oppression, or even government. Yet, Snyder warns, this belief in freedom from something is vulnerable to malevolent distortion. Those in power can easily mislead the public into forfeiting their rights by disguising the act as a safeguard against both tangible and perceived threats, such as the expanded surveillance abilities of law enforcement after the 9/11 terrorist attacks during U.S. President George W. Bush&#x2019;s administration. A woman faces the door with the calendar and names of the people who died in the basement of the school where Russian occupiers held more than 300 residents, including 77 children, captive from March 3 to 30, 2022, in Yahidne, Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine, on Jan. 17, 2024. (Kirill Chubotin / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Snyder contends that symbols like the American flag, seen as emblems of freedom, can sometimes also substitute for the actual practice of it. History offers many instances where the freedoms these symbols represent excluded certain groups, with racial inequality in the U.S. serving as a recurring example throughout the book. True freedom, Snyder argues, is not rooted in endlessly glorifying past achievements but in the courage to confront what must be done to uphold and expand freedom for all. As he aptly states, &#x201C;praise is not practice.&#x201D; &#x201C;It is easy to imagine that freedom will be brought to us by a song, by jets over a stadium, by the land, by the ancestors, by the Founders, by capitalism,&#x201D; he continues. &#x201C;But is the notion that we are granted freedom right for a &#x2018;home of the brave&#x2019;?&#x201D; &#x201C;Is it not more courageous to ask what Americans have done, could have done, should do?&#x201D; The Cold War offers us a telling example. As Snyder notes, it was a &#x201C;moral challenge&#x201D; for the U.S. &#x2014; Senator Joseph McCarthy launched a witch hunt for communist influence in the country, destroying many innocent people&#x2019;s lives and careers with baseless accusations. The U.S. government also supported right-wing dictatorships in Latin America to suppress even moderate socialist movements. At the same time, &#x201D;the Soviet challenge had also pushed America toward some strengths,&#x201D; including a manned mission to the moon, substantial investments in education, and the promotion of cultural diplomacy abroad. While not without flaws, U.S. policy during the Cold War demonstrated a commitment to investing in its population and protecting it through robust structures. This approach helped to underscore the perceived superiority of the American model over that of the USSR. &#x201C;Whether we will be free will depend on us,&#x201D; as Snyder writes. &#x201C;Not just on what we do, but on why we do it: our ideals.&#x201D; The genocidal nature of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &#x2014; marked by the deliberate destruction of cultural sites and the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children &#x2014; might have some think that Ukraine&apos;s struggle is simply the fight for freedom from Russia. Yet, the Ukrainians that Snyder speaks with during his visits to the wartime country tell him about freedom in a fundamentally different way than Americans perceive it. Their viewpoint aligns with most other countries, to be more precise &#x2014; and this is what makes all of them happier, healthier, and ultimately more well off. For Ukrainians, the war is not framed as only a fight for freedom from Russia but rather about the freedom to live on their own terms. This vision of freedom is one rooted in self-determination, where Ukrainians strive for autonomy and the right to shape their own future without Russian interference or domination. &#x201C;The occupiers had gotten in the way of a sense that the world was opening up (for Ukrainians), that the next generation would have a better life, that decisions made now would matter in years to come,&#x201D; Snyder writes. Ukrainian military veteran Viacheslav Rybachuk, whose brother, a Ukrainian soldier Oleksiy, was killed in the Bakhmut area in 2023, kneels down at a designated area for commemorating fallen Ukrainian and foreign fighters during the Independence Day of Ukraine in the Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine on Aug. 24, 2024. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;A soldier in a rehabilitation center told me that freedom was about everyone having a chance to fulfill their own purposes after the war. A veteran awaiting a prosthesis said that freedom would be a smile on his son&#x2019;s face. A young soldier on leave said that freedom was about the children he would like to have.&#x201D; Snyder also explores how access to knowledge and an openness to engage meaningfully with the world around us are integral to a free society &#x2014; ideals that countries like Russia actively seek to undermine. He highlights how Ukraine has had to confront Russia&#x2019;s attempts to manipulate global perceptions of the war through contradictory narratives, such as claims that the Ukrainian language is &#x201C;not real&#x201D; while also alleging that Ukrainians are &#x201C;forced&#x201D; to speak it over Russian, or the paradoxical assertions that Ukraine is a country of Nazis but also one that promotes LGBTQ+ values and is involved in some sort of Jewish conspiracy. As Snyder writes, &#x201C;the simple fact that Russia had invaded a neighboring country got lost on social media,&#x201D; with online platforms becoming battlegrounds for narratives debating whether the invasion was &#x201C;justified.&#x201D; He critiques this distraction, noting, &#x201C;Americans and others wasted outrage on phantoms even as a real war of aggression began.&#x201D; Reading Snyder&apos;s &quot;On Freedom&quot; evokes an even more somber undertone in the aftermath of Donald Trump&apos;s 2024 presidential victory in the U.S., which was marked by his repeated assertions that there &quot;wouldn&apos;t be a country anymore&quot; if he lost &#x2014; a mantra designed to incite fear among his base and sway undecided voters. While conservative pundits tout the &quot;future looks bright&quot; for the country, others voice growing concerns over potential erosions of freedoms, including minority rights and women&apos;s health, given the declarations Trump and his allies made on the campaign trail. Simultaneously, Russia appears emboldened amid uncertainty over the future of U.S. military aid for Kyiv, escalating aerial assaults across the country and intensifying efforts to occupy more territory in Ukraine&#x2019;s east. Ukrainian officials also face mounting pressure to agree on negotiations for a ceasefire, all while recognizing that Moscow&#x2019;s ultimate goal of exterminating the Ukrainian national idea remains unchanged. The prospects for 2025 and beyond may appear grim, yet Snyder encourages readers to remain steadfast and resolute: &#x201C;Fear is not enough. It will not get us where we need to go. From the most basic facts we can build a scaffolding of hope.&#x201D; By grounding ourselves in fundamental moral truths rather than intoxicating ourselves with dangerous rhetoric, we can begin to construct not just resistance against authoritarian forces but a framework of hope and substantive action to better the world. Engaging with sometimes uncomfortable inquiries about oneself, one&#x2019;s community, and one&apos;s country is not merely an intellectual exercise but a necessity for genuine clarity and self-awareness. This act of reclaiming agency &#x2014; choosing hope over fear &#x2014; is itself a crucial step toward safeguarding freedom. Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this article.

Azerbaijani government sources claim Russian missile caused plane crash over Kazakhstan, Euronews reports	A Russian surface-to-air missile caused the crash of the Azerbaijan Airlines flight near Aktau, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijani government sources reportedly confirmed to Euronews on Dec. 26. The plane, en route from Baku to Grozny, carried 67 passengers, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty-eight people have been confirmed dead. The missile allegedly targeted Flight 8432 during drone activity over Grozny on Dec. 25. According to Euronews sources, shrapnel from the explosion reportedly struck the passengers and cabin crew as the missile detonated mid-flight near the aircraft. The reported use of air defense systems aligns with multiple media reports of drone attacks in Chechnya on the morning of Dec. 25. The aircraft attempted to land in Grozny, but Russian airports reportedly denied it permission for an emergency landing, forcing the pilots to divert toward Aktau in Kazakhstan. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Footage analyzed by independent media outlets Meduza and Mediazona shows damage consistent with surface-to-air missile impacts, including holes in the fuselage and traces of a missile strike on the tail section. Survivors recounted hearing an explosion before the failed landing attempts in Grozny. Upon trying to land in Aktau, the plane broke apart on impact and caught fire. Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially attributed the crash to a collision with a flock of birds, causing the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. The black box from the crash site has been recovered, and Azerbaijani media reported that its analysis will be critical in confirming the events leading up to the crash.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijan-airlines-crash-in-kazakhstan-allegedly-linked-to-russian-missile-strike-euronews-reports/	2024-12-26T05:46:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749786.jpg
North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast endure heavy losses, logistical struggles, Ukrainian military intelligence says	North Korean troops deployed in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast continue to suffer significant losses, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 26. Russia has stationed approximately 12,000 North Korean soldiers in the region since August to assist in ousting Ukrainian forces. On Dec. 20, Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka reportedly inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean troops. HUR confirmed the destruction of a North Korean mortar unit, with additional losses recorded at multiple sites. Despite sanitary losses, including five soldiers on Dec. 20 alone, Russian officers ordered the units to maintain their positions. HUR also reported severe logistical issues for North Korean units on the front lines, including a lack of drinking water due to active hostilities. However, Russian forces have continued supplying these troops with ammunition and food to sustain their positions and resume assault operations. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 23 that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or injured since their deployment in Kursk Oblast. Their casualties have been linked to their inexperience with the terrain and modern drone warfare, according to South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon. While North Korean forces have proven vulnerable to Ukrainian drone strikes, their presence has enabled Russian troops to make limited gains in the region, recapturing some territory previously held by Ukrainian forces. The use of North Korean troops in ground assaults marks an escalation of their involvement in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, raising concerns about Moscow&#x2019;s growing reliance on Pyongyang for military support.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-in-kursk-oblast-face-heavy-losses-logistical-struggles-hur-reports/	2024-12-26T05:37:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Willingness to support Ukraine 'until it wins' drops significantly in Western Europe, poll says	Public willingness to support Ukraine &#x201C;until it wins&#x201D; has dropped significantly across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K., according to a YouGov poll reported by The Guardian on Dec. 26. The survey, conducted between Dec. 3-18, highlights growing skepticism about prolonged support for Kyiv as the war with Russia drags on. In Sweden, Denmark, and the U.K., support for Ukraine&#x2019;s victory remains relatively high at 50%, 40%, and 36%, respectively. However, these figures represent notable declines from January levels of 57%, 51%, and 50%. Meanwhile, the share of respondents favoring a negotiated peace has risen &#x2014; reaching 55% in Italy, 46% in Spain, 45% in Germany, and 43% in France &#x2014; up by eight-10 points in each country over the year. While many respondents across Western Europe oppose a settlement requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, there is widespread concern that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may reduce or withdraw American support for Ukraine after his inauguration on Jan. 20. Notably, in France, Germany, and Sweden, the percentage of people hoping for Ukraine&#x2019;s outright victory has remained stable since early 2023, though overall willingness to continue support until victory has declined elsewhere. In Poland, a CBOS poll on Dec. 17 showed a dramatic shift in public opinion, with 55% of respondents favoring an end to the conflict even if it means Ukraine ceding territory &#x2014; a sharp rise from 39% in September 2024 and 26% in April 2022. Support for Ukraine fighting without concessions has dropped to 31%, compared to 46% in September and 59% in April 2022. The contrasting attitudes underscore Ukraine&apos;s challenges as it braces for renewed Russian offensives and continued pressure from some Western quarters for negotiations. These changes in public sentiment could complicate Kyiv&#x2019;s efforts to sustain international backing in its defense against Russian aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/willingness-to-support-ukraine-until-it-wins-drops-significantly-in-western-europe-poll-says/	2024-12-26T04:39:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-486250819.jpg
Polish PM Tusk slams Hungary’s Orban for praising Putin amid Ukraine attacks	Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk criticized Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for calling Vladimir Putin Hungary&apos;s &#x201C;honest partner&#x201D; during Russia&#x2019;s massive missile attacks on Ukraine on Christmas Day, according to a Dec. 26 statement on X. Russia launched 78 missiles and 106 drones on Dec. 25, striking multiple Ukrainian cities. Kharkiv faced &#x201C;massive fire&#x201D; from ballistic missiles, injuring six, according to local authorities. Tusk highlighted the contrast between Orban&#x2019;s remarks and the reality of the attacks, saying, &#x201C;On Christmas Eve, Russia launched a massive missile attack on Ukrainian cities. At the same time, in a Christmas interview, Prime Minister Orban called Putin an honest partner of the Hungarians.&#x201D; Orban&#x2019;s remarks highlight Hungary&apos;s ongoing ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Hungary has frequently opposed EU sanctions on Russia and blocked military aid to Ukraine. On Dec. 16, Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry denounced Hungary&#x2019;s &quot;peacekeeping&quot; rhetoric as manipulative, accusing Orban&#x2019;s government of advocating for Ukraine&#x2019;s surrender and obstructing international efforts to support Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-tusk-slams-hungarys-orban-for-praising-putin-amid-ukraine-attacks/	2024-12-26T03:39:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2119755509.jpg
Ukraine hits ballistic missile propellant plant in Rostov Oblast, Stratcom reports	The Ukrainian Air Force struck a plant in Kamensk-Shakhtynsky, Rostov Oblast, that produces solid propellant for ballistic missiles, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) reported on Dec. 26. These missiles are reportedly used to attack civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, including hospitals, residential buildings, and power plants. &#x201C;This strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the capabilities of the Russian armed forces to carry out terrorist attacks against Ukrainian civilians,&#x201D; Stratcom said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The attack is one of several recent strikes in Rostov Oblast. On Dec. 25, Ukrainian long-range drones targeted an ammunition depot at the Kadamovsky military training ground, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told The Kyiv Independent. On Dec. 24, drones struck the military airbase in Millerovo, according to local acting governor Yury Slyusar. Earlier, on Dec. 19, Ukraine&#x2019;s Navy and the SBU carried out a combined strike on the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov Oblast. These operations are part of Ukraine&#x2019;s broader efforts to disrupt Russia&#x2019;s military supply chain and hinder its ability to conduct attacks on Ukrainian cities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-ballistic-missile-propellant-plant-in-rostov-oblast-stratcom-reports/	2024-12-26T03:04:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165947283.jpg
Russian drone attack on central Nikopol market injures 6, officials report	Russian forces struck the central market in Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, with a drone on Dec. 26, injuring six people, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. Those injured, four women and two men, received first aid from rescuers and medics before being transported to the hospital. Governor Serhii Lysak confirmed the injuries and said three women, aged 39, 63, and 64, are in serious condition. &#x201C;They are are being provided with all the necessary medical care,&#x201D; he said. The attack caused significant damage to commercial premises, according to emergency responders. This assault follows a Dec. 24 strike on a residential building in Kryvyi Rih, also in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The Christmas Eve attack injured at least 15 people and killed one, according to Lysak.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-on-central-nikopol-market-injures-6-officials-report/	2024-12-26T01:44:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-26_09-53-45.jpg
Russian luxury market thrives despite sanctions through shadow networks, FT reports	Russian shoppers continue to access luxury Western brands despite sanctions imposed after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, The Financial Times reported on Dec. 26. An industry of personal buyers, resellers, and cross-border smugglers has emerged, allowing affluent Russians to circumvent restrictions. The European Union has limited legal sales of luxury goods to Russia to items priced under 300 euros ($312), far below the typical cost of high-end fashion. Customs records reportedly reveal that trade is being diverted through intermediaries in countries where such sanctions do not apply. In September, over 300 Italian-made Bottega Veneta handbags, averaging $1,800 each, were shipped from Dubai to Russia by a Chinese reseller. Western designer brands remain accessible in Russia, with Moscow retail consultancy IBC Real Estate noting that half of the major brands present in 2020 are still introducing new collections. Some businesses have adjusted their offerings to avoid falling under sanctions. The sanctions have fueled a boom in intermediary services. A personal buyer in Italy told The Financial Times that he sends 10 to 20 packages weekly to Russia, earning up to 6,000 euros ($6,238) in commissions. Latvian customs officials reported rejecting 60 shipments of luxury goods with suspiciously low declared values since the beginning of the year. Intermediaries often disguise shipments as personal purchases by removing tags or altering packaging. These practices carry risks for Western companies, which can be held liable for export violations if their products reach Russia. BMW announced on Dec. 23 that it had dismissed employees involved in exporting over 100 luxury cars from Germany to Russian buyers in violation of sanctions. A Russian oligarch also illegally imported a $110 million Airbus A320neo from the EU, defying sanctions, The Moscow Times reported earlier this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-luxury-market-thrives-despite-sanctions-through-shadow-networks-ft-reports/	2024-12-26T01:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Russia's inflation hits year-high, driven by war spending, food price hikes, Rosstat says	Inflation in Russia has reached its highest levels in nearly a year, driven by war spending and rising food prices, The Moscow Times reported on Dec. 25, citing Russia&apos;s Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat). To curb accelerating inflation fueled by war expenditures, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has raised its interest rate from 7.5% in July 2023 to the current 21% &#x2014; the highest level since the early 2000s. Consumer prices rose 0.33% during the week of Dec. 17-23, pushing year-to-date inflation to 9.5%, surpassing the 2022 annual rate of 7.4%. Annual inflation now stands at 9.7%, with food prices surging by 11.41% &#x2014; the steepest increase since October 2022. Essential goods have seen dramatic price hikes since the start of the year, including potatoes (90.5%), onions (46.6%), cabbage (46.6%), and butter (35%). The Central Bank&#x2019;s aggressive interest rate hikes have drawn criticism, particularly from Russia&#x2019;s military-industrial complex. Sergei Chemezov, CEO of state-owned defense giant Rostec, warned in October that continued rate increases could bankrupt businesses. However, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina maintains that the high rate is essential to curb inflation, a view echoed by opposition politician Vladimir Milov. Milov told the Kyiv Independent in November, &#x201C;Chemezov is right that businesses will have to shut down at such a high rate. Nabiullina is right that the rate cannot be cut because... there will be hyperinflation like in Turkey.&#x201D; The Central Bank is expected to reassess the feasibility of further rate hikes in its next meeting as it struggles to balance inflation control with economic stability. Rising costs of basic goods, coupled with internal economic pressures from the war, highlight the financial challenges Russia faces under its strained war economy.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-inflation-hits-year-high-driven-by-war-spending-food-price-hikes-rosstat-says/	2024-12-26T00:45:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2155642507.jpg
Russian companies increasingly using Bitcoin amid sanctions, Reuters reports	Russian companies are increasingly using Bitcoin and other digital currencies for international payments in response to Western sanctions, Reuters reported on Dec. 25. Once key facilitators of Russia&#x2019;s trade, Chinese banks have significantly curtailed transactions over fears of losing access to U.S. financial markets. By mid-2024, roughly 80% of Russian payments in Chinese yuan were reportedly rejected or returned. The shift follows legislative changes in Russia allowing cryptocurrencies in foreign trade to counter the impact of sanctions. Moscow has embraced cryptocurrencies, including legalizing Bitcoin mining. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed during a Russia-24 interview that domestically mined Bitcoin is now being used in foreign trade under an experimental framework. &#x201C;Such transactions are already occurring,&#x201D; Siluanov said, emphasizing that digital currencies could become a key tool in international payments. Sanctions have heavily restricted Russia&#x2019;s access to traditional financial markets. Both the U.S. and the EU banned the export of dollars and euros to Russia in March 2022, reducing their use in trade. Chinese yuan initially filled the gap, becoming the most traded foreign currency in Russia. However, expanded U.S. sanctions targeting financial institutions doing business with Russia have further constrained payment options. Russia and China have reportedly discussed barter-based trade as another mechanism to navigate sanctions-related payment challenges, Reuters reported earlier in August.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-turns-to-cryptocurrency-for-international-trade-amid-sanctions/	2024-12-25T23:45:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1384895902.jpg
Biden directs Pentagon to 'continue its surge' of weapons deliveries to Ukraine after Russia's Christmas attack	U.S. President Joe Biden directed the Pentagon to &quot;continue its surge&quot; of weapons deliveries to Ukraine in response to Russia&apos;s mass attack on the country on Christmas Day, he announced on Dec. 25. Russia launched 78 missiles and 106 drones on Dec. 25, striking multiple cities and causing damage. Kharkiv endured &quot;massive fire&quot; from ballistic missiles, leaving six injured, according to local authorities. Biden condemned the attacks and pledged continued support for Ukraine until it defeats Russian aggression. &#x201C;The Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and safety,&#x201D; Biden said. He added that hundreds of air defense missiles have already been sent to Ukraine in recent months, with additional deliveries underway. Biden reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses. &#x201C;The United States will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s position in its defense against Russian forces,&#x201D; he said. The strikes on Dec. 25 caused significant damage, prompting emergency blackouts in several Oblasts of Ukraine. Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, confirmed that Russian strikes severely damaged equipment at thermal power plants, though the locations were not disclosed. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s nominee for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, also criticized the assault, calling Christmas a &#x201C;time of peace.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-directs-pentagon-to-continue-its-surge-of-weapons-deliveries-to-ukraine-after-russias-christmas-attack/	2024-12-25T23:22:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg

Zelensky wishes Ukrainians peace and unity in third wartime Christmas address	President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his Christmas Eve address on Dec. 24 that Ukrainians continue to hold on to their faith, unity, and traditions during the third Christmas in wartime. Zelensky highlighted the cultural importance of Mykola Leontovych&apos;s &quot;Shchedryk,&quot; written in Pokrovsk, and its global association with the spirit of Christmas. &quot;Let everyone who hears it remember Ukraine, how we are fighting for the main symbol of this holiday &#x2013; for hope and victory,&quot; he said. &#x201C;This is our third Christmas during the war,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote. &#x201C;We cannot celebrate it fully &#x2013; not everyone is at home, not everyone has a home, and not everyone is with us.&#x201D; &#x201C;All we need is to live peacefully on our land, to see the sun, our sky, and in it &#x2013; the Christmas star, not Iranian drones and Russian missiles. The president called for prayers for soldiers, prisoners, and those in occupied territories, adding, &quot;Wherever we are today, we are together. As one big family, as one united nation.&quot; He concluded by wishing for peace, justice, and joy for all Ukrainians. &quot;We fight and pray for this. And we deserve it.&quot; Russia launched a mass aerial attack against Ukraine on Dec. 25, targeting cities across the country with missiles and drones.

Ukraine war latest: Russian air defense may have downed Azerbaijani plane, media say	Key developments on Dec. 25: The Azerbaijani Airlines plane that crashed on Dec. 25 en route to Russia may have been shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile, according to reports from independent Russian media outlets. The aircraft, carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic, crashed near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty eight people have perished in the crash, according to the latest information. The potential use of air defense systems aligns with several media reports according to which Chechnya was attacked by drones on the morning of Dec. 25. Footage of the plane shows traces of a large surface-to-air missile impact on the tail section of the plane, according to Russian independent media outlet Meduza. Similar-looking holes in the fuselage have reportedly been documented in numerous images and videos of military and civilian aircraft downed by surface-to-air missiles. Survivors recalled hearing an explosion after failed landing attempts in Grozny, according to the independent Russian outlet Mediazona. The plane then turned back, crossing the Caspian Sea toward Kazakhstan. Upon attempting to land at Aktau Airport, it broke apart on impact and caught fire. Meduza and Mediazona also cited Russian pro-war Telegram channels which showed photographs of the crash that suggested the plane had been shot at. Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially claimed that the plane collided with a flock of birds, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. During the maneuver, the aircraft &quot;hit the ground.&quot; The black box has been recovered from the crash site, Azerbaijani media reported. Its analysis is expected to provide critical insights into the events leading up to the crash. Russia launched a mass aerial attack against Ukraine on Dec. 25, targeting cities across the country with missiles and drones. The northeastern city of Kharkiv was among the hardest hit, coming under &quot;massive fire&quot; from ballistic missiles, according to local authorities. At least six people were injured, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Explosions were also reported in Dnipro, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, and the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk. A missile was also shot down over Chernivtsi Oblast, located in the West of Ukraine along the border with Romania and Moldova, Governor Ruslan Zaparanyuk reported. There were no casualties. Russia launched 78 missiles and 106 drones, the Air Force said. Ukraine shot down 55 Kh-101/Kh-55/Kalibr cruise missiles and four Kh-59/Kh-69 missiles, as well as 54 Shahed-type drones and other types of drones, according to the report. Another 52 drones were &quot;lost.&quot; &quot;Every Russian massive strike takes time to prepare. It is never a spontaneous decision. It is a conscious choice not only of targets but also of time and date,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Multiple cities in Ukraine imposed emergency blackouts following the attack. Ukrainian long-range drones attacked an ammunition depot at the Kadamovsky military training ground in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast in recent days, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 25. The Kadamovsky training ground, located near Novocherkassk in Rostov Oblast, is one of the largest in Russia. &#xA0;According to the source, the ammunition depot was completely destroyed by drones operated by the SBU. &quot;It was used by the enemy to supply its troops in the Kramatorsk sector (in Donetsk Oblast),&quot; the source said. &quot;Now the Russians have significant logistical difficulties, which significantly affect their ability to conduct combat operations.&quot;The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. This is the latest of several attacks on Rostov Oblast reported over the past week. Ukrainian drones targeted the city of Millerovo, which hosts a military airbase, overnight on Dec. 24, said Yury Slyusar, the local acting governor. Ukraine&apos;s Navy and the SBU also carried out a combined strike against the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov Oblast on Dec. 19. Ukrainian-made Shchedryk unmanned aerial vehicle has been approved for military use, the Defense Ministry announced on Dec. 25. The Shchedryk aerial vehicle consists of a control station and remotely piloted aircraft with silent electric motors. It has increased resistance to electronic warfare and can be tasked with monitoring the actions of Russian troops on the battlefield, according to the ministry. Shchedryk can operate both day and night and perform tasks when there is strong wind, frost, or heat. &quot;The capabilities of the aerial vehicle and its optical equipment allow it to operate from an altitude that is difficult to reach for most enemy air defense systems,&quot; Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov said. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale war with Russia. Ukraine has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Ukrainian troops hit the command post of the 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade in the town of Lgov in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast overnight on Dec. 25, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications reported. The Russian command post was located in an abandoned civilian building, the military claimed. &quot;This fire strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the ability of the Russian Armed Forces to coordinate military operations against the people of Ukraine,&quot; the statement read. According to Alexander Khinshtein, the acting governor of &#xA0;Kursk Oblast, Ukraine attacked civilian facilities and infrastructure in Lgov, killing four people and injuring five others. Russian Telegram channels shared videos purporting to show a damaged high-rise building and cars. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. In August, Kursk Oblast became the scene of intense fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops when Kyiv captured dozens of settlements. A senior General Staff official told Reuters in late November that Ukraine had lost over 40% of the territory it previously captured in Kursk Oblast. Russia reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops. In late December, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the number of killed and injured North Korean soldiers has surpassed 3,000. Japan is poised to allocate an additional $3 billion dollars from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Dec. 25. In a phone call with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Zelensky expressed his gratitude for Japan&apos;s previous aid to Ukraine, which has totaled $12 billion and &quot;makes it possible to save thousands of lives.&quot; &quot;I told Prime Minister Ishiba about Russia&apos;s massive shelling of Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure on Christmas night and thanked Japan for its readiness to work toward achieving a just and lasting peace as soon as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine received $1 billion from Japan and the U.K. through the World Bank&#x2019;s Growth Foundations Development Policy Loan (DPL) program on Dec. 24. The funds are intended for use in the social and humanitarian spheres.Zelensky also met with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya during his visit to Kyiv back in mid-November. The two reportedly discussed Japan&apos;s growing concern over the reported presence of North Korean troops on the front line in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Iwaya further underscored Japan&apos;s commitment to deepening its relationship with Ukraine, highlighting plans to expand economic cooperation and implement additional sanctions against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-50/	2024-12-25T13:05:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749786.jpg
Kellogg condemns Russia's mass attack against Ukraine on Christmas Day	President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, denounced Russia&apos;s mass attack on early Christmas morning, emphasizing that &quot;Christmas should be a time of peace.&quot; Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, was one of the hardest-hit cities in Russia&apos;s latest mass attack. Explosions were also heard as far west as the city of Ivano-Frankvivsk.&quot;Christmas should be a time of peace, yet Ukraine was brutally attacked on Christmas Day. Launching large-scale missile and drone attacks on the day of the Lord&#x2019;s birth is wrong,&quot; Kellogg wrote on Dec. 25 on X, formerly known as Twitter. &quot;The world is closely watching actions on both sides. The U.S. is more resolved than ever to bring peace to the region.&quot; Kellogg, 80, previously held key roles as executive secretary and chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council under President Trump, and served as a senior advisor to then-Vice President Mike Pence. Ukraine and the U.S. have agreed on a date for Kellogg&apos;s first visit to Kyiv in his capacity as peace envoy. While authorities didn&apos;t announce the specific date for security reasons, it is likely to take place before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to end the war in Ukraine, suggesting he could negotiate a peace agreement that would satisfy both Ukraine and Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/kellogg-condemns-russias-mass-attack-against-ukraine-on-christmas-day/	2024-12-25T12:49:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1247741520.jpg
Russian air defense missile may have downed Azerbaijani plane, media say	The Azerbaijani Airlines plane that crashed on Dec. 25 en route to Russia may have been shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile, according to reports from independent Russian media outlets. The aircraft, carrying passengers from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic, crashed near the coastal city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. There were 67 people on board the aircraft, including 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz citizens. Thirty eight people have perished in the crash, according to the latest information. The potential use of air defense systems aligns with several media reports according to which Chechnya was attacked by drones on the morning of Dec. 25. Footage of the plane shows traces of a large surface-to-air missile impact on the tail section of the plane, according to Russian independent media outlet Meduza. Similar-looking holes in the fuselage have reportedly been documented in numerous images and videos of military and civilian aircraft downed by surface-to-air missiles. Survivors recalled hearing an explosion after failed landing attempts in Grozny, according to the independent Russian outlet Mediazona. The plane then turned back, crossing the Caspian Sea toward Kazakhstan. Upon attempting to land at Aktau Airport, it broke apart on impact and caught fire. Meduza and Mediazona also cited Russian pro-war Telegram channels which showed photographs of the crash that suggested the plane had been shot at. Russia&apos;s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) initially claimed that the plane collided with a flock of birds, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. During the maneuver, the aircraft &quot;hit the ground.&quot; The black box has been recovered from the crash site, Azerbaijani media reported. Its analysis is expected to provide critical insights into the events leading up to the crash.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijani-plane-crash/	2024-12-25T11:55:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190749786.jpg

Former top enlistment officer arrested after trying to flee abroad, investigators say	Yevhen Borysov, a former head of Odesa Oblast&apos;s military enlistment office, was arrested again in Kyiv on Dec. 25 after posting 39 million hryvnia ($931,652) bail and being released from a detention facility, the State Investigation Bureau said. The former official planned to hide from the authorities after his release from detention and flee abroad, the bureau said. In July 2023, Borysov was charged with illicit enrichment and violating military service regulations. The State Investgation Bureau said on Dec. 25 that, in addition to the previous charges, it had charged Borysov with forging documents to show he had sustained a combat injury, which resulted in him being paid additional compensation from April to June 2022, amounting to 165,480 hryvnias ($3,953). As part of the ongoing investigation by the State Bureau of Investigations, a court has transferred to the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA) two properties in the Spanish resort town of Marbella. The assets include a 857-square-meter house valued at 4 million euros and a 223.9-square-meter office worth 510,000 euros. The properties are registered to the former military commander&#x2019;s mother and wife. An investigation published by media outlet Ukrainska Pravda in June 2023 looked into the property acquired by Borysov&apos;s family, which he initially denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/dbr-former-head-of-odesas-military-enlistment-office-caught-likely-planned-to-flee-country/	2024-12-25T08:54:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/dbr-zatrimalo-kolishnogo-odeskogo-vijskkoma-a-jogo-neruhomist-v-italii-peredano-v-arma-1.jpeg
Russia ready to export gas to EU via routes bypassing Ukraine, official claims	Russia is ready to supply natural gas to Europe through alternative routes bypassing Ukraine, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak claimed on Dec. 25 on Russian state-controlled television. The declaration comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed during a press conference on Dec. 19 that Ukraine would not extend the transit agreement for Russian gas through its territory, which is set to expire on Dec. 31. &#x201C;We will not engage in extending the transit of Russian gas. We will not give (Russia) the opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Following Zelensky&apos;s confirmation, EU member states such as Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Austria raised their concerns, with their state-owned energy companies jointly advocating for the continuation of gas transit through Ukraine. Russian officials appear confident in Europe&apos;s reliance upon its natural gas industry. Only earlier this year did the EU finally introduce its first sanctions against Russia&apos;s gas industry, specifically targeting liquefied natural gas (LNG). &quot;In terms of logistics, Russian gas is the most beneficial, as well as in terms of price,&quot; Novak claimed, adding that Europeans have to pay more for American gas amid competition with China. In late August, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia could pursue alternative routes, including a planned gas hub via Turkey, if Kyiv failed to extend the transit deal. Apart from the Ukraine route, Russian gas is transported via the TurkStream pipeline, which crosses the Black Sea. Russia may also potentially ship liquified natural gas (LNG) in tankers. Meanwhile, the Nord Stream gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany has been non-operational since it was blown up in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-ready-to-export-gas-through-routes-other-than-ukraine-official-claims/	2024-12-25T07:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Is Putinism fascism by another name?	The term &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; is increasingly used to describe the agenda and actions of the current Russian state under Russian President Vladimir Putin. Today&#x2019;s use of this label has three dimensions: It is a historical analogy to interpret present events, an expression of Ukraine&apos;s lived experience, and a scholarly classification enabling comparisons with other regimes. Understanding these perspectives sheds light on the ideological and practical dynamics behind Putinism and its impact on Ukraine and beyond. Characterizing Putin&#x2019;s regime as fascist often serves as a diachronic analogy or metaphorical classification to better understand current developments in Russia and its occupied territories. Drawing parallels with historical events helps to highlight key features and challenges in contemporary Russia. Labeling Putin&#x2019;s regime as &#x201C;fascist&#x201D; aims to clarify for the general public the nature of events unfolding in Russia and in Ukrainian territories under its control. This comparison is justified by numerous parallels between Putin&#x2019;s domestic and foreign policies and those of Benito Mussolini&#x2019;s Italy and Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. By late 2024, political, social, ideological, and institutional similarities have accumulated. These range from the increasingly dictatorial and, in some respects, totalitarian characteristics of Putin&#x2019;s regime to the Kremlin&#x2019;s revanchist and genocidal tendencies in its external actions. Historian Timothy Snyder has also noted that Russia&#x2019;s official historical memory and political iconography have, in coded ways, become pro-fascist. In 2018, Snyder highlighted Ivan Ilyin, a right-wing intellectual from the inter- and post-war Russian emigration who admired Mussolini and Hitler. Under Putin, Ilyin has gained renewed prominence. Snyder describes Ilyin&#x2019;s work as providing &#x201C;a metaphysical and moral justification for political totalitarianism&#x201D; and &#x201C;practical outlines for a fascist state.&#x201D; Putin has openly celebrated Ilyin&#x2019;s ideas, and Ilyin&#x2019;s influence is evident in the rhetoric of Russian officials, including Dmitry Medvedev, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church. Putin&#x2019;s invocation of Ilyin was notably explicit in a speech marking the illegal annexation of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts in September 2022. Putin concluded his remarks with an Ilyin quote: &#x201C;If I (Iliyn) consider Russia my Motherland, it means that I love, reflect, and think, sing, and speak in Russian; that I believe in the spiritual strength of the Russian people. Its spirit is my spirit; its destiny is my destiny; its suffering is my sorrow; its flowering is my joy.&#x201D; For Ukrainians, the term &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; functions not only as a historical analogy but also as a verbal expression of collective trauma. Since Russia&apos;s invasion in 2014, Ukrainians have coined the term &#x201C;ruscism&#x201D; (a blend of &quot;Russia&quot; and &quot;fascism,&quot; pronounced &#x201C;rashyzm&#x201D;) to describe the Kremlin&apos;s genocidal campaign against their nation. This neologism captures the shock and despair caused by Russia&apos;s relentless aggression, from airstrikes on civilians to cultural erasure. The terms &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; and &#x201C;ruscism&#x201D; are used by the Ukrainian government and society as rallying cries to mobilize domestic and international support against Russian aggression. These labels are meant to highlight the existential stakes of Russia&apos;s war of extermination for Ukraine. They signify that Russia&apos;s campaign is not merely about territorial conquest. Since 2022, Russia&#x2019;s revanchist ambitions have focused on annihilating Ukraine as an independent nation-state and distinct cultural community. In this, the Kremlin&apos;s words and actions align. Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a New Year&apos;s address to the nation from Rostov-on-Don, Russia, on Dec. 31, 2022. (Mikhail Klimentyev/SPUTNIK/AFP via Getty Images)Even before Feb. 24, 2022, statements by Russian officials, lawmakers, and propagandists suggested that Moscow&#x2019;s goals extended beyond redrawing borders, restoring regional hegemony, or resisting the Westernization of Eastern Europe. Since at least 2014, Russia has ruthlessly targeted Ukrainian national identity, culture, and sentiment. While it would be an overreach to equate Russian Ukrainophobia with the Nazis&apos; biological and eliminatory antisemitism, Moscow&#x2019;s irredentist war aims to destroy Ukraine as a sovereign polity and independent civil society. The Kremlin does not seek to physically annihilate all Ukrainians, as the Nazis did with the Jews. However, its agenda goes far beyond harassment, deportation, and indoctrination. It involves the expropriation, terrorization, imprisonment, torture, and murder of Ukrainians (and some Russians) who resist Russia&#x2019;s military expansion, political repression, and cultural dominance. Given this context, it is unsurprising that many Ukrainians and some Russian observers describe Russia&apos;s actions as &#x201C;fascist.&#x201D; For millions of Ukrainians living under occupation or returning to a war-torn homeland, Moscow&#x2019;s brutality is made manifest through relentless airstrikes, which frequently target civilian infrastructure &#x2014; homes, supermarkets, hospitals, and schools &#x2014; rather than military sites. Military historians might argue that targeting civilians is not unique to fascist warfare. However, for most Ukrainians, the term &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; captures their reality and resonates with their collective memory of historical fascism, particularly German Nazism. For older Ukrainians who lived through World War II and younger who learned about it from their parents or grandparents, the parallels with the Luftwaffe&apos;s air raids on civilian populations, Third Reich&#x2019;s occupation policies, and Nazis&#x2019; anti-Slavic racism are stark. An increasing number of experts on Central and Eastern Europe now describe Putin&apos;s Russia as fascist. However, many comparative historians and political scientists hesitate to use this term due to their narrow definitions of generic fascism. For these scholars, a defining characteristic of fascism is the pursuit of political, social, cultural, and anthropological re- or new birth, rather than restoring a past order. Fascists often mythologize a Golden Age from their nation&#x2019;s distant past but aim to forge a new national community rather than to preserve or revive the currently decaying order. Unlike the revolutionary nature of fascism, Putinism seeks to restore the Tsarist and Soviet empires instead of creating an entirely new Russian state, culture, and identity. For this reason, many comparativists refrain from categorizing Putin&#x2019;s regime as fascist. Nevertheless, Putinism has evolved significantly over the past 25 years. Putin began his political career under pro-Western democrats Anatoly Sobchak and Boris Yeltsin. Early in his presidency, Russia maintained liberal and pro-European elements, and entered the Council of Europe, NATO-Russia Council, and G8. Moscow even negotiated a deepened partnership agreement with the EU until 2014. However, Putin&#x2019;s rise to power in 1999 marked the start of Russia&#x2019;s regression from a proto-democracy to an autocracy. In 2007, during his infamous Munich Security Conference speech, Putin signaled a decisive turn away from the West. Over time, his regime became increasingly illiberal, nationalist, imperialist, and militaristic, with a partial pause during Dmitry Medvedev&#x2019;s palliative presidency. By 2022, Russia&#x2019;s pseudo-federation had shifted from semi-authoritarian to semi-totalitarian, culminating in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and alignment with authoritarian Asian states. The regime&#x2019;s regression has been marked not only by escalating rhetorical aggression, internal repression, external escalation, and political radicalization. Putin and his entourage now routinely threaten to employ nuclear weapons. Russia also implements a kind of agenda in the occupied Ukrainian territories that resembles fascist strategies. In the occupied territories, Russia&#x2019;s russification campaign employs terror, forced reeducation, and material incentives to impose a profound sociocultural transformation. While such revisionist policies are not inherently fascist, the Kremlin&#x2019;s methods and goals &#x2014; turning Ukrainian communities into ideologically standardized cells of a unified &quot;Russian people&quot; &#x2014; share similarities with the attempted fascist revolutions of Mussolini&#x2019;s Italy and Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. Russian imperial ultranationalists view Ukraine as part of &#x201C;New Russia&#x201D; or &#x201C;Little Russia,&#x201D; dismissing Ukrainians as a merely sub-ethnic group of the greater Russian people. In their narrative, Ukrainians have been misled by foreign actors &#x2014; be it the Catholic Church, Imperial Germany, the Bolsheviks, or the West &#x2014; into forming an artificial nation. This irredentist vision portrays Ukrainians as border-dwellers of the Russian empire rather than citizens of an independent state. Moscow&#x2019;s occupation policy seeks to reverse this perceived &#x201C;civilizational split&#x201D; by conducting a rebirth of &quot;Little Russia&quot; within the annexed territories. This involves a political, social, cultural, and anthropological transformation reminiscent of fascist domestic and occupation policies. While population homogenization campaigns are not exclusive to fascism, the Kremlin&#x2019;s russification efforts in Ukraine align closely enough with classical fascist strategies to be considered quasi-fascist. Russian soldiers take part in a parade for Victory Day in Moscow&apos;s Red Square in Moscow, Russia, on May 9, 2023. (Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s current internal situation is still far from full-fledged fascism, as Putin and his circle are no domestic revolutionaries but representatives of the pre-1991 &#x201C;ancien r&#xE9;gime.&#x201D; Rather than forging a novel empire, they aim to restore the Tsarist and Soviet orders as much as possible. In this sense, Putin is less akin to Hitler and more comparable to Germany&#x2019;s last Reich president, Paul von Hindenburg, who enabled Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power by appointing him Reich chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933. Within Russian pan-nationalism, Ukraine is viewed not as a foreign country but as the western frontier of Greater Russia. While most outsiders interpret Moscow&#x2019;s aggressive Ukraine policy as an implementation of Russia&#x2019;s foreign political priorities, many Russians see it as an internal affair. This perception frames the treatment of Ukraine as a family matter, where the norms of international law and humanitarian conventions are deemed irrelevant. For Ukrainian victims and international critics of Russia&#x2019;s actions, the refusal of many scholars to label Putin&#x2019;s regime as fascist can seem inadequate, disingenuous, or even amoral. Russia&#x2019;s forces and occupation authorities in Ukraine &#x2014; particularly since the full-scale invasion of 2022 &#x2014; have engaged in horrendous acts of terrorism, genocide, and sadism. Insisting that these actions are unequivocally and exclusively non-fascist feels jarring in light of atrocities like the mass murders in Bucha and Mariupol, destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, mass deportation of Ukrainian children, routinized torture of the vast majority of Ukrainian prisoners of war, and targeted airstrikes on apartment buildings, universities, and libraries all over Ukraine. These crimes are neither incidental byproducts of military operations nor singular aberrations by local commanders nor standard neocolonial practices. A cautious classification of the ideology behind Russia&#x2019;s war of extermination as merely &#x201C;illiberal,&#x201D; &#x201C;conservative,&#x201D; or &#x201C;traditionalist&#x201D; seems thus grossly insufficient. Many who have studied the harrowing details of Russia&#x2019;s mass terror campaign in Ukraine would find such descriptors misleading. At the same time, reducing Putinism solely to fascism oversimplifies its nature. Explaining Moscow&#x2019;s aggression purely as an outgrowth of ultra-nationalist fanaticism ignores the political pragmatism behind many of its actions. While fascists exist within Russia&#x2019;s political and intellectual elite, most of the country&#x2019;s key policymakers are cynics rather than fanatics. A significant factor in Russia&#x2019;s pre-2022 foreign policy adventures was their perceived ease and reward. Earlier military interventions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria were not only tactically successful but also bolstered Putin&#x2019;s domestic standing. These campaigns stabilized Putin&apos;s rule in Russia&#x2019;s largely conformist society, where victories abroad translated into popular support at home. By early 2022, as Putin&#x2019;s approval ratings were waning again, a repetition of the pattern of previous foreign interventions may have seemed rational given their prior victories on the ground and enthusiastic perception at home. Russia&#x2019;s earlier military ventures had proven politically advantageous, strategically predictable, militarily effective, economically manageable, and widely popular. From this perspective, the decision to escalate in Ukraine reflects not just a murderous ideology but also calculated pragmatism.

Ukraine hits Russian naval infantry brigade command post in Kursk Oblast, military claims	Ukrainian troops hit the command post of the 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade in the town of Lgov in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast overnight on Dec. 25, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications reported. The Russian command post was located in an abandoned civilian building, the military claimed. &quot;This fire strike is part of a comprehensive campaign to weaken the ability of the Russian Armed Forces to coordinate military operations against the people of Ukraine,&quot; the statement read. According to Kursk Oblast acting governor, Alexander Khinshtein, Ukraine attacked civilian facilities and infrastructure in Lgov, killing four people and injuring five others. Russian Telegram channels shared videos purporting to show a damaged high-rise building and cars. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. In August, Kursk Oblast became the scene of intense fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops when Kyiv captured dozens of settlements. A senior General Staff official told Reuters in late November that Ukraine had lost over 40% of the territory it previously captured in Kursk Oblast. Russia reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops. In late December, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the number of killed and injured North Korean soldiers has surpassed 3,000.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-command-post-of-810th-separate-marine-brigade-in-kursk-region/	2024-12-25T03:23:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258245894.jpg
Russian missile enters Moldova’s airspace during mass attack on Ukraine	A Russian missile entered Moldovan airspace during a mass attack on Ukraine on Dec. 25, Moldovan President Maia Sandu confirmed. On Christmas morning, Russia launched more than 70 missiles and over 100 drones, targeting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. At least one person was killed, and six others were injured, local authorities said. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported that one cruise missile was flying towards the western town of Chernivtsi from Moldova. According to Sandu, these attacks &quot;clearly violate international law.&quot; &quot;Moldova condemns these acts and stands in full solidarity with Ukraine,&quot; she said. Monitoring Telegram channels also reported that a Russian missile entered Romania. But the Romanian Defense Ministry said that the violation of the country&apos;s airspace was not confirmed. Poland scrambled fighter jets in response to the Russian missile threat in western Ukraine, the Polish Operational Command reported. Warsaw and Bucharest, NATO members, frequently scramble fighter jets to protect countries&apos; airspace as Russian forces launch large-scale aerial attacks on Ukraine. Yet, they have never been used to destroy missiles or drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-confirms-russian-missile-enters-its-airspace-during-mass-attack-on-ukraine-romania-denies/	2024-12-25T03:15:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2153384608.jpg
Azerbaijani Airlines plane en route to Russia crashes in western Kazakhstan	A plane carrying 67 people from Baku, Azerbaijan to Grozny in Russia&apos;s Chechen Republic crashed near the Kazakh city of Aktau on Dec. 25, Tengrinews media outlet reported. According to Kazakhstan&apos;s Transport Ministry, the plane operated by Azerbaijan Airlines had 37 Azerbaijani passengers, 16 Russians, six Kazakhs, and three Kyrgyz, along with five crew members on board. At least 28 people are believed to have survived, the Kazakh Emergency Situations Ministry said. The number of casualties has not been reported. Russia&apos;s Federal Agency for Air Transport (Rosaviatsiya) reported that, according to preliminary data, the plane collided with a flock of birds and the pilot decided to land at the Aktau airfield, after which the aircraft &quot;hit the ground.&quot; Search and rescue operations at the site are ongoing.	https://kyivindependent.com/azerbaijani-passenger-plane-crashes-over-kazakhstan/	2024-12-25T01:03:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/--------------2024-12-25-102809.png
Russia begins movement near Toretsk, uses military equipment, Kyiv says	Russian troops started using military equipment near the towns of Toretsk and Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Dec. 24. Speaking on national television, Bobovnikova said that fighting with the use of armored combat vehicles, motorcycles and buggies took place in the village of Nelipivka north of Toretsk. &quot;We didn&apos;t see this before, but now the enemy has become more active,&quot; she said. Toretsk and Chasiv Yar have become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. The estimated advance of Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast as of Dec. 23, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)The spokesperson described the situation in Toretsk as &quot;the most difficult.&quot; &quot;The fighting is for every house. And you need to understand that somewhere they (Russia) can advance by one house, and literally the next day we are already taking back this house,&quot; Bobovnikova said. According to the spokesperson, it is difficult to use tanks and armored combat vehicles in both Toretsk and Chasiv Yar because they are &quot;not so effective in urban areas&quot; and difficult to maneuver. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line. Apart from Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine expects Russian forces to launch larger-scale attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-starts-using-military-equipment-near-toretsk-chasiv-yar-kyiv-says/	2024-12-24T23:59:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188573227.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 779,320 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 779,320 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 25. This number includes 1,600 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Russia terrorizes Ukraine with mass missile, drone attack on Christmas morning	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a mass aerial attack against Ukraine on Dec. 25, targeting cities across the country with missiles and drones. The northeastern city of Kharkiv was among the hardes hit, coming under &quot;massive rocket fire&quot; from ballistic missiles, according to local authorities. At least two civilians were injured. Explosions were also reported in Dnipro and Kremenchuk. Multiple cities in Ukraine imposed emergency blackouts amid the attack. The Air Force reported that Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers had taken flight overnight, and later announced that a number of Kalibr cruise missiles had been launched from the Black Sea. A series of explosions were reported in Kharkiv after the Air Force warned of a ballistic missile threat against the city. At least seven missile strikes targeted the city, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. The attacks caused fires and damage to civilian infrastructure, Syniehubov reported. Two people were injured and have been hospitalized. Located only 30 kilometers from the Russian border, Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of the full-scale war. Mayor Ihor Terekhov on Dec. 24 announced that the city had put up holiday decorations and lights for the first time since Russia&apos;s February 2022 invasion. The decorations are &quot;a symbol of (Kharkiv&apos;s) steadfastness,&quot; Terekhov said. The mass attack follows a ballistic missile strike against Kryvyi Rih on Christmas Eve. The missile struck an apartment building in the city, killing one civilian and injuring 15 more. A few days before, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kyiv on Dec. 20, causing fires, casualties, and damage to several foreign embassies. Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukraine&apos;s critical infrastructure have intensified with the onset of winter. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also issued escalating threats in recent days, promising &quot;more destruction&quot; for Ukraine and suggesting that Moscow could launch an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-terrorizes-ukraine-with-mass-missile-drone-attack-on-christmas-morning/	2024-12-24T20:43:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693.jpg
Russia deems record number of organizations 'undesirable' in 2024	The Russian government designated a record 65 organizations as &quot;undesirable&quot; in 2024, according to the independent Russian outlet Verstka. Russia&apos;s law on &quot;undesirable&quot; organizations has existed since 2015. It has been used to target perceived opponents of Russian President Vladimir Putin, including NGOs, independent media outlets, and human rights groups. The Russian Justice Ministry added 65 organizations to the list in 2024, Verstka reported on Dec. 24. From 2015 to 2019, no more than four organizations were added to the &quot;undesirable&quot; per year, according to Verstka&apos;s analysis. The number increased significantly thereafter, with Russia adding 50 organizations to the list in 2023. There are now 187 organizations categorized as &quot;undesirable&quot; by the Russian government. Organizations added to the list in 2024 include the Clooney Foundation for Justice (CFJ), founded by Hollywood actor George Clooney and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and the independent Russian media outlet the Moscow Times. The designation exposes employees and affiliates of the organization to criminal prosecution. Leaders of such organizations can face up to six years in prison, and members risk prison sentences of up to four years. Moscow passed a law in May expanding the list of &quot;undesirable&quot; organizations to include those funded by foreign states. Following a subsequent court case brought by Russian organizations operating outside of the country, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the expanded law violates the European Convention on Human Rights.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-deems-record-number-of-organizations-undesirable-in-2024/	2024-12-24T17:01:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1243385216.jpg
Russian court sentences US citizen to 15 years for alleged espionage	A Russian court on Dec. 24 convicted U.S. citizen Eugene Spector of espionage and sentenced him to 15 years in a high-security prison. Spector, 52, was already serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence for bribery when he was charged with espionage. The Moscow City Court on Dec. 24 added 13 years to Spector&apos;s sentence after convicting him of being a spy in a closed-door trial. His previous charge for bribery was added to this term, bringing his total sentence to 15 years. Spector was also fined 14,116,805 rubles (approximately $140,500), according to the independent Russian outlet Mediazona. Spector in 2020 pled guilty to acting as an intermediary to a bribe. He was accused of mediating bribes for Anastasia Alekseyeva, once an aide to former Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, according to the Russian state news agency TASS. The details of the espionage charges against Spector have not been made public. He was charged with spying in August 2023. Spector was born in Russia but moved to the United States, where he attained citizenship. Many U.S. nationals who have been arrested in Russia are now awaiting trial or serving lengthy sentences. Washington has accused Moscow of orchestrating the detention of U.S. citizens to gain leverage for future prisoner swaps. A number of U.S. citizens, including the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, were released in a historic prisoner swap on Aug. 1, with Russia and several Western countries exchanging a total of 24 detainees. The U.S. State Department has warned Americans against traveling, saying they &quot;may face harassment or detention by Russian security officials.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-sentences-us-citizen-to-15-years-for-alleged-espionage/	2024-12-24T15:34:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2107291847.jpg
Kyiv to simplify procurement of drones, electronic warfare equipment	Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers on Dec. 24 approved a resolution to simplify the procurement of domestically produced drones and electronic warfare (EW) equipment, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced. Umerov&apos;s announcement follows recent changes in the leadership and reporting structure of Ukraine&apos;s drone-buying initiative. The resolution establishes a permanent procedure for the procurement of domestically manufactured drones and EW equipment, Umerov said, ensuring a &quot;faster, more transparent, more efficient&quot; process. Military commanders will now be able to purchase tactical-level drones and EW equipment without complicated bureaucratic approvals, Umerov said. &#xA0; Military units can also enter into preexisting agreements between procurement agencies and the Defense Ministry and Communications Service, Umerov said. This will allow units to access weapons more quickly and at competitive rates. &quot;From now on, the military will be able to plan their needs more effectively, and manufacturers will be able to focus on technological development and scaling up production,&quot; Umerov said. Domestic drone development plays a key role in Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy. Currently, 90% of the drones the military uses on the battlefield are produced in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government in April launched the Brave1 initiative to invest in defense tech companies developing EW and unmanned systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-to-simplify-procurement-of-drones-electronic-warfare-equipment/	2024-12-24T14:43:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2069256477.jpg
Fire damages United Russia party office in Arkhangelsk, official claims	The United Russia party office in the Russian city of Arkhangelsk was targeted in an arson attack, party representative Vladimir Zhgilyov reported on Dec. 24. United Russia is the party of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country&apos;s ruling political faction. The Arkhangelsk office was hit with a Molotov cocktail overnight, Zhgilyov said. The identity of the saboteurs is unkown. Zhgilyov claimed it was the work of an &quot;extremist.&quot; No casualties were reported. The office was storing &quot;humanitarian aid&quot; for Russia&apos;s front-line military personnel and for orphanages in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, according to Zhgilyov. Some of the boxes were destroyed in the fire. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Zhgilyov&apos;s claims. Recent arson attacks in Russia have targeted military enlistment offices, post offices, shopping centers, police cars, and banks, according to the Moscow Times. Partisan groups also regularly carry out acts of sabotage both within Russia and in occupied areas of Ukraine. The National Resistance Center reported on Feb. 27 that Ukrainian resistance activitsts blew up a United Russia party office in occupied Nova Kakhovka.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-damages-united-russia-party-office-in-arkhangelsk-official-claims/	2024-12-24T13:43:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1386751124.jpg
Russia has 'systemic problems' with fleet, Navy spokesperson says after Ursa Major explosion	Russia has &quot;systemic problems&quot; with maintaining its fleet, Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said in a television broadcast on Dec. 24. Pletenchuk&apos;s comments came the day after the Russian cargo ship Ursa Major sank in the Mediterranean Sea following an explosion onboard. The cause of the explosion is not yet known. &quot;(T)hey have systemic problems with maintenance,&quot; Pletenchuk said on air, as reported by Ukrinform. &quot;At least, they should have them, given that such vessels usually have a lot of foreign-made elements, and usually it concerns the engine room.&quot; The explosion aboard Ursa Major reportedly occurred in the ship&apos;s engine rooms just after midday on Dec. 23, causing the vessel to list between Spain and Algeria. Fourteen crew members were rescued from the sinking ship, and two remain missing. Pletenchuk said Russia faces difficulties with both civilian and combat vessels. &quot;The Russians have a systemic problem,&quot; Pletenchuk said. &quot;It is quite expectedly reflected in the general condition of their fleet, regardless of whether the fleet is conventionally civilian or combat. If information cannot be disseminated so quickly and easily with the combat fleet, because it is a more closed structure, then what concerns the conventionally civilian shipping of the Russians is on the surface, and sometimes even below the surface.&quot; Ursa Major was built in 2009 and was placed under sanctions after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, due to its role in supplying cargo to the Russian military. The Russian independent news outlet Meduza, citing OSINT analysts, suggested the ship could be part of a Russian convoy evacuating military equipment from Syria, but this has not been confirmed.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-systemic-problems-with-fleet-navy-spokesperson-says-after-ursa-major-explosion/	2024-12-24T12:50:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/Pletenchuk-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia attempts to seize bridgehead on west bank of Dnipro, potentially for Kherson assault	Key developments on Dec. 24: Russian troops are likely seeking to seize a bridgehead on the western bank of the Dnipro River or one of its islands in order to transfer firepower there, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Dec. 24. Voloshyn&apos;s statement comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops were carrying out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. From the new foothold, Russian forces could fire on Kherson and the Ukrainian military units located in the coastal zone on the western bank of the Dnipro, Voloshyn said. Russian forces conduct five to seven assaults by small infantry groups in this area of the front line every day to &quot;detect weaknesses in Ukrainian defense,&quot; according to the official. &quot;The enemy has launched similar assaults on Kozatsky Island, and for several days in a row, they (Russian forces) have been trying to land on Velykyi Potemkin Island, and before that, they tried to land on the southern island of Zabych,&quot; Voloshyn said, adding that Russia also carried out similar assaults near the Antonivskyi Bridge two weeks ago. These efforts are not an attempt to make &quot;a big assault or force the Dnipro River,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;Such (small) groups do not do this. Much larger forces do this, but it is very difficult to hide them with modern intelligence means,&quot; he added. Even if the information about a possible Russian offensive on Kherson turns out to be true, &quot;it will be fatal for the Russian forces,&quot; Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, head of the internal and information policy department of the Kherson Regional Military Administration, told the media. Meanwhile, if the military warns of such a danger, the local authorities are ready to announce additional evacuations from the city and its neighborhoods, the official said. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, and Russian troops were pushed to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19. Russia attacked a residential building in the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Christmas Eve, Dec. 24, injuring at least 13 people, Governor Serhii Lysak said. One person was killed, according to the governor. Preliminary reports say that a Russian ballistic missile hit a four-story apartment building in the city, according to Mayor Oleksandr Vilkul. Two people were rescued from under the rubble. A 79-years old man, as well as 69- and 72-years-old women are in a moderately severe condition at the hospital, Lysak added. &quot;While the rest of the world celebrates Christmas, Ukrainians continue to suffer from endless Russian attacks. Terrorists do not understand human morality,&quot; said Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. Ukrainian volunteers are developing a larger, and more powerful version of the Trembita missile that can reach Moscow, The Economist reported on Dec. 23. The first designs of the Trembita, named after a Ukrainian alpine horn, were unveiled in 2023. The basic Trembita, developed by Ukrainian engineers, is significantly cheaper than Western or Russian missiles, and operates like the V1 flying bombs used by Germany during World War II. The precise timeline for completing the production of the updated missile version is not yet clear. Meanwhile, the developers have spent a year and a half creating the basic design of the weapon, which usually takes several years, The Economist reported, adding serial production is set to follow the final field tests. The Trembita cruise missile flies at 400 kmh (248 mph) with a range of 200 km (124 miles). One unit costs $3,000, and a 20-30-kilogram warhead is priced at $15,000. One barrier to the rapid development of modern Ukrainian weapons is funding. When the government finances production at the stage where the missile has proven it can fly, manufacturers often must risk their own financial contributions. Ukraine offers private missile manufacturers the same maximum 25% profit margin it gives to drone manufacturers, according to The Economist. A senior security official also told the media outlet that Ukraine is &quot;at least a year away&quot; from producing missiles in the numbers, range, and capabilities that would &quot;seriously threaten Russia.&quot; Long-range domestic weapons are critical to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy. They provide the country&apos;s military with an alternative to Western arms, whose use is often restricted. They also compensate for the lack of artillery ammunition on the battlefield. Almost 100 of Ukraine&apos;s new Peklo missile-drone hybrids have been produced as the weapon entered serial production, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Dec. 16. President Volodymyr Zelenksy previously announced that another Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue), passed tests successfully. Italy&apos;s cabinet approved a decree on Dec. 23 extending the supply of &quot;means, materials, and equipment&quot; to Ukraine through the end of 2025, according to a government statement. The move reinforces Italy&apos;s commitment to supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Italy has delivered 10 military aid packages to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s government. These packages have included advanced systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends. Her stance comes amid questions about the United States&apos; future approach when Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has revealed major shortcomings in manufacturing and procurement within Western defense industries, sparking urgent demands to enhance production capacities. Trump has indicated that U.S. support for NATO countries not meeting their commitments could be reduced and has alluded to the possibility of cutting back aid to Ukraine. As president of the Group of Seven (G7) this year, Italy has consistently led efforts to support Ukraine. The G7 nations have condemned Russia&apos;s aggression, reaffirmed their backing for Kyiv, and committed to a $50 billion loan funded by frozen Russian assets. On Dec. 12, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also called on alliance members to enhance military aid to Ukraine, emphasizing the need to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position ahead of potential peace talks with Russia. The U.S. Defense Department has allocated $253.7 million to Williams International (Williams) through the Defense Production Act (DPA) to increase missile production, part of which will form military assistance programs for Ukraine, the Pentagon reported on Dec. 23. The announcement comes as the Biden administration attempts to increase military aid to Ukraine ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, amid concerns that a future Trump administration would halt weapons shipments before they reach Kyiv. The additional funding will allow Williams to increase engine production capacity to meet the Defense Department&apos;s needs for ramping up the manufacturing of Harpoon, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM), Tomahawk, and other precision strike weapons. This step was taken in accordance with the National Defense Industrial Strategy until 2024, which aims to expand domestic production and ensure sustainable supply chains, the statement read. &quot;This effort is a key component of the DoD&apos;s strategy to accelerate the capacity and fielding of precision strike weapons to deliver cutting-edge capabilities and options to our armed forces,&quot; said Laura Taylor-Kale, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy. Funds for the DPA procurements are allocated under the Indo-Pacific Supplemental Security Appropriations Act of 2024 and Ukraine Supplemental Security Appropriations Act of 2024, which includes increasing the production capacity of critical materials needed to defend against aggression. &quot;This facilitization effort is instrumental for both the Air Force and the Navy&apos;s engine-reliant weapons and is necessary to enable the rapid replenishment of our Nation&apos;s long-range weapons of choice,&quot; the Pentagon said. The U.S. provided more than $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine under the Biden administration. The Biden administration is planning to announce in the coming days its final aid package under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) worth around $1.2 billion, Reuters reported on Dec. 20. The European Union is expected to manufacture around two million artillery shells in 2025, Andrius Kubilius, the newly appointed EU Commissioner for Defense and Space, told Hromadske news outlet. Addressing concerns about whether Europe has sufficient production capacity to boost military support for Ukraine, Kubilius said that only 20-25% of EU-supplied weapons are produced within the bloc, with the remainder purchased from external sources. Kubilius emphasized that increasing arms production in the EU depends on orders from European governments, which are currently insufficient. Without long-term contracts with defense manufacturers, he warned, Europe is unlikely to ramp up weapons and ammunition production for Ukraine in the coming years. &quot;EU budget funds cannot be used to buy weapons for Ukraine. There are numerous restrictions on investing in defense industries outside the EU. However, funds from the European Peace Facility or frozen Russian assets can be utilized for arms procurement,&quot; Kubilius explained. Next year, Ukraine is set to receive approximately 30 billion euros from the EU, Kubilius said, leaving Ukrainian authorities to decide how much of this support will go toward defense. Kubilius said there is also a new mechanism being introduced to integrate Ukraine&apos;s defense industry into the European defense ecosystem. The European Council, in its final communiqu&#xE9; from the summit held on Dec. 18-19, urged EU member states to immediately enhance military aid to Ukraine. Leaders called for faster delivery of air defense systems, ammunition, and missiles, as well as additional training and equipment for new Ukrainian brigades.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-tries-to-seize-bridgehead-on-west-bank-of-dnipro-potentially-for-kherson-assault/	2024-12-24T12:24:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1767735905.jpg
Slavoj Žižek: Ukraine’s fight against Russia Is a metaphysical struggle for survival	To understand recent fears about the possible escalation of Russia&#x2019;s war on Ukraine into a nuclear conflict, we must revisit its beginnings, where the groundwork for this crisis was laid. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and now deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council, articulated the wager underpinning Russia&#x2019;s aggression in early 2023: &#x201C;I believe that NATO would not directly interference in the conflict even in this scenario,&#x201D; Medvedev said, referring to the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons on Ukraine. &#x201C;The demagogues across the ocean and in Europe are not going to die in a nuclear apocalypse.&#x201D; Medvedev&#x2019;s statement assumes a fundamental principle: the full sovereignty of a state depends on its citizens&#x2019; willingness to die for it. In this view, Western societies, consumed by commercialism and hedonism, have abandoned this principle. By contrast, Russian President Vladimir Putin has asserted that true sovereignty requires such a commitment: &#x201C;In order to claim some kind of leadership &#x2014; I am not even talking about global leadership. I mean leadership in any area &#x2014; any country, any people, any ethnic group should ensure their sovereignty,&#x201D; Putin said. &#x201C;Because there is no in-between, no intermediate state: either a country is sovereign, or it is a colony, no matter what the colonies are called.&#x201D; To Putin, Ukraine falls into the latter category &#x2014; a pseudo-entity of a non-existent nation undeserving of sovereignty. This perspective invites an unexpected philosophical parallel. Putin&#x2019;s and Medvedev&#x2019;s rhetoric echoes Hegel&#x2019;s &#x201C;Phenomenology of Spirit,&#x201D; specifically the dialectic of master and servant. In Hegel&#x2019;s framework, when two self-consciousnesses engage in a life-or-death struggle, if both are willing to risk everything, no victor emerges &#x2014; one dies, and the survivor lacks recognition. History and human culture depend on an initial compromise: one side &#x201C;averts its eyes&#x201D; and becomes the servant. Medvedev assumes the &#x201C;decadent, hedonist&#x201D; West will avert its eyes. However, as the Cold War taught us, in a nuclear confrontation, there are no victors &#x2014; both sides perish. The ongoing conflict between Russia and the West thus has profound philosophical dimensions. Anton Alikhanov, governor of the Russian exclave Kaliningrad, recently claimed Immanuel Kant, who lived in the region, has a &#x201C;direct connection&#x201D; to the war in Ukraine. Alikhanov blamed Kant&#x2019;s &#x201C;godlessness and lack of higher values&#x201D; for creating the sociocultural conditions that led to World War I and the current conflict: &#x201C;Today, in 2024, we&#x2019;re bold enough to assert that not only did the First World War begin with the work of Kant, but so did the current conflict in Ukraine. Here in Kaliningrad, we dare to propose &#x2014; although we&#x2019;re actually almost certain of it &#x2014; that it was precisely in Kant&#x2019;s &#x2018;Critique of Pure Reason&#x2019; and his &#x2018;Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals&#x2019;... that the ethical, value-based foundations of the current conflict were established.&#x201D; Alikhanov described Kant as a &#x201C;spiritual creator of the modern West,&#x201D; responsible for ideas such as freedom, the rule of law, liberalism, and the European Union. If Ukraine resists Russia in defense of these values, Kant&#x2019;s philosophy indirectly supports Ukrainian resistance. Such statements, however outlandish, highlight the metaphysical stakes of the war. Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church similarly invoked spiritual rhetoric, dismissing fears of nuclear apocalypse. In a shocking display, Kirill praised Russian scientists for developing &#x201C;incredible weapons&#x201D; and claimed that concern over such issues is &#x201C;not good for spiritual health&#x201D;: &#x201C;We await the Lord Jesus Christ who will come in great glory, destroy evil, and judge all nations.&#x201D; The word &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; should be used here without irony: the ongoing war is not merely a struggle for territorial control or economic power. It is also more than an effort to annihilate a nation, though it carries a clear genocidal dimension &#x2014; not in the literal sense of killing every member of a nation but in depriving survivors of their ethnic identity and assimilating them as Russians. It goes beyond signaling a global geopolitical shift. This is a war of spirit against spirit, pitting two mutually exclusive visions and practices of what it means to be human. Perhaps we should return to Nietzsche, who, in &#x201C;Ecce Homo&#x201D; near the end of the 19th century, offered a grim vision of the next century: &#x201C;For when Truth battles against the lies of millennia there will be shock waves, earthquakes, the transposition of hills and valleys such as the world has never yet imagined even in its dreams. The concept of &#x2018;politics&#x2019; then becomes entirely absorbed into the realm of spiritual warfare. All the mighty worlds of the ancient order of society are blown into space &#x2014; for they are all based on lies: there will be wars the like of which have never been seen on earth before.&#x201D; Before dismissing these lines as obscure brooding, we should note that Alain Badiou, though far from a Nietzschean, arrives at similar conclusions in his booklet &#x201C;The Century.&#x201D; Badiou uses the metaphor of the 20th century as the wounded body of a beast &#x2014; a concept he borrows from Osip Mandelstam&apos;s 1923 poem &#x201C;The Age.&#x201D; The beast of the 19th century lived in relative comfort, lulled by the illusion of steady economic and political progress. But in the 20th century, the beast grew weary of incremental progress, choosing instead to confront history directly, attempting to fulfill the promises of the 19th century through acts of brutal voluntarism. As Friedrich Nietzsche foresaw, this shift gave rise to a new kind of &quot;spiritual warfare&quot;: two unprecedentedly destructive world wars, accompanied by violent revolutions. Yet these upheavals merely wounded the beast, failing to produce the envisioned &quot;New Man.&quot; What, then, follows this distinctive mix of hope and brutal disillusionment that defined the 20th century? In &#x201C;The Will to Power,&#x201D; Nietzsche speculates about the 21st century, predicting &#x201C;the total eclipse of all values&#x201D; alongside the emergence of &#x201C;barbaric nationalistic brotherhoods&#x201D;: &#x201C;Nobody should be surprised when&#x2026; brotherhoods with the aim of robbery and exploitation of the nonbelievers&#x2026; appear the arena of the future.&#x201D; Here we are now, and the irony is that those who call for a return to traditional values are often the most ruthless in their &#x201C;robbery and exploitation of the nonbelievers.&#x201D; We must all be prepared to risk our lives, but the key distinction between Russia and Western Europe lies in their perspectives on death. As we&#x2019;ve seen, Russia claims it does not fear death, believing in a divine power that will redeem its people in the afterlife. In contrast, Western Europe operates with the knowledge that there is no higher guarantee &#x2014; death is simply the end. Our hope rests on the possibility that Russia&#x2019;s proclaimed readiness to die is merely a bluff, part of a strategic fa&#xE7;ade. Yet, even a bluff can have real and dangerous consequences. The only God that seems fitting for our era is one of all-encompassing indifference, a concept that Clarice Lispector captures in her chilling description of such a deity: &#x201C;What still frightened me was that even the unpunishable horror would be generously reabsorbed by the abyss of unending time, by the abyss of unending heights, by the deep abyss of the God: absorbed into the heart of an indifference. So unlike human indifference.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/slavoj-zizek-ukraines-fight-against-russia-is-a-metaphysical-struggle-for-survival/	2024-12-24T11:00:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1240050560.jpg
Ukraine receives first $1 billion as part of US batch of frozen Russian assets profits	Ukraine has received $1 billion from the United States in profits from frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Dec. 24. This is the first tranche of the planned $20 billion that the U.S. intends to provide as part of the G7 initiative. &quot;We are grateful to U.S. partners and the World Bank for this important step towards justice,&quot; Shmyhal added. Shmyhal announced on Dec. 20 that Ukraine is already receiving U.S. funds under the framework of the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan covered by profits from frozen Russian assets. This month, Russian embassy in London have condemned a similar plan of United Kingdom to transfer more than two billion pounds ($2.5 billion) to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, calling it a &quot;fraudulent scheme.&quot; The loans were agreed upon in July by G7 leaders&#x2014;comprising the U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States&#x2014;along with senior European Union officials. The majority of the frozen Russian assets are held in EU countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-first-1b-of-profits-from-frozen-russian-assets-from-the-u-s/	2024-12-24T10:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Narrowly overcoming a pro-Russian comeback, Moldovan President Sandu is facing a tough term ahead	Moldovan President Maia Sandu begins her second term in office on Dec. 24 in unprecedented circumstances. Russian meddling in domestic affairs is widespread, and the Kremlin makes clear their position of not acknowledging Sandu as a legitimate president of her own country. Sandu also begins her term amid an energy crisis sparked by years of dependency on Russian gas. Meanwhile, the U.S. support for Ukraine is not a certainty under the new administration, leaving neighboring Moldova in a precarious position. Sandu&apos;s second term in office will be riddled with diplomatic challenges and little room for error. Leading a parliamentary republic where around 360,000 of its nearly 3 million population lives in a Russian-controlled breakaway region of Transnistria and another 130,000 in the Russian-friendly autonomous region of Gagauzia, Sandu&apos;s presidency was never an easy task. Taking office during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Sandu led the country during the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war against neighboring Ukraine, which saw the relations between Moscow and Chisinau further deteriorate. Sandu was able to steer Moldova toward the EU and open accession talks with the union, together with Ukraine. She now is set to lead the country through an energy crisis and prepare for the upcoming parliamentary elections set for July. In late October, Moldovan police reportedly discovered a network of 140,000 people who received payments from Russia in return for votes against the EU during the country&apos;s referendum on Oct. 20. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (R) shakes hands with Moldovan President Maia Sandu ahead of a meeting at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, on Dec. 10, 2024. (Photo by Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images)The same was the case for a vote for the Kremlin&apos;s preferred presidential candidate, Alexandr Stoianoglo, who lost while garnering a considerable 45% of the votes. The pyramid scheme was coordinated from Moscow with the help of the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, the police said. According to Sandu, Shor&apos;s target was to influence the votes of 300,000 people. Shor rejects wrongdoing. While Stoianoglo conceded, the Kremlin said it won&apos;t acknowledge the results of Moldova&apos;s presidential elections. There&apos;s little doubt that Russia would try it once more. &quot;The priority (for Sandu) should be government and political measures to help (her governing) PAS party win the best score in parliamentary elections,&quot; analyst Sorin Ioni&#x21B;&#x103; from Romanian think tank Expert Forum told the Kyiv Independent. Petru Culeac from the Moldova Development Institute adds that &quot;Russia is not used to losing what it considers its own and will try to take its revenge in the next elections.&quot; &quot;The government needs to destroy Shor&apos;s network, as well as other Russian actors of influence infiltrated in the state. Without this step, the next elections are already compromised,&quot; Culeac said. Alina Radu, from investigative newspaper Ziarul de Gard&#x103;, whose newspaper published investigations on Shor&apos;s network, is also concerned with the citizens who sold their votes. &quot;Someone needs to have started working with those people since yesterday,&quot; she said. She is also keen to learn from Shor&apos;s methods. &quot;He created a network that worked. His representatives called on his behalf to thank everyone who took part in his activities, making people feel important. Many people joined the scheme not out of poverty but out of a need to feel useful.&quot; In addition to security concerns, in order to secure a genuinely pro-European parliament, there is general consensus that Sandu and the governing party PAS need to make major changes. They have to also start working with citizens in the north and the south of the country, including Gagauzia, argue Radu and Culeac. &quot;Despite the fact that Gagauzia is the region in which the EU has invested some of the greatest funds, they keep saying that they don&apos;t feel respected or heard,&quot; Culeac said. &quot;Sandu and PAS need to start communicating with the Gagauz elites and try to involve them in big projects they find interesting.&quot; Culeac added that a dialogue with the Russian-controlled region of Transnistria is needed. Ineffective communication is one of the recurrent themes for which the government gets criticized.

(Peter Dench/Getty Images)&quot;Sandu should not be left on her own, and those from PAS have to get out into the public space more and come with secondary messages,&quot; Romanian historian Armand Go&#x219;u said. But communication should go hand-in-hand with quick economic policies that benefit all members of society, including the most vulnerable, said Culeac. In the week leading up to the presidential runoff, Sandu admitted that she will also reshuffle the government team &#x2014; a kept promise, although many criticised the changes as &quot;cosmetic.&quot; Beyond leadership, there is frustration with the slow pace of the anti-corruption fight and economic stagnation. &quot;People are upset with the excuses used to mask failures in the economy and the judiciary,&quot; Moldovan journalist Mariana Ra&#x21B;&#x103; told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We cannot speak for years about how we are unable to attract investment because of the war next door. Ukraine is at war and has attracted investment.&quot; Having followed the justice system as an investigative journalist for 20 years, Ra&#x21B;&#x103; insists the government needs to speed up the vetting process, which &quot;has become more of a problem than a solution by now&quot; because it disheartens the well-meaning and it enables the corrupt to go even more corrupt before they lose their jobs. The journalist also said Sandu needs to widen her circle of consultants on the judiciary reform &#x2014; &quot;perhaps the problem is not the system but her advisers on the topic.&quot; Other measures Ra&#x21B;&#x103; recommends include &quot;sending good messages to the good people in the system,&quot; give the Anti-Corruption Prosecution the headquarters they have been asking for and ask for results from those leading the anti-corruption fight &#x2014; or replace them. Without these important steps, Moldova may end up with a pro-Russian majority in the next parliament. If that happens, &quot;they will reinstate Russian television, reinstate disinformation,&quot; Radu said. But this could also have military repercussions. Until now, Moldova has been protected by Ukraine and Romania. With a change in the geopolitical direction of the country, &quot;(Russian President Vladimir) Putin will not only come with propaganda experts but also with tanks,&quot; the journalist added. Sandu&apos;s attention will be equally spread between fixing the problems at home and carefully knighting a diplomatic effort to make sure the country maintains the required level of support from Ukraine and the West. The election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president can drastically influence the country&apos;s standing, primarily by shaping the outcome of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine next door. Go&#x219;u said that if Ukraine does not get the support it needs and loses to Russia, Moldova will face tremendous pressure of its own. Despite Trump&apos;s anti-Ukraine rhetoric on the campaign trail, Go&#x219;u is not certain that the new administration will serve Russian interests. &quot;I am convinced that Putin does not find Trump convenient,&quot; he said.

(Julien De Rosa / AFP via Getty Images)On the contrary, the expert enumerated the anti-Kremlin measures Trump took in his first term, including giving Javelins to Kyiv, sanctions against Russia and the strike at Wagner mercenaries in Syria. &quot;Ultimately, he is unpredictable,&quot; Go&#x219;u concluded &#x2014; a line held by most political analysts across the world. Beyond the military scenarios, Moldovan journalist Ra&#x21B;&#x103; said that the U.S. may reduce its financial aid to Moldova. Alina Radu, from Ziarul de Gard&#x103;, too, argues that as a businessman, Trump&apos;s &quot;priorities will be business and income, not human rights&quot; and &quot;Moldova becomes an insignificant figure because you can&apos;t do big business here&quot; with such a small market. Regardless of all challenges, &quot;Sandu has to keep a decent relationship with the new U.S. administration,&quot; Ioni&#x21B;&#x103; said.	https://kyivindependent.com/narrowly-overcoming-a-pro-russian-comeback-moldovan-president-sandu-is-facing-a-tough-term-ahead/	2024-12-24T10:01:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190696508.jpg
Civil partnerships in limbo as LGBTQ+ community seeks equal rights amid war	Editor&apos;s Note: This story was sponsored by Gender Zed, a Ukrainian human rights organization that works with a broad range of issues, including sexual orientation and gender identity, gender equality issues, women&#x2019;s rights, and prevention of HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases. Andrii Kovalenko, 35, and his partner are among many couples torn apart by the war, but their situation comes with an additional challenge. As a same-sex couple, they do not have the same rights in Ukraine as a heterosexual one. After joining the army as a volunteer in the summer, Kovalenko&apos;s partner, whose name he does not disclose for security reasons, has been fighting near Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, in one of the war&#x2019;s hottest spots. In case his loved one is captured, missing, or killed in action, Kovalenko will not be informed, nor will he be allowed to visit him in the hospital in case of injury. Since the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s all-out war, Ukrainians have supported petitions urging authorities to grant equal rights to the LGBTQ+ community. The first petition asked to legalize same-sex marriage, and the second one to back civil partnerships, a legal status that would allow couples to gain a number of administrative rights, such as becoming the primary caregiver in case of a partner&apos;s injury. This status can also be used by heterosexual couples. Neither same-sex marriages nor civil partnerships are currently recognized by Ukrainian law. While the exact number of people who identify themselves as being part of the LGBTQ+ community and joined Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces is unknown, the LGBTQ+ military NGO estimates that between 2% and 7% of those defending Ukraine may be part of the community. Andrii Kovalenko, an actor at the Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Drama Theater in Kyiv, says that the lack of the right to enter into a civil partnership creates many legal obstacles for him and his partner. (Courtesy)According to Kovalenko, the lack of the right to enter into a civil partnership creates many legal obstacles for the couple. &quot;If something happens to us, then any (alternative) document will not make any sense,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Legalizing same-sex marriages would require changes to Ukraine&apos;s constitution, which is prohibited during martial law. Introducing civil partnerships is a much simpler task. President Volodymyr Zelensky had previously tasked the government to look into the possibility of introducing such partnerships. A draft law was registered soon after. &quot;We would like to have marriages with a full package of legal rights,&quot; Kovalenko said. &quot;But if now, during martial law, we cannot change the constitution, it is very hypocritical to continue to restrict rights at the most critical moment of their existence.&quot; While some Ukrainian officials voiced support for civil partnerships, the draft law got stuck in the parliament. Inna Sovsun, a lawmaker from the Holos political faction, submitted a draft law in March 2023 intended to legalize civil partnerships. It has received the support of several parliamentary committees but does not include the key one &#x2014; the Legal Policy Committee. Without its approval, the parliament will not consider the bill. Opposition from a number of key lawmakers remains the biggest obstacle for the bill to pass, although Sovsun told the Kyiv Independent there was some progress. &quot;This is a topic that is very easy to manipulate,&quot; Kovalenko said. If the proposed bill would pass, the status of civil partners would equate to a relationship between close relatives and would not equate to a marriage. The partnership would, thus, provide legal rights to couples in case of injury, death, or administrative hurdles, for example, property rights. Ukrainian servicemen are taking part in the Pride March, organized by the LGBT+ community that is gathering for the first time since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of the country in early 2022, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 16, 2024, amid Russia&apos;s attack on Ukraine (Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images).Such partnerships wouldn&apos;t be restricted to the LGBTQ+ community. Heterosexual couples would also have the option to enter into such agreements. Sofa and Illia, both in their 20s, are not ready to get married but are also eager to consider civil partnerships instead as soon as the opportunity arises. &quot;I understand that, for example, if a missile hits, or he (partner) is drafted to the army, I won&apos;t be a first-degree relative. I won&apos;t be able to go and identify his body,&quot; Sofa told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He won&apos;t be able to go and identify my body,&quot; she added. Sovsun aims to get the job done. She is ready to initiate another bill in an attempt to bypass the conservative committee. The attitude of Ukrainians towards granting LGBTQ+ equal rights has been improving since Russia launched its all-out war in 2022, according to polls. More than 70% support equal rights for LGBTQ+, a spring survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showed. Yet, the number of violations of LGBTQ+ rights has increased this year, according to human rights activists. They face physical violence, online harassment, and hate speech. To counter this, activists are also calling for the adoption of another bill registered in 2021, set to increase responsibility for discrimination and hate crimes. The bill hasn&apos;t been considered by the parliament. People attend the Pride Parade in Kyiv, Ukraine, for the first time since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, on June 16, 2024. (Yan Dobronosov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Choice of valuesAllowing civil partnerships would provide the LGBTQ+ with a number of rights that are now available only to heterosexual couples. Among them is the right to allow the partner to receive the body for burial in case of death. Same-sex couples will have mutual rights and obligations when it comes to property ownership, inheritance, social protection, and rights in case of the death or disappearance of a partner serving in the Armed Forces. The law would not allow such couples to adopt children together or take custody of them. Approval of civil partnerships could also be another way to resist Russia, where the crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights intensified following Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion. The new Russian legislation banned the public expression of LGBTQ+ identity in the country, while &quot;the international LGBTQ+ social movement&quot; was declared to be &quot;an extremist organization.&quot; &quot;It is extremely important for us. Foreigners have asked me about this and said: &apos;Wow, now we understand how you are different from Russia. This would never have happened in Russia&apos;,&quot; Sovsun said. &quot;This is our question of civilizational choice. It is essential for us to prove through actions, not just slogans, that we are part of European civilization. Being part of this space implies respecting and recognizing all people as equals.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/civil-partnerships-in-limbo-as-lgbtq-community-seeks-equal-rights-amid-war/	2024-12-24T09:56:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Gender-Zed_image.jpg
Our readers' questions about the war, answered. Vol. 7	Editor&apos;s note: We asked members of the Kyiv Independent community to share the questions they have about the war. Here&apos;s what they asked and how we answered. Join our community to ask a question in the next round. Our community funds our journalism. Question: I know it&apos;s a big question, but how long do you think Ukraine can continue, realistically, to hold out? Answer: It is indeed a big question that cannot be answered simply. Ukraine&apos;s manpower problem is well-known, and with the increased strain of mobilization on society over 2024, it is getting harder and harder to fix in a timely manner. On top of bringing more people in, more needs to be done to better use and protect the infantry currently serving: through better training, equipment, fortifications, use of drones, and command decisions. Until then, the overstretched state of the Ukrainian army is what leads to these larger and larger weak points that can be exploited by Russia and turned into faster territorial gains. But even more important for the answer to your question is the Russian side: how long they can sustain this intensity of offensive operations and the respective losses they are taking. It&apos;s impossible to give a definitive answer to, and the Russians can always turn to larger-scale forced mobilization of their own, or expand the North Korean contingent. There are signs on the horizon that they can&apos;t go on for too much longer, from the economy to an unsustainable rate of armored vehicle losses, but when Moscow&apos;s tactic of choice remains just throwing bodies at the problem, I wouldn&apos;t count on it. &#x2014; Francis Farrell, reporter Question: Everybody wants to see an end to the conflict, but I think Putin wants to continue. I am sure he wants to erase the sovereign nation Ukraine from the world map. In light of this, why has President Zelensky made a statement suggesting a freeze in current front lines and ceding temporarily-occupied land to Russia? They hope to negotiate a return of land to Ukraine later. This seems to me to be a forlorn act. Answer: I recently wrote an analysis looking exactly at all these scenarios, which goes into a lot more detail than I can here. Zelensky is not pushing for a simple freezing of the war, much the opposite, he is making the strong and true case that Ukraine cannot agree to a simple ceasefire without hard deterrence against a repeat Russian invasion, of which only NATO membership really works as a rock-solid guarantee. The point is, that with the battlefield taking a turn for the worse for Ukraine over this year, and with an incoming Trump administration pretty clear on how they plan to scale back aid or end it completely, Zelensky&apos;s options are few. &#x2014; Francis Farrell, reporter Question: Are we now at the point where ground troops from Ukraine&apos;s allies are needed to finish this war? What are the politics concerning this issue within the EU and with other allies of Ukraine? And could the process of providing on the ground support at least be started with trainers, maintainers and logistical support? What is known about possible direct allied involvement in the war? Answer: Yes, in the absence of NATO membership, the deployment of European boots on the ground could serve as a strong deterrent to a future Russian invasion. Sometimes people call it the Korean scenario. It could be anything from air defense, to training, the placement of a missile deterrence manned by foreigners, or troops deployed into a demilitarized zone along the contact line (this one is unlikely, in my opinion). The point here is not only the physical protection that they could provide, but the show of strength to Russia: Europe is standing up to Moscow, and they are embracing Ukraine in its security architecture for the long term. Now, that all sounds great, but the problem is in the implementation. Discussions have certainly begun between some European states, but turning them into action seems to still be a long way to go, and Ukraine might not have that much time. Of course, there is also a big difference in the circumstances under which this could happen: a) as part of a finished peace plan agreed upon by everyone and backed by Trump (unlikely), b) needing to race to back up Ukraine&apos;s security after nothing more than a shaky ceasefire (more likely), or the most risky scenario, needing to come in and save Ukraine from a Russian leader that sees victory in his grasp and refuses to stop on the battlefield. &#x2014; Francis Farrell, reporter Question: Russia has made a lot of noise over U.S. and U.K. missiles being fired into Russia. Are the missiles that Russia is constantly firing into Ukraine all made in Russia? Answer: No, Russia is not only firing Russian-made missiles into Ukraine. Since the end of 2023, it has also been hitting us with North Korean ballistic KN-23/24 missiles. They can fly over 400 miles and have attacked various parts of Ukraine, including Kyiv. In the fall of 2024, Russia reportedly received Iranian ballistic Fath-360 missiles. They are of shorter range and pose the greatest threat to Ukrainian troops and equipment on the front line and in the near rear. We should also not forget about Iranian Shahed drones, which Russia is using to attack the entire country. As you may have heard, Iran has transferred the technology for assembling these drones to Russia and supplies parts for their assembly. So Russia has made Iranian Shaheds one of the most massively used weapons in its war against Ukraine. Finally, even Russian-made missiles contain imported components such as American chips or European heat and cold cameras. These are purchased by Russian intermediary companies, mostly from Chinese trading firms, and supplied to Russian missile manufacturers. Here&#x2019;s our recent investigation about it. &#x2014; Alisa Yurchenko, investigative reporter Question: Is the Soviet Union&apos;s recreation Putin&apos;s ultimate goal? Is that why Russia attacked Ukraine? Answer: Here I want to refer you to the weekly newsletter I write, &quot;WTF is wrong with Russia?&#x201D;, where I try to explain Russia and why it is the way it is. In short, it&#x2019;s complicated. Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn&#x2019;t believe that the states that were part of the Soviet Union are independent. According to Putin, it&#x2019;s &#x201C;Russia&#x2019;s backyard&#x201D; and it is Russia that has the final say in how those states should act and what they should want. Russians also don&#x2019;t acknowledge the right for states like Ukraine and Belarus to have their own language and culture, basically denying reality. Among them, Ukraine is the most important one to Russia. It defied Russia for years and Putin sees subjugating Kyiv as his ultimate prize. After so many defeats in Ukraine, it&#x2019;s personal for him. Additionally, Putin thinks that&#x2019;s how the world works &#x2014; if you are strong, you can do whatever you want. In Putin&#x2019;s reality, the West had been unfair to Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union and had put Russia on its knees. Now, Russians are getting back at them. That&#x2019;s not true, and Russia had been bailed out by the West on multiple occasions, it was added to the G7 and was provided a seat at all important meetings, but that&#x2019;s not how Russians see things now. &#x2014; Oleksiy Sorokin, deputy chief editor Question: Does Ukraine envisage the West not accepting Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership? If so, what guarantees would be valid for Ukraine to eventually accept peace with Russia? Answer: President Volodymyr Zelensky had said on multiple occasions that NATO membership is the only security guarantee Kyiv will accept. &quot;(Ukraine) needs security guarantees, which we believe NATO membership offers most effectively,&#x201D; he said. However, NATO membership isn&#x2019;t currently on the table for Ukraine and Kyiv is attempting to find alternative security guarantees that would help the country survive. Among them are deploying troops from European countries in Ukraine following a ceasefire. Ukraine is &quot;discussing ideas with European leaders&quot; on the potential deployment of European peacekeeping forces to the embattled country, Zelensky told reporters during a press briefing in Brussels on Dec. 18. Among the countries that were open to such an idea were France, Sweden, Poland, and the U.K. All of these talks are still in their early stages and a top EU official told the Kyiv Independent said there are no discussions currently ongoing at the EU level on sending European troops to Ukraine to enforce a potential ceasefire. &#x2014; Oleksiy Sorokin, deputy chief editor Question: I read about the possibility of letting Russia keep the oblasts they invaded in the last 10 years, and have Ukraine as a NATO member as a security measure. My question is, how do the Ukrainian people feel about this? Do you think it would be fair? Answer: According to a poll published on Dec. 22, 47% of Ukrainians support joining NATO even if some of its territories remain under Russian occupation at the time of accession. Ukrainians are exhausted and my understanding is that most people in the country would take the offer if it involves NATO membership and a ceasefire in which Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t de jure acknowledge that part of the country is lost. I see the desire to end the war, but I don&#x2019;t see a possibility in which Ukraine signs an official peace treaty that gives five Ukrainian regions &#x2014; Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, and Crimea &#x2014; to Russia. And since Moscow is aiming to have an official peace settlement where its territorial claims are satisfied, I don&#x2019;t see how any agreement can be reached in the near future. &#x2014; Oleksiy Sorokin, deputy chief editor Question: People are still so afraid that any move Ukraine makes may be perceived as an escalation by Putin. However, everything Putin&apos;s forces do is an escalation. We so-called allies of Ukraine need to load up everything you need, no restrictions. Why are people so afraid of Russia? Answer: Because Russian propaganda successfully sold the story of Russia being a big and strong country with nuclear weapons that it can use. People in the West see Russia as the successor of the Soviet Union, which was a superpower of its time. The Soviet Union had far reach and it was a force that the United States had to reckon with. Through their activity in Syria, Ukraine, Georgia and many European states, Russia is trying to show that they have the same clout. Many believe them. This is also bolstered by Russian propaganda, which is one of Moscow&#x2019;s most successful institutions. Many people in the West are sold the idea that Russia is an eternal country, something that can&#x2019;t be defeated. Writers like Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky are sold to show the magnitude of Russia&#x2019;s culture through the ages, Napoleonic Wars and World War II are sold by propaganda to show that Moscow always wins. Yet, Russia loses wars. In fact, it lost three of them in the past century &#x2014; Russo-Japanese War, World War I and War in Afghanistan. Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky didn&#x2019;t help them then. &#x2014; Oleksiy Sorokin, deputy chief editor Question: What is life like for the Ukrainians in the occupied areas? I hear it&apos;s pretty bad. What proportion of the Ukrainians really are Russian separatists? Aren&apos;t they getting bombed also? Do they support Putin? Why don&apos;t they just move to Russia, if that is what they prefer? Thanks for your response. Answer: We recently released an investigative documentary about the system of terror that came with the Russian occupation: &#x201C;Shadows Across the River.&#x201D; It can give you a pretty good picture of what life is like for Ukrainians under occupation. Abductions, torture, and even killings are very common, to say the least. Those who don&#x2019;t leave the occupied territories aren&#x2019;t automatically pro-Russian. They may have very diverse reasons to stay. One of them being that, following some twisted logic, Russians don&#x2019;t let people through their checkpoints and borders if they find any indications of their pro-Ukrainian stance on their phones. &#x2014; Danylo Mokryk, War Crimes Investigations Unit reporter Question: What proportion of Ukrainians in occupied territories support Russia? Answer: As for the proportion of pro-Russian people in the occupied territories, there really is no way to tell. We know that such people are there, of course. But no sociology is possible. The numbers published by the Russian government following their sham &#x201C;referenda&#x201D; are indicative of nothing at all. From what those who managed to flee the occupation tell us, pro-Russians are definitely a minority. &#x2014; Danylo Mokryk, War Crimes Investigations Unit reporter Question: What kind of rebuilding efforts have started in Ukraine? Answer: Physical reconstruction hasn&#x2019;t really started yet. There are a few examples such as Bucha and Irpin where homes, infrastructure, and businesses have been rebuilt after the occupation. But they are an anomaly, and for the most part, it is difficult to begin major reconstruction projects when Russia continues to bombard and occupy the country. Ukraine has made preparations for reconstruction, namely with projects like the government&#x2019;s DREAM system. This is an online database that contains all types of information on damaged buildings for reconstruction projects that allows citizens to monitor the process to ensure transparency. While there is a lot of talk about reconstruction and lots of international events about how best to do it, in reality, it&#x2019;s still a long way off. In terms of economic recovery, GDP growth this year is forecasted at 4%, a major improvement compared to the precipitous 30% drop in 2022. There was also a minor resurgence in economic activity this year, bolstered by inflation control and GDP growth. Importantly, the last year saw one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest foreign investment deals in around a decade: the Datagroup-Volia-Lifecell merger. The total value of the deal was over $600 million. &#x2014; Dominic Culverwell, business reporter Question: Why has Ukraine been reluctant to reduce the draft age to 18? Answer: Ukraine is unlikely to further lower the draft age to 18 for a few reasons, not least being the unpopularity of this idea among Ukrainians (both civilian and military). Kyiv has argued that its armed forces already suffer from a lack of equipment and weaponry, a situation made worse by delays in military aid from abroad. Zelensky argued recently that &quot;the priority should be providing missiles and lowering Russia&apos;s military potential, not Ukraine&apos;s draft age.&quot; So, while a lower draft age would increase the number of available troops, there could be challenges in equipping them. Another reason is simply Ukraine&apos;s demographic crisis, which has been exacerbated by Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Ukraine&apos;s population has declined by over 10 million since Russia first invaded in 2014, and now has the lowest birthrate in Europe, with 30% of the population being pensioners. From Ukraine&apos;s perspective, sending young men to fight would therefore exacerbate this problem, as another cohort of men could be killed before they had the chance to have children. We recently published an explanation on this topic that you can read here, or you can watch this video on the topic on our YouTube channel. &#x2014; Elsa Court, audience engagement manager Question: I have read that 2 million Ukrainians are avoiding military service. Is it possible to come to that conclusion, and what do we know about Ukrainians staying abroad to avoid service? Any data on how many Ukrainians are avoiding military service would be either a speculation or an educated guess. It&#x2019;s impossible to make a list of them, given logistic constraints and their wish not to be found. Even the total number of Ukrainian men eligible to fight is unclear, since the last country-wide census was held in 2001. In my story about the Ukrainian government app Reserv+, where all military-aged men were required to update their data by July 17, the Defense Ministry data shows that 4.7 million people provided the info that would allow authorities to find them. Meanwhile, the KI Insights chart in the story shows that there are estimated 9 million draft-aged men both in Ukraine and abroad. Although only about 4.9 million are estimated to be draft-eligible, that means they would still have to update their data in the government app. We might speculate that the difference between those numbers &#x2014; 9 million draft-aged men in total versus 4.7 million that updated their data &#x2014; points to the scope of potential draft evaders. However, it is a very rough calculation that doesn&#x2019;t account for variables like people with no technical means to use the app or military-bound women that were also obliged to update their info. Also, among those who updated the info there can be the evaders who bribed doctors to obtain a fake disability certificate, which would make them not eligible for draft. As for the Ukrainians staying abroad to avoid service, recently appointed Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in September that there are about 1 million military-aged Ukrainian men abroad. For comparison, a total number of Ukrainian refugees abroad is estimated at 6.8 million by the UN. However, there is no information on how many of these men are fit for service, or have draft exemptions based on life circumstances and could be drafted upon return. Their reason for staying abroad could also be considered different from avoiding the draft. For instance, the pre-Russian full scale invasion U.N. report in 2021 estimated that 3 million Ukrainians lived abroad to work. Sybiha added that the Ukrainian government collaborated with the Polish authorities to encourage some of the 300,000 draft-aged Ukrainian men in Poland to join the fight. To sum it up, there is no definite way to calculate the numbers of men avoiding service, and I&#x2019;m yet to find an educated guess that takes all the variables into account. &#x2014; Natalia Yermak, reporter Question: What efforts has the government taken to encourage military recruitment? Answer: This year, the government made an unprecedented push to encourage military recruitment. It lowered the draft age from 27 to 25, developed Reserv+, an app to easily process the data of the draft-eligible men and obliged them to update their info on the app over a 60-day period. Experts said that it increased the mobilization rate at least twofold. The government also introduced Army+, an app that is designed to gradually eliminate stifling bureaucracy. It is still limited in its functions, but the state&#x2019;s effort to modernize the army is encouraging. However, there are many things that the government didn&apos;t address to encourage recruitment this year. For the Army+ story, KI Insights provided a chart showing people&#x2019;s top concerns about joining the army. Some of them are hard to resolve, such as &#x201C;fear of death or injury,&#x201D; but others, like &#x201C;not enough training prior to deployment&#x201D; and &#x201C;insufficient gear,&#x201D; could be offset by better army management paired with adequate communication campaigns. &#xA0;&#x2014; Natalia Yermak, reporter Question: How can you travel to Ukraine? Since there are no commercial flights over the Ukrainian territory, is train the only way to access the country? Is there any train connection to the West other than via Lviv? How do Ukrainian authorities, including the president, travel overseas &#x2014; also by train? Answer: The train is the most popular way to get in and out of the country, but you can also drive and take the bus as well. Or, walking if you&apos;ve got good legs. I walked across the Moldovan-Ukraine border earlier this year, and there were quite a few other people doing the same. The most common entry point is from Poland, as trains from border towns like Przemy&#x15B;l travel directly to Lviv and Kyiv. It can be a fun, albeit grueling half-day journey, or a full-day if you&#x2019;re traveling from Warsaw or other bigger Polish cities since you have to swap trains at the border towns because of the size difference between Ukrainian and EU tracks. &#x2014; Dominic Culverwell, business reporter Question: When will Ukrainian airports reopen?Ukraine is expecting to reopen at least one airport in the coming months. The airport is likely to be in Lviv due to its proximity to the EU border and its distance from the front line, according to Marsh McLennan Senior Partner Crispin Ellison, who is involved in the project. Ukraine needs to confirm air defenses around the airport to secure the insurance, but it could open by the end of January 2025, authorities claimed. Ukrainian authorities usually travel by train, as do foreign officials. The state-run company Ukrzaliznytsia has special VIP cars equipped with a kitchen, conference room, and rather luxurious private bedrooms (compared to the shared civilian sleeping quarters). &#x2014; Dominic Culverwell, business reporter Question: How much does the Ukrainian military rely on Starlink? Do they have alternatives? Answer: The Ukrainian military heavily relies on Starlink. Since turning on the cellular network near front-line areas is unsafe, whether at the base or in one of the dug-out positions, the Ukrainian military often uses Starlinks for internet access without putting themselves at risk. Using Starlinks, the Ukrainian troops often communicate within themselves through Signal or WhatsApp, including operational information, and use mapping apps &#x2014; as well as to stay in touch with their loved ones. Starlinks, however, are rarely available at the positions closest to Russian troops &#x2014; there it is only radio communication or nothing. &#x2014; Asami Terajima, reporter Question: I would love to hear more about what it is like to report in Ukraine at or near the front lines. Do reporters sleep in abandoned buildings, treelines? What do they eat? Do they share meals with soldiers? Answer: It depends on what period of the war we are talking about. For example, when I began reporting in the war-torn eastern Donbas in the winter of 2023, I often lived with the soldiers in their cottage-turned-military bases or stayed at hotels in one of the cities, such as Kramatorsk or Pokrovsk, near the front line. If I am with the soldiers, they usually have a full-course meal that starts from salad to a can of porridge with pork, so I am always fed very well there. There are also restaurants and cafes working in these front-line cities and towns, so there are usually plenty of options. But now, with Russian forces making significant advances in the Donbas and the intensity of the first-person view (FPV) drones attacks, journalists tend to go less to the front line itself, and most of the work is focused in the rear, where it is safe enough to conduct interviews. Staying in hotels has proven to be extremely dangerous, especially after the two deadly missile strikes on the two major hotels in Donbas in 2023 and 2024, so journalists usually rent an apartment and stay in cities like Kramatorsk. In general, we try to limit the amount of time near the front line to reduce the chance of the unexpected. &#x2014; Asami Terajima, reporter Question: If Russia is allowed to keep the territory it currently occupies, how many Ukrainian citizens will be stuck under Russian occupation, especially young men? I ask because, though Russia has suffered excruciating casualties, I worry about young Ukrainians being drafted to fight their countrymen in the future. Answer: The Ukrainian government says it&#x2019;s about 6 million people overall, with 1.5 million of them being children. It&#x2019;s hard to say how reliable the number really is. According to Ukrainian military intelligence and to some people that we talk to, the draft of the Ukrainian men into the Russian army in the occupied territories is actually ongoing as we speak &#x2014; which is a violation of international humanitarian law. &#x2014; Danylo Mokryk, War Crimes Investigations Unit reporter Question: Will returning the 19,000 Ukrainian children who were kidnapped in this war by Russia be part of the peace deal? Answer: The return of the deported Ukrainian children is part of Zelensky&#x2019;s Peace Formula, as well as several peace initiatives proposed by other states. The Peace Formula encompasses the return of all deported children, prisoners of war, and Ukrainian civilians illegally detained by the Russian Federation. Kateryna Rashevska, a Ukrainian lawyer specializing in the issues related to the deportation of children, says that the return of children is unlikely to become a subject of bargaining. Instead, what may be subject to negotiation is accountability for the deportation of Ukrainian children. The Rome Statute provides for such possibilities. Article 16 allows for the &#x201C;suspension&#x201D; of an investigation to facilitate the achievement of peace. This may be something Putin could request. &#x2014; Olesia Bida, War Crimes Investigation Unit reporter Question: Recently, the Kyiv Independent reported that of the approximately 200,000 people who fled Mariupol, as many as 70,000 have returned to the city, despite it being occupied and having been badly destroyed in 2022. How is this possible? What kind of life prospects can those people expect there? Question: That number comes from a Ukrainian MP Maksym Tkachenko. In 24 hours, he withdrew his statement. Where did he get the number in the first place, remains a mystery. &#x2014; Danylo Mokyrk, War Crimes Investigations Unit reporter Question: What is the status of the big nuclear plant? Is it still occupied by Russian troops? Answer: Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is still occupied by Russian troops. Much of what is happening at Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear power plant is unclear because Russian troops don&#x2019;t allow Ukraine to access it. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been monitoring the situation on the ground. The Ukrainian Energy Ministry said in November that the plant was on the verge of a blackout after Russian attacks on power lines, adding that it is the second such incident in a week and such a &#x201C;serious violation&#x201D; threatens chances of accidents. &#x2014; Asami Terajima, reporter Question: How many Ukrainian civilians have been killed by hostile action since February 2022? Answer: The short answer is we just don&apos;t know. According to the UN, the civilian death toll since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion up until October 2024 is 11,973 civilians, including 622 children. But this comes with a massive caveat. The UN&apos;s official reports usually add &quot;the actual numbers are likely significantly higher,&quot; while almost buried towards the bottom in the methodology section, they elaborate and give an indication of just how much higher they likely are: &quot;The actual extent of civilian harm &#x2013; both casualties and infrastructure damage &#x2013; is likely considerably higher as many reports of civilian harm, particularly from the period immediately after the full-scale armed attack, have not been possible to verify due to the large number of reports and the lack of access to relevant areas. &quot;The number of civilian casualties is likely particularly undercounted in cities where there was protracted intensive fighting at the start of the armed attack in 2022 &#x2013; such as Mariupol (Donetsk region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region).&quot; The U.N. figure of 11,973 civilians consists mostly of Ukrainian civilians who have died in either non-occupied areas of Ukraine &#x2014; for example in Russian drone and missile attacks on cities &#x2014; or in areas of occupied Ukraine that have since been liberated, Kherson for example. This leaves a huge margin for error &#x2014; many civilians killed in areas occupied since February 2022 and that remain occupied are not part of the official figures, as the U.N. has not been able to access these areas to verify the deaths. Let&apos;s take Mariupol as an example, as it&apos;s very likely the place where civilian deaths have been the most underreported. In correspondence with the U.N. officials who compiled the figures, they told me they had managed to verify around 2,100 civilian deaths in the city. But they added: &quot;However, the actual number of civilians killed is likely significantly higher because there are reports that we have not yet been able to verify, but also because there are likely deaths that we have not received any information about at all.&quot; So how much higher could the numbers be? Again, it&apos;s impossible to say for certain but we do have some clues. An estimate by Human Rights Watch based on satellite images of mass graves said at least 8,000 civilians died during the battle for the city, but again said the true figure was likely significantly higher. Other sources and unconfirmed reports paint an even grimmer picture. And these figures don&apos;t include those who will have died since from the conditions imposed by Russian occupation in a destroyed city with little functioning infrastructure. While the death toll in Mariupol is likely one of the highest, the same reasoning must be applied to all the other towns, cities, and villages still under Russian occupation. So, while we can&apos;t say for certain, we can be sure the total number of Ukrainian civilians killed by Russia since February 2022 is far higher than the official number of 11,973. &#x2014; Chris York, news editor Question: Has the Black Sea been cleaned from Russian ships? Are the alternatives for grain exports over West European ports used? Answer: Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea fleet is still present, although depleted by Ukrainian attacks. Many of the ships have retreated from occupied-Crimea to the eastern end of the sea, stationed around the city of Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai. Russia is also constructing a naval base in Abkhazia, a Russian-occupied region of Georgia. Ukraine continues to export its grain through the Black Sea via a corridor it carved out in August 2023 after Russia dropped out of the grain agreement. But grain export is fraught with danger and Russia has damaged over 320 port infrastructure facilities as well as 20 foreign merchant vessels in the Black Sea since July 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said last month. &#x2014; Dominic Culverwell, business reporter Question: As an independent newsroom, how do you see yourselves developing while there is a war on? Answer: The Kyiv Independent was set up just a few months before the full-scale invasion, in November 2021. Since Feb. 24, 2022 we&#x2019;ve grown from 18 people to 65, launched multiple products and services &#x2014; including the War Crimes Investigation Unit, newsletters, anti-corruption investigations, and our own e-store &#x2014; published several books and have gone through quite a few operational transformations. It has been challenging, but it has also been the only reality we know as a company. Being a bridge between Ukraine and the world, we have had to become bigger and better every day. While the war is on &#x2014; and probably even more so after it ends &#x2014; our mission is crucial for Ukraine&#x2019;s survival and well-being. As we are looking into the uncertainty of 2025, we are planning for a few scenarios, including a ceasefire that won&#x2019;t be beneficial for Ukraine, a nuclear strike, Ukraine&apos;s victory, and reintegration of territories &#x2014; as well as a few others. But whatever happens, we will be staying on our mission, we will keep finding new and engaging ways to tell the story of Ukraine and the region, both editorially and through other media. And we will do our best to stay in touch with the needs of our audience and our community. After all, our strategies will always be driven by you. &#x2014; Daryna Shevchenko, CEO Question: Is there any tourism going on in Ukraine presently? In particular, in areas where the war seems a bit more distant &#x2014; for example, Lviv? Answer: There is! I wrote a story in February about war tourism in Ukraine. There are a few international tourists coming to Ukraine purely for a vacation but it&apos;s pretty small. Domestic tourism, however, has skyrocketed particularly in western regions. Since men can&apos;t travel, many go on holiday to resorts in the mountains or city trips to places like Chernivtsi and Lviv. &#x2014; Dominic Culverwell, business reporter Question: I&apos;m still wondering how Russia can be on the U.N. Security Council after everything it has done. Who needs to be putting pressure on the U.N. to either update or disband the Council? Answer: Unfortunately, there are currently no feasible legal pathways to remove Russia from the U.N. Security Council, as the U.N. Charter does not allow the removal of a permanent member. This is a deliberate feature, rather than a bug &#x2014; the U.N. Security Council&#x2019;s permanent members are based on World War II victors who wanted to ensure that the international body could not be used against them or their interests. A reform of a U.N. Security Council or its veto right (by changing the U.N. Charter) is also difficult, as it would require ratification by all five permanent members, as well as two-thirds of the General Assembly. It would effectively require Russia to vote against itself, not to mention China would have to vote against its ally. &#x2014; Martin Fornusek, senior news editor Question: Ukraine denuclearized in exchange for security guarantees. Why didn&apos;t they work? Does this invasion show that nuclear armament is the only effective guarantee? Answer: The problem with the Budapest Memorandum, under which Ukraine gave up on its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees in 1994, was that the document left it unclear whether it was simply a political agreement or a legally binding treaty. It did not provide guarantees strong enough to compel the Western signatories to step in when Russia launched its invasion. While the Soviet-era nuclear weapons may have provided some kind of deterrence for Ukraine &#x2014; though their possible usefulness is still debated by experts &#x2014; it doesn&#x2019;t mean they are the only possible security guarantee for Ukraine. NATO, along with Article 5 and the U.S. nuclear umbrella, is the most effective way to deter Russian aggression without Ukraine investing resources into developing and/or maintaining a limited nuclear arsenal. &#x2014; Martin Fornusek, senior news editor Question: Can you summarize how Ukraine is doing in its fight against government corruption? In short, I would say, it&#x2019;s not great but not horrible. It&#x2019;s important to remember that Ukraine has been on a long path to battle corruption since 2014, when the people of Ukraine overthrew a corrupt pro-Russian leadership, and the country took on a path of reforms. Anti-corruption infrastructure was created in the following few years, which included several agencies for prevention, investigation and prosecution of corruption. It wasn&#x2019;t an easy path. At every turn, people in power tried to sabotage or control it. It turns out, the idea of a truly independent anti-corruption infrastructure doesn&#x2019;t sit well with presidents and their staff. The war has been a setback. Martial law, classified defense procurement and draft evasion schemes are all ample grounds for corruption. While so many Ukrainians are making sacrifices to contribute to the victory, there are bad actors who see the war as an opportunity to make quick money. Ukrainian government hasn&#x2019;t made fighting corruption a priority, claiming that it&#x2019;s focusing fully on winning the war. In reality, corruption is an internal enemy that is undermining Ukraine in its fight against Russia. It has undoubtedly affected Ukraine&#x2019;s capacity to defend itself. Corruption in draft offices has left Ukrainian front-line units without manpower, and high-level procurement corruption has left them with fewer supplies than they need. The good news is, I don&#x2019;t think that the Ukrainian society&#x2019;s demand for ending corruption has gone down at all. I hope that if anything, it&#x2019;s going to be sharper after the war ends. Ukrainian people know, through the past revolutions, how to press demands in the way that they can&#x2019;t be ignored. &#x2014; Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief Question: Since the beginning of the full-scale war, what steps, if any, have been taken to reduce the very high level of corruption that was present in Ukraine before the war started? Answer: In a nutshell, while progress has been made, there have also been setbacks in the reform process. A new chief anti-corruption prosecutor, Oleksandr Klymenko, has been chosen after his predecessor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, got caught in a corruption scandal and discredited the anti-corruption prosecutor&apos;s office. Klymenko&apos;s record so far is better than Kholodnytsky&apos;s. As part of judicial reform, the two judicial governing bodies have been re-launched. However, this reform turned out to be controversial since selection commissions rejected many candidates with a good reputation and approved discredited and tainted candidates for top judicial jobs. One of those judicial governing bodies, the High Qualification Commission, has re-launched the vetting of judges and approved firing some of the most controversial ones. At the same time, the commission has also greenlighted most judges whom the Public Integrity Council, the state-sanctioned civil society watchdog overseeing judicial reform, considers to be violators of ethics and integrity standards. Another judicial governing body, the High Council of Justice, has made a preliminary decision to fire Pavlo Vovk, Ukraine&apos;s most controversial judge involved in many corruption scandals. The council has yet to make a final decision on Vovk. Before that, parliament had passed a law to liquidate Vovk&apos;s Kyiv District Administrative Court. &#x2014; Oleg Sukhov, reporter	https://kyivindependent.com/our-readers-questions-about-the-war-answered-vol-7/	2024-12-24T09:49:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183596448-1.jpg
Deported Ukrainian teen allegedly commits suicide in Russia	Ukrainian-born Oleksandr Yakushchenko, 18, who was deported from the Russian-occupied Kherson Oblast in 2022, was found dead after allegedly committing suicide on Jan. 10, 2024 near his foster home in Russia. His suicide almost a year ago was first reported by IStories investigative project on Dec. 24. There were no reports about investigations into Yakushchenko&apos;s Russian foster family, where at least one other Ukrainian boy currently lives. According to IStories, before the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, Yakushchenko lived in a family-type orphanage in the village of Tokarivka near Kherson, run by Lidia Sharvarly. After the occupation of the village early into the invasion, Sharvarly became a collaborator with the Russian authorities. When the Ukrainian Armed Forces liberated Kherson in November 2022, she fled to Russia, illegally taking several children with her. Yakushchenko was among at least 20,000 Ukrainian children that have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and sent to other Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine or to Russia itself, according to a Ukrainian national database &quot;Children of War.&quot; In Russia, Sharvarly refused custody of children, and Yakushchenko was placed in a Russian foster family of Natalia and Alexander Lukashenko in Krasnodar Krai. Eight months later, he committed suicide. The family denied their responsibility for the teen&apos;s suicide since he was legally an adult at the time of his death. &#x201C;He was just staying with us. We gave him food, well, you can&apos;t kick a guy out. He had nowhere to go,&#x201D; said his Russian foster father Alexander Lukashenko. A media report says that Yakushchenko told his mother in Ukraine about his plans to visit her a month before he died, but his foster family might have taken away his ID to prevent him from traveling to Ukraine, according to his friends. The boy&apos;s biological mother, Olena Yakushchenko, who lives in Khmelnytskyi Oblast of Ukraine, does not believe that her son decided to commit suicide. &#x201C;I do not believe that he hanged himself. I talked to him, he was happy. What could have happened in a week or two?&#x201D; says the young man&apos;s mother. The teen&apos;s younger sister, Khrystyna, was also deported to Russia and currently lives with a foster family there. Her mother doesn&apos;t know what happened to her. The Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets estimates that Russia has unlawfully deported up to 150,000 Ukrainian children, while other officials put the figure at 200,000&#x2013;300,000.	https://kyivindependent.com/deported-ukrainian-teen-commited-suicide-in-russia/	2024-12-24T09:35:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/02d875a4-af27-4d03-b224-af3e5adcbf70_cx9_cy18_cw87_w1597_n_r1_st_s.jpeg
Russia strikes apartment building in Kryvyi Rih on Christmas Eve, at least 6 injured	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked a residential building in the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Christmas Eve, Dec. 24, injuring at least 6 people, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Preliminary reports say that a Russian ballistic missile hit a four-story apartment building in the city, according to Mayor Oleksandr Vilkul. Two people were rescued from under the rubble. A 79-years old man, as well as 69- and 72-years-old women are in a moderately severe condition at the hospital, Lysak added. &quot;While the rest of the world celebrates Christmas, Ukrainians continue to suffer from endless Russian attacks. Terrorists do not understand human morality,&quot; said Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. &quot;Russians are murderers. Nothing sacred, no humanity,&quot; Andrii Yermak, the head of President&apos;s Office, said on the Kryvyi Rih attack in his Telegram. Emergency services are working at the scene as the toll is expected to rise. &quot;Unfortunately, we&apos;re preparing for difficult news,&quot; Vilkul said in a statement.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-6-wounded-in-russian-attack-on-kryvyi-rih-on-christmas-eve/	2024-12-24T07:01:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-24_16-38-56.jpg
Russian government considers restricting calls made via messenger apps	The Russian Digital Development Ministry and Russia&apos;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, are discussing the possibility of introducing restrictions on calls made via messenger apps, Russian state media Kommersant reported on Dec. 24, citing its undisclosed sources. The news comes as Russia continues to block foreign social networks and messenger apps, referring to companies&apos; alleged violations of Russian law. The possible blocking of calls is being justified by authorities as a crackdown on anti-fraud calls. According to the Russian telecommunications operator Megafon, the share of fraudulent calls in messenger apps is nearly 40%. About 70% of fraudulent calls come from abroad, the Center for Countering Cyber Fraud of the Russian company Informzaschita (Informprotection) claimed. According to Kommersant, Russian authorities are considering two scenarios &#x2014; blocking voice traffic only from abroad, and banning all voice calls in messenger apps. The final decision has not yet been made, Kommersant reported. Meanwhile, the Russian Digital Development Ministry told the media outlet that it is not yet developing regulations limiting voice traffic in messenger apps. The Russian government is also considering blocking WhatsApp, an app owned by Meta, a company labeled as an &quot;extremist organization&quot; in Russia. To avoid blocking, WhatsApp must agree to provide Russian law enforcement agencies with access to users&apos; personal information upon request. Senator Artem Sheykin said earlier that refusing to do so is a violation of Russian law. In March 2022, the Russian government blocked Facebook and Instagram. Two years later, Russia&apos;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced the blocking Viber and Signal &#xA0;apps. Roskomnadzor also began throttling YouTube speeds in July, initially blaming technical issues caused by wear and tear on Google&apos;s servers. Google dismissed the claim, while Russian lawmaker Alexander Khinshtein later confirmed the slowdowns were intentional.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-government-considers-limiting-calls-in-messengers/	2024-12-24T05:57:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147932967.jpg
Ukraine receives $1bn from Japan, UK through World Bank DPL program	Ukraine has received $1bn from Japan and the U.K. through the World Bank&#x2019;s Growth Foundations Development Policy Loan (DPL) program, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Dec. 24. &#x201C;The funds raised will be used to strengthen our economy and finance priority expenditures in the social and humanitarian spheres,&#x201D; he said in a post on Telegram. &#x201C;We thank the World Bank, the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom for their significant support to Ukraine and their contribution to strengthening our resilience.&#x201D; Deputy Minister of Finance Olha Zykova previously highlighted how such loans bolsters Ukraine&apos;s budget while also enhancing economic development by improving productivity, access to export markets, and implementing necessary reforms for European integration. Ukraine&apos;s recovery and reconstruction costs stemming from Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion are estimated to be $486 billion, according to the World Bank&apos;s assessment published on Feb. 15.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1bn-from-japan-uk-through-world-bank-dpl-program/	2024-12-24T05:38:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243546154.jpeg
Russia trying to seize bridgehead on west bank of Dnipro, but no talk of storming Kherson, military says	Russian troops are likely seeking to seize a bridgehead on the western bank of the Dnipro River or one of its islands in order to transfer firepower there, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Dec. 24. Voloshyn&apos;s statement comes amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops were carrying out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. From the new foothold, Russian forces could fire on Kherson and the Ukrainian military units located in the coastal zone on the western bank of the Dnipro, Voloshyn said. Russian forces conduct five to seven assaults by small infantry groups in this area of the front line every day to &quot;detect weaknesses in Ukrainian defense,&quot; according to the official. &quot;The enemy has launched similar assaults on Kozatsky Island, and for several days in a row, they (Russian forces) have been trying to land on Velykyi Potemkin Island, and before that, they tried to land on the southern island of Zabych,&quot; Voloshyn said, adding that Russia also carried out similar assaults near the Antonivskyi bridges two weeks ago. These efforts are not an attempt to make &quot;a big assault or force the Dnipro River,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;Such (small) groups do not do this. Much larger forces do this, but it is very difficult to hide them with modern intelligence means,&quot; he added. Even if the information about a possible Russian offensive on Kherson turns out to be true, &quot;it will be fatal for the Russian forces,&quot; Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, head of the internal and information policy department of the Kherson Regional Military Administration, told the media. Meanwhile, if the military warns of such a danger, the local authorities are ready to announce additional evacuations from the city and its neighborhoods, the official said. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022, and Russian troops were pushed to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-wants-to-seize-bridgehead-on-western-bank-of-dnipro-but-there-is-no-talk-of-storming-kherson-military-says/	2024-12-24T05:03:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1898131278.jpg
Russian-installed head of occupied Berdiansk suffers injuries due to his car explosion	Vasyl Nechet, the Russian-installed head of occupied Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, has been injured after his car exploded, Suspilne reported on Dec. 24, citing Mykola Matvienko, acting head of the Berdiansk city military administration. The cause of the explosion has not been reported, but Russian officials, their proxies, and collaborators have been routinely targeted in both occupied parts of Ukraine and inside Russia. Kyiv does not typically comment on the attacks or claim responsibility. Nechet&apos;s car exploded in a yard outside a house. As a result of the explosion, Nechet was hospitalized, according to the Telegram channel of the women&apos;s resistance movement Zla Mavka (Angry Mavka). His current condition is not known. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Before the occupation of Berdiansk, Nechet ran a house of culture. Later, he contributed to establishing the pro-Russian regime in the city, joined Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s ruling United Russia party, and was appointed head of the occupation council. Ukrainian authorities have accused Nechet of collaborationism. Russia has occupied Berdiansk since early 2022. The city lies at the Azov Sea and serves as a key transport hub for occupying authorities, namely to ship out looted grain and other resources from occupied Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-installed-head-of-occupied-berdiansk-suffers-injuries-due-to-his-car-explosion/	2024-12-24T04:32:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/da37eecbea976a9f.jpg
US allocates almost $254 million for increasing missile production	The U.S. Defense Department has allocated $253.7 million to Williams International (Williams) through the Defense Production Act (DPA) to increase missile production, part of which will form military assistance programs for Ukraine, the Pentagon reported on Dec. 23. The announcement comes as the Biden administration attempts to increase military aid to Ukraine ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, amid concerns that a future Trump administration would halt weapons shipments before they reach Kyiv. The additional funding will allow Williams to increase engine production capacity to meet the Defense Department&apos;s needs for ramping up the manufacturing of Harpoon, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM), Tomahawk, and other precision strike weapons. This step was taken in accordance with the National Defense Industrial Strategy until 2024, which aims to expand domestic production and ensure sustainable supply chains, the statement read. &quot;This effort is a key component of the DoD&apos;s strategy to accelerate the capacity and fielding of precision strike weapons to deliver cutting-edge capabilities and options to our armed forces,&quot; said Laura Taylor-Kale, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy. Funds for the DPA procurements are allocated under the Indo-Pacific Supplemental Security Appropriations Act of 2024 and Ukraine Supplemental Security Appropriations Act of 2024, which includes increasing the production capacity of critical materials needed to defend against aggression. &quot;This facilitization effort is instrumental for both the Air Force and the Navy&apos;s engine-reliant weapons and is necessary to enable the rapid replenishment of our Nation&apos;s long-range weapons of choice,&quot; the Pentagon said. The U.S. provided more than $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine under the Biden administration. The Biden administration is planning to announce in the coming days its final aid package under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) worth around $1.2 billion, Reuters reported on Dec. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-allocates-almost-254-million-for-increasing-missile-production-particularly-to-help-ukraine/	2024-12-24T03:21:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/--------------2024-03-19-202210.png
WhatsApp may be blocked in 2025 in Russia if company doesn't comply with law, senator says	Russia may block WhatsApp in 2025 if the messenger&apos;s management does not comply with Russian laws, Russian state-controlled news agency RIA Novosti reported on Dec. 23, citing Senator Artem Sheykin. Russia declared Meta, the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, an &quot;extremist organization&quot; in 2022. WhatsApp is the only company&apos;s service that has not yet been blocked in Russia. However, on Dec. 19, the app was added to the register of information distributors, which requires it to store user data and hand it over at the request of Russian law enforcement agencies. &quot;If the messenger fails to fulfill certain requirements and obligations, the probability of blocking may increase,&quot; Sheykin said. &quot;The development of the situation with WhatsApp in Russia in 2025 will depend on the position of the messenger&apos;s management on storing information about users and correspondence and providing it at the request of the FSB (Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service),&quot; Sheykin added. The Russian independent publication Verstka reported this summer, citing sources at Russian IT company VK, that WhatsApp could already be blocked in the fall, and VK was developing an application to replace it. In March 2022, the Russian government blocked Facebook and Instagram. Two years later, Russia&apos;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced blocking Viber and Signal messengers. Roskomnadzor also began throttling YouTube speeds in July, initially blaming technical issues caused by wear and tear on Google&apos;s servers. Google dismissed the claim, while Russian lawmaker Alexander Khinshtein later confirmed the slowdowns were intentional. In December, traffic to the platform has plummeted to 20% of normal levels, according to the Moscow Times.	https://kyivindependent.com/whatsapp-may-be-blocked-in-2025-in-russia-if-company-doesnt-comply-with-law-senator-says/	2024-12-24T03:08:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189475787.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 5 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed two civilians and injured five over the past day, regional authorities reported on Dec. 24. Russian forces launched 60 drones at Ukraine overnight from the Russian cities of Bryansk, Millerovo, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, according to a report from Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, and mobile firing groups shot down 36 drones in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts. Twenty-three drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 38 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and another two were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured in the embattled city of Pokrovsk, while another was killed in the town of Kostiantynivka. In the town of Siversk, one person was injured, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 66-year-old man was hospitalized as the result of the Russian attack against the village of Dvorichna in the Kupiansk district, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-5-over-past-day/	2024-12-24T01:57:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2184405015.jpg
Russian cargo ship Ursa Major sinks in Mediterranean after explosion	A Russian cargo ship has sunk in the Mediterranean Sea after an explosion onboard, Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry said on Dec. 24. The explosion occurred in Ursa Major&#x2019;s engine rooms just after midday on Dec. 23, causing the ship to list between Spain and Algeria. The cause is not yet known. The news website La Verdad reports the area &#x2014; a busy shipping lane &#x2014; was declared unsafe for navigation and a rescue operation was undertaken by vessels including a Russian military vessel, and a Spanish Navy patrol boat. According to reports, 14 crew members were rescued, and two remain missing. The ship was built in 2009 and was placed under sanctions after the launch of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine due to its owner&#x2019;s role in supplying cargo to the Kremlin&#x2019;s military. The Ursa Major left St. Petersburg on Dec. 11, and according to online tracking website Vessel Finder, was due to arrive in Vladivostok on Jan. 22. But on Dec. 23, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) reported a Russian cargo ship sent to Syria to bring out Russian military equipment had broken down and was drifting in the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;The cargo ship Sparta, which Russia sent to transport its weapons and equipment from Syria, broke down during movement. A fuel pipe of the main engine failed,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence claimed. The picture accompanying HUR&#x2019;s post on social media showed an old picture of the Ursa Major when it was called Sparta III. Another Russian ship called Sparta is also currently operating in the Mediterranean Sea in the vicinity of the Ursa Major. Russian independent news outlet Meduza, citing OSINT analysts, suggests both ships could be part of Russian convoy to evacuate military equipment from Syria, though this has not been confirmed. Oboronlogistics, the company which owns both boats, said the Ursa Major was carrying equipment for the &#x201C;implementation of state tasks for the development of port infrastructure and the Northern Sea Route.&#x201D; Video and pictures of the ship posted to social media by OSINT analysts suggest it was carrying cranes of the type used for loading and unloading in ports. Russia, the main backer of the recently ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, began evacuating its military stationed in its bases in Syria. According to HUR, Russian military assets in Syria are now limited to two bases: the airbase in Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus. In an earlier statement, the agency claimed that losing the Tartus and Khmeimim bases would significantly damage Russia&apos;s presence in the Middle East and solidify its defeat in the region. According to the agency, the victorious rebel leadership is negotiating with the Kremlin to close their remaining bases in the country no later than February 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-cargo-ship-ursa-major-sinks-in-mediterranean-after-explosion/	2024-12-24T01:44:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/02.jpg
Ukrainian volunteers developing more powerful model of Trembita missile capable of reaching Moscow, The Economist reports	Ukrainian volunteers are developing a larger, and more powerful version of the Trembita missile that can reach Moscow, The Economist reported on Dec. 23. The first designs of the Trembita, named after a Ukrainian alpine horn, were unveiled in 2023. The basic Trembita, developed by Ukrainian engineers, is significantly cheaper than Western or Russian missiles, and operates like the V1 flying bombs used by Germany during World War II. The precise timeline for completing the production of the updated missile version is not yet clear. Meanwhile, the developers have spent a year and a half creating the basic design of the weapon, which usually takes several years, The Economist reported, adding serial production is set to follow the final field tests. The Trembita cruise missile flies at 400 kmh (248 mph) with a range of 200 km (124 miles). One unit costs $3,000, and a 20-30-kilogram warhead is priced at $15,000. One barrier to the rapid development of modern Ukrainian weapons is funding. When the government finances production at the stage where the missile has proven it can fly, manufacturers often must risk their own financial contributions. Ukraine offers private missile manufacturers the same maximum 25% profit margin it gives to drone manufacturers, according to The Economist. A senior security official also told the media outlet that Ukraine is &quot;at least a year away&quot; from producing missiles in the numbers, range, and capabilities that would &quot;seriously threaten Russia.&quot; Long-range domestic weapons are critical to Ukraine&apos;s defense strategy. They provide the country&apos;s military with an alternative to Western arms, whose use is often restricted. They also compensate for the lack of artillery ammunition on the battlefield. Almost 100 of Ukraine&apos;s new Peklo missile-drone hybrids have been produced as the weapon entered serial production, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Dec. 16. President Volodymyr Zelenksy previously announced that another Ukrainian missile, dubbed Ruta (Rue), passed tests successfully.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-volunteers-developing-more-powerful-model-of-trembita-missile-capable-of-reaching-moscow-the-economist-reports/	2024-12-24T00:28:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1253226700.jpg
Ukrainian drones attack Russian city of Millerovo, Rostov Oblast, acting governor says	Ukrainian drones targeted the city of Millerovo in Russia&#x2019;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Dec. 24, Yury Slyusar, the local acting governor, said. Millerovo hosts a military airbase. According to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, it houses fighter jets that &#x201C;perform tasks to support Russian infantry operating in the east and south of Ukraine.&#x201D; Russian air defense and mobile fire groups had reportedly been repelling the attack since 9 p.m. on Dec. 23. As a result of the strike, eight drones were destroyed, and four more were intercepted by electronic warfare in the Millerovo and Tarasov districts, according to Slyusar. In a morning report, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that three Ukrainian drones were shot down over Rostov Oblast, and another over Voronezh Oblast. Both regions border Ukraine to the west. No one was injured in the attack, the acting governor added, but videos posted to social media showed a series of large explosions. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Millerovo has been attacked before. A missile was shot down over the city on Dec. 22, the independent news channel Astra reported. Earlier in December, Ukraine also targeted the Rostov Oblast&apos;s Kamensky Combine, one of the largest chemical plants in Russia, with six U.S.-made ATACMS and four British Storm Shadow missiles, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed. The facility has been sanctioned by the EU, U.K., and U.S. for its role in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-attack-city-of-millerovo-in-rostov-oblast-acting-governor-says/	2024-12-23T23:46:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GfhpjbiXMAAyrwQ.jpeg
General Staff: Russia has lost 777,720 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 777,720 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 24. This number includes 1,630 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,624 tanks, 19,915 armored fighting vehicles, 32,086 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,323 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,030 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,834 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-777-720-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-23T22:38:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187899885.jpg
Italy extends military support to Ukraine through 2025	Italy&apos;s cabinet approved a decree on Dec. 23 extending the supply of &quot;means, materials, and equipment&quot; to Ukraine through the end of 2025, according to a government statement. The move reinforces Italy&apos;s commitment to supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense against Russia. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Italy has delivered 10 military aid packages to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s government. These packages have included advanced systems like the French-Italian SAMP/T air defense units. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who took office in late 2022, has consistently supported Kyiv and pledged unwavering assistance until the war ends. Her stance comes amid questions about the United States&apos; future approach when Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has revealed major shortcomings in manufacturing and procurement within Western defense industries, sparking urgent demands to enhance production capacities. Trump has indicated that U.S. support for NATO countries not meeting their commitments could be reduced and has alluded to the possibility of cutting back aid to Ukraine. As president of the Group of Seven (G7) this year, Italy has consistently led efforts to support Ukraine. The G7 nations have condemned Russia&apos;s aggression, reaffirmed their backing for Kyiv, and committed to a $50 billion loan funded by frozen Russian assets. On Dec. 12, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also called on alliance members to enhance military aid to Ukraine, emphasizing the need to strengthen Kyiv&apos;s position ahead of potential peace talks with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/italy-extends-military-support-to-ukraine-through-2025/	2024-12-23T21:10:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky-and-Meloni-1.jpeg
EU to produce 2 million artillery shells in 2025, new defense commissioner tells media	The European Union is expected to manufacture around two million artillery shells in 2025, Andrius Kubilius, the newly appointed EU Commissioner for Defense and Space, told Hromadske news outlet. Addressing concerns about whether Europe has sufficient production capacity to boost military support for Ukraine, Kubilius said that only 20-25% of EU-supplied weapons are produced within the bloc, with the remainder purchased from external sources. Kubilius emphasized that increasing arms production in the EU depends on orders from European governments, which are currently insufficient. Without long-term contracts with defense manufacturers, he warned, Europe is unlikely to ramp up weapons and ammunition production for Ukraine in the coming years. &quot;EU budget funds cannot be used to buy weapons for Ukraine. There are numerous restrictions on investing in defense industries outside the EU. However, funds from the European Peace Facility or frozen Russian assets can be utilized for arms procurement,&quot; Kubilius explained. Next year, Ukraine is set to receive approximately 30 billion euros from the EU, Kubilius said, leaving Ukrainian authorities to decide how much of this support will go toward defense. Kubilius said there is also a new mechanism being introduced to integrate Ukraine&apos;s defense industry into the European defense ecosystem. The European Council, in its final communiqu&#xE9; from the summit held on Dec. 18-19, urged EU member states to immediately enhance military aid to Ukraine. Leaders called for faster delivery of air defense systems, ammunition, and missiles, as well as additional training and equipment for new Ukrainian brigades.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-produce-2-million-artillery-shells-in-2025-new-defense-commissioner-tells-media/	2024-12-23T19:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1581554922.jpg
Parliament proposes bill to allow male students free travel from Ukraine	The Verkhovna Rada is drafting a bill that will allow Ukrainian students enrolled in universities abroad to freely cross Ukraine&apos;s borders. The potential change in legislature applies to male Ukrainian students enrolled full-time in higher education institutions abroad. Deputy head of the Verkhovna Rada&apos;s committee on human rights, Ruslan Horbenko said on Dec. 23 that the bill aims to strengthen the connection between young Ukrainians abroad and their homeland. Martial law prohibits men aged 18-60 from leaving Ukraine, with few exceptions, since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. &quot;We must grant this category of citizens the right to leave and return to Ukraine without hindrance to update their documents, visas, or military records,&quot; Horbenko was quoted as saying. &quot;This is also necessary to maintain the connection between young people and their homeland, as well as their families in Ukraine.&quot; Once entering the country from abroad, most male students currently cannot leave Ukraine again. The proposed bill is a departure from U.S. calls to lower the mobilization age in Ukraine. In recent months, U.S. lawmakers have pressured Ukrainian authorities to lower the mobilization age from 25 to 18. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 9 that Ukraine will not use &quot;the youth of soldiers&quot; to make up for its gaps in military equipment and training. Zelensky added that Ukraine&apos;s focus should be equipping and training &quot;existing brigades&quot; and that allies should work together to end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/draft-bill-to-allow-male-students-to-travel-freely/	2024-12-23T17:37:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1813816466.jpg
Ukraine receives 86 million euros from European Investment Bank to protect energy infrastructure from drone attacks	The European Investment Bank (EIB) has provided Ukraine&apos;s state energy company, Ukrenergo, with 86 million euros ($89.5 million) to protect Ukraine&apos;s energy system from drone strikes, the EIB announced on Dec. 23. The funding comes as Russia continues to target Ukrainian energy infrastructure, testing Ukrainians&apos; resolve as they endure another harsh winter. Earlier this month, Russia carried out one of its largest attacks on Ukraine&apos;s electric grid, with 90 missiles and 200 drones again targeted Ukraine&apos;s thermal power plants. Anti-drone shelters will be constructed with the funding to protect electricity transmission equipment and make Ukraine&apos;s energy grid more reliable and resilient, the EIB said. &quot;This &#x20AC;86 million investment is an important step in fortifying Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure against ongoing military aggression. By supporting Ukrenergo in constructing protective anti-drone shelters, we aim to ensure the uninterrupted delivery of electricity across the country,&quot; EIB Vice-President Teresa Czerwinska said in a statement. The investment marks the first measures in the EIB&apos;s Ukraine Energy Rescue Plan after being adopted in October, which is slated to up to 600 million euros ($624 million) in financing for emergency energy projects across public and private sectors. &quot;The enemy has already launched over 1,000 missiles and daily directs hundreds of drones at our power plants, substations, and power transmission lines,&quot; Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said in a statement. &quot;Thanks to international support, particularly funding from the European Investment Bank and the European Commission, we are strengthening our ability to counter these challenges.&quot; Amid Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, energy operators in Ukraine are forced to impose scheduled or emergency blackouts. Blackouts disrupt daily life and essential services. Last March, Russia destroyed 80% of the thermal generating capacity of Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company DTEK, amid the third consecutive winter of energy attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-eu86-million-from-eu-to-protect-energy-infrastructure-from-drones/	2024-12-23T16:23:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1155888362.jpg
US plans to impose more sanctions on Russian energy by year-end, Ukrainian official says	The U.S. is planning to impose additional sanctions on Russian energy by the end of the year, particularly targeting Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet,&quot; Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president&#x2019;s commissioner for sanctions, told public broadcaster Suspilne on Dec. 23. Over 100 oil tankers part of Russia&apos;s shadow fleet, meant to evade sanctions, are expected to be affected, Vlasiuk said. &quot;There are high expectations from this package,&quot; Vlasiuk told Suspilne in response to the anticipated sanctions. &quot;This will significantly influence the willingness of counterparties to work with Russian suppliers.&quot; Vlasiuk added that the EU and U.K. are also looking to place additional sanctions on the so-called shadow fleet. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen previously told Reuters in an interview on Dec. 13 that Washington is considering more sanctions on shadow fleet tankers and has not ruled out targeting Chinese banks if they are found to be involved in Russia&#x2019;s war effort. Recent U.K sanctions and the EU&apos;s 15th sanctions package have already targeted Russia&apos;s shadow fleet, in an attempt to punish Russia&apos;s economy for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia&apos;s shadow fleet intends to avoid a $60 per barrel price cap imposed by the G7 on Russian oil to diminish Russia&apos;s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Vlasiuk&apos;s comments follows speculation that the Group of Seven (G7) is considering lowering the price cap, or outright banning Russian oil. Sanctioning Russia&apos;s shadow fleet would make existing and future sanctions on Russian oil more effective. Targeting many of these ships in one sanctions package means Russia will be unable to replace these ships fast enough to service its export routes, Yuliya Pavytska head of the sanctions faculty at the Kyiv School of Economics, said in an interview with Suspilne on Dec. 23. The U.K. sanctioned 20 ships on Dec. 17 and the EU banned 52 Russian ships from accessing EU ports on Dec. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-looking-to-impose-more-sanctions-on-russian-energy-by-year-end/	2024-12-23T14:46:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
Ukraine to prohibit withdrawal of foreign issuer securities amid efforts to curb bypasses to currency restrictions	Ukraine&apos;s National Securities and Stock Market Commission announced on Dec. 23 that it will prohibit the withdrawal of foreign issuer securities, with the ban taking effect on Jan. 1. The commission, which reached an agreement with Ukraine&apos;s National Bank to implement the changes, said that the changes will &quot;harmonize national currency legislation,&quot; and aligns with International Monetary Fund (IMF) requirements. In an effort to protect Ukraine&apos;s economy and to restrict Ukrainian capital from leaving the country, the country&apos;s institutions, including the National Bank, implemented strict currency restrictions in the hours after the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Despite the restrictions, the latest announcement by the securities commission comes amid efforts to circumvent restrictions using securities schemes. Since 2022, some investors, through Ukrainian investment companies, have been purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds in hryvnias on the Ukrainian market. These bonds are then transferred to foreign depositories, allowing investors to circumvent Ukraine&#x2019;s currency restrictions by moving funds abroad after the bonds mature, Economic Pravda reported. The circumvention scheme would allow investors to converts their hryvnia funds, despite the implemented currency restrictions. In a letter to Ukrainian financial institutions, the Ukraine&apos;s National Bank wrote that the majority of funds from the maturity of U.S. bonds do not return to the country, Economic Pravda reported. Despite the broad ban, two exceptions were made by the securities commission, including for the &quot;corporate actions of the issuer&quot; as well as &quot;reconciliation of the number of securities in the Central Depository accounts with data from international depository institutions.&quot; &quot;Today&#x2019;s decision is a compromise, as the issue at hand was a complete ban on the admission and trading of foreign issuer securities in Ukraine,&quot; Irakliy Baramiya, a member of the securities commission, said in a statement. &quot;Over the past eight months, the commission has held numerous meetings as part of the negotiation process with the IMF and NBU to find a satisfactory solution for capital markets.&quot; As Ukraine makes efforts to maintain economic stability amid the full-scale invasion, Russia&apos;s recent economic woes have plunged the economy into uncertainty in recent months. Russia&apos;s ruble has weakened to record lows, as war-related payments continue to rise.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-ban-withdrawal-of-foreign-issuer-securities-amid-efforts-to-curb-currency-restriction-bypasses/	2024-12-23T13:52:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157219700.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Over 3,000 North Korean troops killed, wounded in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	Key developments on Dec. 23: The number of killed and injured North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast has surpassed 3,000, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement shared on Telegram on Dec. 23. Russia has reportedly deployed about 12,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. Zelensky warned of the global risks posed by deepening military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, including the transfer of modern warfare experience and advanced military technology. &#x201C;There are risks of North Korea sending additional soldiers and military equipment to the Russian army, and we will have tangible responses to this,&#x201D; Zelensky said. He added that increased collaboration between Russia and North Korea threatens to destabilize the Korean Peninsula and nearby regions. Zelensky&apos;s estimation, that he said comes from Ukraine&apos;s intelligence, is a significant increase from other recent reports about the North Korean casualties. South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon told reporters on Dec. 19 that at least 100 North Korean troops have been killed and 1,000 injured, with casualties linked to their lack of experience with terrain and modern drone warfare. Reports of North Korean troops fighting in Kursk Oblast emerged earlier in November, but Russia reportedly started using them in ground assaults in December. North Korea appears to be preparing to supply more arms to Russia on top of some 20,000 containers it had already sent, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Dec. 23 based on its analysis of satellite images. It follows a statement by the South Korean military, which said earlier the same day that North Korea prepares to send more troops and weapons to aid Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Seoul officials told WSJ that approximately 200 munitions factories in North Korea are running at full capacity to produce weapons, with Russia providing fuel and equipment to assist Pyongyang&apos;s arms production efforts. Satellite images analyzed by WSJ show that some of these factories are being expanded. In return for its arms and ammunition sent to Russia, North Korea might have received as much as $5.5 billion, an analyst told WSJ. By deepening military cooperation with Moscow, Pyongyang hopes to gain practical battlefield experience and the ability to modernize its weapons systems, said. North Korea has emerged as Russia&apos;s leading ally in the full-scale war against Ukraine, providing not only ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition but also soldiers. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack. After reporting the first clashes with North Korean troops in the fall, Ukraine in December announced that Russia had begun using North Korean units in ground assaults in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. South Korean officials have reported that at least 100 North Korean soldiers have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine. According to lawmaker Lee Sung-kwon, North Korean troops are suffering high casualty rates in part due to their inexperience with drone warfare. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is attempting to hide information about North Korean casualties. A &quot;devastating&quot; fire broke out at a Shahed drone warehouse at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan, destroying drone parts worth $16 million, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Dec. 23. The Alabuga Special Economic Zone hosts the Yelabuga drone factory that produces Shahed-type drones for the Russian military, located more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. According to HUR, the affected warehouse stored 65 drone attack fuselages, as well as engines, navigation systems, and thermal imaging cameras for the production of 400 Shahed-type drones. &quot;Everything burned down,&quot; the agency said without explicitly claiming responsibility for the &quot;mysterious, devastating fire.&quot; Ukrainian intelligence agencies have been previously linked to a number of assassinations and sabotage operations deep in the Russian rear during the full-scale war. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;HUR reminds that there will be fair retribution for every war crime committed against the Ukrainian people,&quot; the intelligence agency said in a statement. Local authorities did not report any fire or similar incident in the Alabuga zone overnight on Dec. 23. Drones struck Kazan, Tatarstan&apos;s regional center, on the morning of Dec. 21, damaging several buildings but reportedly inflicting no casualties. The Yelabuga drone factory was launched in July 2023, aiming to produce not only Russian equivalents of Iranian-made Shahed drones but also the Albatross reconnaissance drones. Russia regularly employs Shaheds and its domestic-made variants like Geran for strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukrainian long-range drones previously struck the Yelabuga facility in early April. The first unit of the Ukrainian Legion, a volunteer brigade being formed and trained in Poland, has departed for Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Dec. 23. Bodnar didn&apos;t clarify how many troops were sent. The initiative aims to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces by recruiting Ukrainian men living in Poland and other EU countries. The training of the first legionnaires will continue at Ukrainian military grounds, according to Bodnar. The next group of volunteers is scheduled to sign contracts with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 10 and begin training in Poland. The ambassador described the project as a &quot;success story&quot; despite challenges and criticism from Russian propaganda. &#x201C;Our citizens who join it will have the satisfaction of good training,&#x201D; he said, emphasizing the unit&#x2019;s voluntary nature. Since its unveiling in July, the Ukrainian Legion has attracted over 1,000 applicants. The first recruitment center opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in Lublin, Poland. The unit is trained by the Polish Armed Forces as part of a joint effort between Kyiv and Warsaw to address Ukraine&apos;s manpower shortages. Ukraine recently reformed its domestic mobilization policies and is in talks with foreign partners to facilitate the return of thousands of draft-eligible citizens who fled abroad. The formation of the Ukrainian Legion reflects Kyiv&apos;s broader efforts to replenish its military ranks as the war is in its third year. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 23 accused Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico of undermining Europe&apos;s efforts to become independent of Russian gas and helping Moscow to fund its war against Ukraine. Fico met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal on transiting Russian gas to Europe past Dec. 31. Following the visit, Zelensky lambasted Slovakia&apos;s prime minister in a long post on social media. He called Fico&apos;s pro-Russian energy policy a &quot;big security issue&quot; for Slovakia and Europe, asking: &quot;Why is this leader so dependent on Moscow? What is being paid to him, and what does he pay with?&quot; &quot;It is worth noting that after their meeting in Moscow, Fico and Putin did not issue joint statements or respond to media questions,&quot; Zelensky said on X. &quot;They simply cannot say publicly anything about what they discussed in the meeting. They are afraid of the public&apos;s reaction.&quot; Under Fico&apos;s leadership, Slovakia took a sharp foreign policy turn, halting military supplies to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks and adopting more Russian-friendly rhetoric. The prime minister has repeatedly made controversial statements on Ukraine and the war that echo the Kremlin&apos;s talking points, gave an interview with Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, and called for the normalization of relations with Russia. The Ukrainian president said that though Moscow provides significant energy discounts to Fico, such discounts are paid &quot;through sovereignty or murky schemes.&quot; Zelensky referred to a recent European meeting in Brussels at which Fico allegedly did not want to participate in a joint effort to find a replacement for Russian gas. According to Ukraine&apos;s head of state, Fico instead wanted to &quot;assist Russia in pushing American gas and energy resources of other partners away from Europe, implying that he wants to help Putin earn money to fund the war and weaken Europe.&quot; &quot;We are losing people as a result of the war that Putin started, and we believe that such assistance to Putin is immoral,&quot; Zelensky concluded. Fico is yet to comment on Zelensky&apos;s statement. Zelensky also said that Fico refused compensation for the lost profit during the transition period and is &quot;interested specifically in the Russian gas&quot; worth $500 million per year, as well as profits from oil pipe that runs through Ukraine and &quot;gives another $500 million per year.&quot; Fico previously told the media that Zelensky offered him 500 million euros ($520 million) from frozen Russian assets if Bratislava supports Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, an offer the Slovak prime minister said he rejected. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told President Volodymyr Zelensky that his sometimes &quot;harsh criticism&quot; of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is unfair, Rutte told the German news agency DPA in comments published on Dec. 23. In the interview, Rutte said that Scholz&apos;s contributions to Ukraine are commendable. The chancellor ensured that Germany ranks second after the U.S. in military support for Ukraine, something Kyiv should also be grateful for, Rutte noted. The NATO chief nevertheless voiced support for supplying Germany&apos;s Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine without any restrictions on their use, a bone of contention between Kyiv and Berlin. Calls for Germany to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles were renewed once the U.S. authorized Ukraine to use its ATACMS long-range missiles against targets in Russia in November. Scholz, who is adamant about not providing Taurus to Ukraine, also recently made headlines by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time after over two years, leading to criticism from Kyiv. &quot;In Europe, it may happen that after one call, there may be a second, third, fourth, fifth... Because sometimes leaders want to (wrestle for) leadership. After that, there may be a wave of actual recognition of Putin,&quot; Zelensky said at the time. &quot;I believe that this does not strengthen Ukraine.&quot; Germany, Ukraine&apos;s main European backer, is currently facing internal turmoil after Scholz lost a confidence vote in the Bundestag on Dec. 16. This paved the way for early parliamentary elections scheduled for Feb. 23. Scholz&#x2019;s opponent, center-right CDU/CSU chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz, has expressed openness to the delivery of Taurus missiles. In the interview, Rutte also said he expects U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to pressure its allies and NATO countries to increase their defense spending. NATO allies reportedly plan to agree on an increase in their defense spending target from 2% to 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP) before their leaders convene for a summit in June 2025. Taking office in January 2025, Trump had hinted at plans to reduce aid for Ukraine and incentivize European countries to pay more for their protection. The Financial Times recently reported that while the incoming U.S. president told European partners he would not abandon Ukraine, he also called for raising the defense spending benchmark to 5% of GDP. Some European NATO countries have yet to reach 2%, while Poland, the biggest spender, is expected to invest 4.7% of its GDP in defense in 2025. Nearly half of Ukrainians, 47%, support Ukraine joining NATO even if some of its territories remain under Russian occupation at the time of accession, according to a survey by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center, published on Dec. 22. In case of such an accession, the alliance&#x2019;s umbrella of protection may be extended to occupied territories only after liberation. This represents a 14-percentage-point increase from a similar poll in June 2023. The poll comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s hesitance to sustain long-term support for Ukraine adds urgency to defining Ukraine&apos;s post-war security architecture. The poll was conducted face-to-face among 1,518 respondents in Ukraine-controlled areas. It also found that 36% opposed NATO accession under such conditions, down 16 percentage points since June 2023. The strongest opposition to the idea of such limited accession to NATO came from respondents over 50, those from eastern, central, and southern oblasts, and individuals living below the poverty line or without ties to occupied territories. The findings come as Ukraine faces limited battlefield success and growing discussions on security arrangements. While 55% of respondents view NATO membership as Ukraine&apos;s best security option, 60% believe it is the only way to prevent future Russian aggression. Other options, such as neutrality with international guarantees, garnered only 12% support, while non-alignment was favored by just 3%. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 1 that NATO&#x2019;s Article 5 might not immediately apply to active conflict zones, signaling a shift in Kyiv&#x2019;s stance. Zelensky also recently acknowledged that liberating some occupied territories, such as Crimea, might require diplomatic solutions, not military ones. This pragmatic approach aligns with NATO pathways resembling West Germany&apos;s phased accession during the Cold War, an idea supported by 70.3% of Ukrainians in a Dec. 10 survey by the New Europe Center.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-over-3-000-north-korean-troops-killed-wounded-in-kursk-oblast-zelensky-says/	2024-12-23T12:15:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Ukraine ends year battered, with Russian troops pushing north, east, and south	The entire year 2024 saw Ukrainian troops on the back foot, losing territory to the advancing Russian troops in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast and eastern Donetsk Oblast. Russia captured Avdiivka &#x2014; an industrial city in Donetsk Oblast &#x2014; in February, kickstarting Moscow&apos;s offensives all across the region. Taking advantage of a poorly conducted rotation of Ukrainian units, Russian troops launched a push toward Toretsk and Niu-York, towns in the mid-part of Donetsk Oblast that used to enjoy little engagement. Russia continued to gain ground on the eastern part of the region over the summer, gradually approaching Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, and Vuhledar. Vuhledar was captured in October. Experts say that Russia could capture Pokrovsk within &quot;months.&quot; North of Kharkiv, Ukraine&apos;s second-largest city, Russia launched a surprise offensive in May, further stretching Ukrainian troops who had already struggled to hold onto the current lines. The country is now ending the year with an unsolved manpower shortage, a looming defeat in several key battles, and little prospect of changing the situation on the battlefield. Despite being outmanned and outgunned across the front, Ukraine boldly launched a cross-border incursion into Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in August. As of December, Ukraine controls less than half of the territory initially gained and is preparing for a looming Russian counteroffensive that will involve North Korean troops.

Meanwhile, Russian troops have conducted a few attempts to retake the parts of the region held by Ukraine since Aug. 6. Some of the roughly 12,000 North Korean troops deployed in Kursk Oblast have participated in assault missions, according to a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence. A senior General Staff official told Reuters in late November that Ukraine had lost over 40% of the territory it previously captured in Kursk Oblast. Forcing Ukrainian troops out of the narrow foothold they control in Kursk Oblast remains Moscow&apos;s focus, the Ukrainian official briefed with intelligence said. Russian troops&apos; proximity to the town of Sudzha, which is an important supply hub for Ukrainian troops in the area is &quot;concerning&quot; due to rising logistic and encirclement threats, according to John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. A checkpoint with Ukrainian military personnel in the town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast, Russia, on Aug. 16, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Russian troops are merely a few kilometers from Sudzha, according to the Ukrainian crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState. With the Ukrainian-occupied Kursk Oblast foothold being &quot;fairly narrow,&quot; the toll of Russian glide bombs and artillery are having an effect, and casualties could increase over winter when it becomes easier to be spotted from above, Hardie said. As of December, Ukraine controls less than 500 square kilometers of Kursk Oblast, which is roughly the size of Chicago, according to Paroinen from the Black Bird Group. Northeastern Kharkiv Oblast is torn by a major battle north of Kharkiv, the second largest city in the country, and another one surrounding the city of Kupiansk, in the eastern part of the region. The front line north of Kharkiv stabilized in the summer after Russia launched an offensive in May in an attempt to capture the city of Vovchansk, held by Russia for six months in 2022. While the initial pace was quick, Moscow was unable to fully recapture the town of Vovchansk and advance toward Kharkiv. Paroinen from the Black Bird Group said that he doesn&apos;t expect Russia to make significant advances in the Vovchansk axis in the coming months since it would likely want to dedicate more resources to Donetsk Oblast, located east. He added that Russia had also allocated a substantial number of troops from the area to defend Kursk Oblast further north in Russia. Battle for Vovchansk, Kharkiv Oblast. (Nizar Al Rifai / The Kyiv Independent)Battle for Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast. (Nizar Al Rifai / The Kyiv Independent)About a two-hour drive southeast of Vovchansk lies the city of Kupiansk, which was also under Russian occupation in 2022. The front line there has remained stable for months, before Russia intensified its push in late November &#x2014; in what Ukrainian soldiers described as a tactic to prevent Ukraine from deploying units elsewhere. Russian troops briefly entered the town&apos;s outskirts before being pushed back days later. Russia has only managed to secure &quot;minimal gains&quot; toward Kupiansk, according to the expert. Paroinen said that a more concerning situation in Kharkiv Oblast is unfolding around the town of Borova in the southeastern part of the region and close to Donetsk Oblast. Russia has begun new attacks from the Russian-occupied town of Svatove across the Oskil River. &quot;I would watch the direction of Borova very closely, and also, if the Russians are able to restart any sort of major push towards Kupiansk,&quot; he added. In the northern part of Donetsk Oblast sits the Serebryansky forest, largely charcoaled and severely ruined after years of heavy fighting in the area. Russia has held the initiative on the front line near the Russian-occupied town of Kreminna in the nearby Luhansk Oblast and continues to pressure the Ukrainian defense there. Roughly 50 kilometers south of the forest rages on the battle for Chasiv Yar, a hilly town now partially occupied by Russian troops. Ukraine is trying to hold onto it at all costs after it was forced to withdraw from the ruins of Bakhmut &#x2014; about 10 kilometers eastward &#x2013; in May 2023. A Ukrainian soldier walks near a destroyed house and car in Chasiv Yar, Ukraine on March 16, 2024. (Roman Chop/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images )Russian forces have advanced past the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal, which is running through the city this autumn. They are trying to surround the town from the north and the south. Chasiv Yar is connected to another important city in Donetsk Oblast, Pokrovsk, via the T0504 highway. This highway has long been a key logistic route connecting the upper and lower parts of Donetsk Oblast until an unexpected Russian breakthrough in the southwestern part of the city made the highway obsolete. Pokrovsk, a city that spent most of the war being a logistics hub in the rear, is now the main focus point of advancing Russian troops. After capturing the village of Shevchenko, Russian troops are standing 3-4 kilometers east and south of the city, once home to over 60,000 people. Russian troops appear to be trying to &quot;wrap around&quot; Pokrovsk from the southwest to cut the roads entering the city, according to Hardie, the deputy director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Local residents walk past destroyed houses in the city, approximately 10 km from the frontline in Pokrovsk, Ukraine on Nov. 16, 2024. (Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;That&apos;s often how they try to take some of these cities in the past basically by gulping it and avoiding a head-on assault,&quot; Hardie said, adding that Pokrovsk&apos;s possible fall is a matter of months, not weeks. &quot;Russians would likely advance westward on the lower flank of Pokrovsk and capture the Kurakhove area to build &quot;a wide enough position to truly start attacking toward Pokrovsk,&quot; Paroinen said, adding that he expects the battle for Pokrovsk to start mid or late January. The Kurakhove axis just south is key for Moscow to prepare for the battle for Pokrovsk, where Russian troops are pressing from three sides. Russian troops often semi-encircle Ukrainian troops to capture certain land, which is usually enough to cause significant problems because it becomes difficult to bring in supplies, reinforce the positions, and evacuate the wounded, Paroinen said. Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. (Nizar Al Rifai / The Kyiv Independent)&quot;Ukrainian forces are refusing to pull back like they are fighting for every inch of the terrain, that means that they are constantly fighting from very disadvantageous positions,&quot; he added. The situation around the town of Velyka Novosilka, 55 kilometers south of Pokrovsk, is getting worse as well, according to experts. If Russia manages to advance from the village of Staromaiorske to the south and Rivnopil to the southwest, it could &quot;isolate the village from pretty much all sides,&quot; according to Paroinen. Velyka Novosilka is Russia&apos;s main target in the southern part of the region following Moscow&apos;s capture of Vuhledar, a mining town that has been a Ukrainian stronghold since 2022. Much like Kharkiv Oblast, the front-line situation in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast remains rather stable despite the Ukrainian military&apos;s repeated warnings about a potential new Russian push in the area. In the areas further west of Donetsk Oblast where Ukraine attempted to wage a counteroffensive in 2023 on the Orikhiv axis, Russian troops are unlikely to commit to a larger operation, according to Paroinen. Front-line situation in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. (Nizar Al Rifai / The Kyiv Independent)Kherson OblastFurther south, Russia has increased its aerial attacks against the Ukraine-controlled part of Kherson Oblast, including the regional capital. Yet, divided by Dnipro River, which is kilometers wide, there&apos;s no signs that either side would dare to conduct a river-crossing operation. Ukraine is trying to hold onto its limited foothold in the Dnipro River islands. Both sides have been willing to continue fighting over this difficult terrain in the Dnipro River delta, which has little strategic value. The battle is &quot;a bizarre aspect of this war.&quot; Front-line situation of Kherson Oblast. (Nizar Al Rifai / The Kyiv Independent)In the winter of 2023, Ukrainian soldiers spoke up to the Kyiv Independent about how a number of their comrades were killed in a mission they believed had no prospects. Severely lacking crucial resources from ammunition and drones to boats, the Ukrainian soldiers crossing the river called the mission &quot;suicidal.&quot; It is unlikely that Russia would launch an offensive across the Dnipro to get to the Ukrainian-controlled western bank of the river because it would be &quot;a very big gamble,&quot; in a similar way Kyiv&apos;s troops suffered heavy casualties in 2023, according to Paroinen.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-ends-year-battered-with-russian-troops-pushing-north-east-and-south/	2024-12-23T11:49:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175895776.jpg
Fico’s energy policy poses a threat to Europe' — Ukraine criticizes Slovak PM after Russia visit	The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico of posing a threat to Europe through his ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a statement issued on Dec. 23. The criticism followed Fico&apos;s meeting with Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies after Ukraine announced it would not extend its transit deal for Russian gas beyond Dec. 31. &#xA0; The ministry warned that Russia has long weaponized energy as a political tool, describing it as a source of corruption, dependence, and blackmail against sovereign nations. &#x201C;The weakness, dependence, and short-sightedness of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&apos;s energy policy pose threats to the whole of Europe,&#x201D; the statement read. &#xA0; Ukraine criticized Fico&#x2019;s actions as undermining European Union efforts to diversify energy supplies and reduce dependence on Moscow. The Foreign Ministry argued that Slovakia should have collaborated with EU partners to address energy challenges instead of pursuing policies reinforcing reliance on Russian resources. &#xA0; The statement also underscored Ukraine&#x2019;s sacrifices in defending against Russian aggression, protecting European security, and shielding Slovak homes from Moscow&#x2019;s actions. &#x201C;We will not accept the shameful policy of appeasement, which has already proved to be a mistake in the last century. The Slovak side should remember this better than anyone else,&#x201D; the ministry said, in a reference to the events leading up to the World War II. President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed these concerns in a social media post on Dec. 23, accusing Fico of undermining Europe&#x2019;s energy independence and helping Moscow fund its war against Ukraine. Zelensky criticized Fico&apos;s pro-Russian energy policy as a &#x201C;big security issue&#x201D; for Europe, questioning Fico&#x2019;s motives: &#x201C;Why is this leader so dependent on Moscow? What is being paid to him, and what does he pay with?&#x201D; Since taking office, Fico has shifted Slovakia&#x2019;s foreign policy, halting military aid to Ukraine and adopting rhetoric more aligned with Russia, raising concerns among Kyiv and European partners. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ficos-energy-policy-poses-a-threat-to-europe-ukraines-fm-criticizes-slovak-pm-after-russia-visit/	2024-12-23T11:36:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ficoputin2-6.png
North Korean troops deployed to aid Russia were Pyongyang’s idea, NYT reports	The suggestion to deploy North Korean troops to support Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine came from Pyongyang, not Moscow, U.S. intelligence sources told the New York Times, it reported on Dec. 23. While some Western officials initially viewed the arrival of North Korean soldiers in Russia as evidence of the Kremlin&#x2019;s desperation, U.S. agencies now reportedly believe the idea was North Korea&#x2019;s initiative, quickly embraced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. &#xA0; Since August, approximately 12,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Kursk Oblast, where they are fighting alongside Russian forces. On Dec. 23, President Zelensky said that over 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or injured in the region, significantly surpassing earlier estimates. President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned of the global risks posed by increasing military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, including the transfer of advanced warfare technologies. These concerns align with U.S. reported assessments that Russia is relying on North Korea and Iran to sustain artillery operations and drone strikes targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s infrastructure. North Korea has become a key ally of Russia, supplying ballistic missiles, artillery ammunition, and soldiers. The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 23 that Pyongyang is preparing additional arms shipments to Russia following the delivery of about 20,000 containers of weaponry. &#xA0; Ukraine reported that North Korean troops had been involved in ground assaults in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast in December. South Korea has also observed preparations for further troop and weapon transfers from North Korea to aid Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-deployed-to-aid-russia-at-pyongyangs-initiative-nyt-reports/	2024-12-23T10:19:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
YouTube traffic in Russia drops 80% as authorities try to curb access	Russia&#x2019;s efforts to curb YouTube access appear to be taking effect, as traffic to the platform has plummeted to 20% of normal levels, the Moscow Times reported on Dec. 23, citing experts. The ongoing slowdown, reportedly implemented by Russian regulators to restrict access to the service, has made the platform nearly unusable in the country. Russia&apos;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, began throttling YouTube speeds in July, initially blaming technical issues caused by wear and tear on Google&#x2019;s servers. Google dismissed the claim, while Russian lawmaker Alexander Khinshtein later confirmed the slowdowns were intentional. Khinshtein, head of the State Duma&apos;s Information Policy Committee, said the measure targets YouTube&#x2019;s administration for allegedly ignoring Russian legislation. &#xA0; By September, YouTube&apos;s loading speeds in Russia had dropped significantly, with the average video start time for fixed networks increasing nearly tenfold, from 1.21 seconds in June to 11.01 seconds, the Moscow Times claims. In December, operators extended the slowdowns to the mobile version of the platform, further hindering access. &#xA0; During his annual press conference on Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the restrictions, claiming that YouTube&apos;s declining performance was the result of the platform&#x2019;s own actions. He argued that Roskomnadzor&#x2019;s complaints against YouTube were justified, insisting the platform must adhere to Russian laws to operate effectively in the country. &#xA0; The move follows escalating tensions between Google and Russian authorities. In April, a Moscow court upheld nearly $50 million in fines against Google for refusing to remove content deemed by Russia as discrediting its military and promoting extremism. On Oct. 29, a Russian court fined the tech giant $2.5 decillion for allegedly blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda on YouTube. A 100,000-ruble fine (now $960) was originally imposed in 2020, and under Russian law, the penalty has been multiplied weekly.	https://kyivindependent.com/youtube-traffic-in-russia-drops-to-20-amid-deliberate-slowdowns/	2024-12-23T10:02:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2162696376.jpg
Latest Ukrainian ‘rocket-drones’ make up for absence of locally made cruise missiles	Ukraine has turbo-charged its long-distance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), making &#x201C;rocket-drones&#x201D; to compete with cruise missiles or save the trouble of asking for more Western-made ranged weapons. President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s administration has been showing off the latest results, with videos of the Peklo and Palianytsia missile-drones, which Ukrainian soldiers have begun deploying. The &#x201C;rocket-drone&#x201D; project has become a key goal for Zelensky in 2025. In November, he told the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliamentary body, that he wanted to see Ukraine produce 30,000 long-distance drones, and 3,000 &#x201C;cruise missiles or missile-drones&#x201D; over the next year. These &#x201C;missile-drones&#x201D; are a new genre of weapons that Ukraine is pioneering. Deploying new weapons to offset the lack of traditional ones isn&#x2019;t a new move for Ukraine. Just as Ukraine has deployed UAVs to take on roles traditionally reserved for an air force, such as aerial surveillance and targeted bombing, the rocket-drones are evolving to perform functions of cruise missiles, which Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t produce. &#x201C;They are basically the next evolution step of long-range deep-strike suicide UAVs,&#x201D; says Fabian Hinz, a research fellow with the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies who specializes in missiles. &#x201C;As with so many things, because of technology, the lines are blurring.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ukraine really is able to develop these small missile systems that are rather cheap, relatively easy to produce, but are still good enough to pack quite a punch and destroy some high-value targets, also deep inside enemy territory,&#x201D; says Fabian Hoffmann, a doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo&#x2019;s nuclear project, similarly specialized in missiles. &#x201C;Missiles and drones. A combination of words that until recently was something from fantasy. But today, a reality,&#x201D; Zelensky said in a Dec. 10 speech, highlighting that the Palianytsia had gone into production and the first Peklos had gone to the front. He also revealed that a mysterious analog called the Ruta had just passed testing. These missile-drones are mostly an evolution from Ukraine&#x2019;s existing arsenal of long-range drones into something resembling a small cruise missile. In that metamorphosis, the key is speed. Some long-range drones that Ukraine uses can already theoretically make it thousands of kilometers. The evolution of these newer models is primarily one of speed. Palianytsia, Peklo and Ruta tout max speeds of, respectively, 500, 700 and 800 kilometers per hour. That is largely thanks to jet motors, which allow the newer models to outfly the 200 or so kilometers per hour that the piston engines on most existing long-range drones offer. Even the Iranian Shaheds &#x2014; remarkably good long-range kamikaze drones &#x2014; typically max out in the 300 kilometers per hour range. &#x201C;When you have a jet-powered UAV or a cruise missile you can simply buy engines off the shelf. So a lot of these systems probably use commercial off-the-shelf engines which you can just buy,&#x201D; says Hinz, naming various German, Dutch and Czech manufacturers as likely candidates. As the speed has grown between these three models, so too has the sophistication of their engines. Based on the government diagrams, Hoffman says there&#x2019;s no sign of a true turbojet engine on the Palianytsias. Meanwhile, with the Peklo, &#x201C;the engine is actually top-mounted,&#x201D; says Hoffman. &#x201C;The engine is outside the fuselage. And that makes manufacturing easier because it&apos;s not as sophisticated, but a problem with that approach is that it creates a massive, massive radar cross section.&#x201D; A jet engine needs a fast stream of air to provide oxygen to its fuel supply. Other engines either work slower or require an oxidizer to accompany the fuel itself &#x2014; a major add-on in weight for a rocket that needs to go hundreds of kilometers. Other than the set-up of their propulsion, these rocket-drones are structurally almost identical. Based on the government-released diagrams, the Palianytsia is a slight standout in having much larger winglets &#x2014; to compensate for less updraft as a result of going slower, says Hoffman. Some of Ukraine&#x2019;s models are touching down on the battlefield for the first time. The Peklo and Palianytsia have been causing a particular stir across social media amid recent Ukrainian attacks on Taganrog and Bryansk. The actual deployment of these drones is tough to confirm. They seem to show up in swarms alongside foreign missiles like U.S.-made ATACMS in a barrage on an airfield in Taganrog, east of Mariupol. A popular Russian news Telegram channel identified wreckage in a village in Kursk as &#x201C;tentatively&#x201D; one of these Palianytsias in September, based on the fact that it had a jet engine. After a recent attack on Taganrog, a Russian military-tied Telegram channel Rybar roundly denied that the attack involved a Palianytsia or Peklo, or any other kind of drone, saying it was &#x201C;only six ATACMS missiles.&#x201D; That channel claimed that the one Peklo in the air for that attack was shot down by a Russian MiG-29 over the Black Sea. Another popular channel tied to the Ukrainian military wrote &#x201C;at the end of the day, they&#x2019;ll say they were ATACMS to avoid shaming themselves by pronouncing &#x2018;Palianytsia&#x2019;.&#x201D; The rocket-missile&#x2019;s name is a type of Ukrainian bread that Russians find famously difficult to pronounce. The Peklo is a Ukrainian word for hell. The Ruta is similarly patriotically named, dubbed in honor of an herb from one of Ukraine&#x2019;s most famous songs, &#x201C;Chervona Ruta,&#x201D; so popular it&#x2019;s often mistaken for a folk song. Based solely on Ukrainian government statements, the Ruta is the most mysterious of the drones under testing. While Zelensky acknowledged testing a drone by that name, it may not be, strictly speaking, a Ukrainian project. Destinus, a company with registrations in Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands, was showing off a drone called RUTA with a structure almost identical to the other newly rocket-drones and stamped with a Ukrainian flag at a weapons conference in France this summer. Destinus&#x2019; founder and CEO, Mikhail Kokorich, posted pictures of the drone at the conference on his LinkedIn. The Ukrainian government stays quiet about the producers of, particularly, its deep-strike drones. But fuselages from the Destinus Lord, a drone with an advertised range of 750 to 2,000 kilometers and a distinct resemblance to a Cessna with a square head, have turned up in social media posts purportedly from deep within Russia. It&#x2019;s a source of potential controversy. Kokorich is an EU-based Russian national who posted that he renounced his citizenship at the start of 2024 based on &#x201C;fundamental disagreement with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the policies of the Putin government,&#x201D; after his $1.2 billion investment fund was frozen back in 2021. The current French corporate registration for Destinus lists his citizenship as Grenadian, which sells citizenship in exchange for $200,000 in local investment. French business magazine Challenges wrote a profile on Kokorich, focusing heavily on death threats from Russian leadership. Most information available about the Ruta is on Destinus&#x2019; site, which lists primary advantages of combination of &#x201C;low cost, payload size and speed.&#x201D; It includes specifications for a low-cost and lightweight jet turboengine. Destinus did not respond to a request for comment. Among the new rocket-drones, Hoffman, for one, is most impressed with the Ruta. &#x201C;For the Ruta, in terms of the engine, it&apos;s the most sophisticated one because it has a bottom-mounted air inlet, according to the pictures that we&apos;ve seen,&#x201D; said Hoffman. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s similar to the (American) Tomahawk, for example. The engine is inside the fuselage and it only has an air inlet that sucks in the air, which is then compressed and mixed with the fuel inside the engine and then ignited to create the exhaust stream.&#x201D; He added that Ruta has advantages when it comes to stealth. &#x201C;If there&apos;s some radar close, it will definitely pick (the Peklo) up because the radar waves get scattered by the turbine engine blades at turning,&#x201D; Hoffman said. &#x201C;That creates a massive return to the radar. So these things are not very stealthy. And if you compare it to the Ruta, where the engine is inside and you only have a small air inlet, that thing is a lot stealthier.&#x201D; The concept of &#x201C;rocket-drones&#x201D; is novel. These new weapons split the difference between drones and traditional cruise missiles. As with much of Ukraine&#x2019;s drone developments, these are economical solutions. But that would be true on either side &#x2014; if Kinzhals were free, Russia would never launch another Shahed. Among major distinctions is that these rocket-drones hold much less explosive charge than traditional cruise missiles. Tomahawks and Storm Shadows, for example, carry around 450 kilograms of charge each. The new Ukrainian rocket-drones mostly feature payloads of around 100 kilograms. But possibly a bigger weakness of these newer rocket-drones is that they are less stealthy and more vulnerable to electronic and navigational interference than more classical cruise missiles. But at the same time, they are significantly less expensive than traditional cruise missiles. The price per piece on these projects is somewhere under $300,000, which makes them significantly more disposable than, for example, the $1-million-a-piece Storm Shadows. It&#x2019;s a market that Hinz sees catching on. &#x201C;These type of longer-range suicide drones are a completely new thing, which we forget a lot,&#x201D; says Hinz. &#x201C;If you would have asked three years ago, what was the American equivalent to the Shahed &#x2014; there was none.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ukraine is walking into a space where there&#x2019;s not really a lot of other states producing these types of systems,&#x201D; says Hoffman. &#x201C;This is actually something that the U.S. wants to do, but they haven&apos;t done until now.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/latest-ukrainian-rocket-drones-make-up-for-absence-of-locally-made-cruise-missiles/	2024-12-23T09:35:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187899760.jpg
Over 3,000 North Korean troops killed, wounded in Kursk Oblast, Zelensky says	The number of killed and injured North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast has surpassed 3,000, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement shared on Telegram on Dec. 23. Russia has reportedly deployed about 12,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. Zelensky warned of the global risks posed by deepening military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, including the transfer of modern warfare experience and advanced military technology. &#xA0; &#x201C;There are risks of North Korea sending additional soldiers and military equipment to the Russian army, and we will have tangible responses to this,&#x201D; Zelensky said. He added that increased collaboration between Russia and North Korea threatens to destabilize the Korean Peninsula and nearby regions. &#xA0; Zelensky&apos;s estimation, that he said comes from Ukraine&apos;s intelligence, is a significant increase from other recent reports about the North Korean casualties. South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon told reporters on Dec. 19 that at least 100 North Korean troops have been killed and 1,000 injured, with casualties linked to their lack of experience with terrain and modern drone warfare. Reports of North Korean troops fighting in Kursk Oblast emerged earlier in November, but Russia reportedly started using them in ground assaults in December. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean soldiers had sustained their first casualties during combat in the region. &#xA0; Ukrainian officials note that while North Korean forces are particularly vulnerable to drones, their presence has enabled Russian troops to make limited territorial gains in the oblast, retaking some of the land held by Ukrainian troops. &#xA0; The deployment of North Korean forces follows Ukraine&#x2019;s surprise cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August, marking an escalation of the war into Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-3-000-north-korean-troops-killed-wounded-in-kursk-oblast-zelensky-says/	2024-12-23T08:40:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Assassinations of pro-war figures seek to demoralize Russia, punish war criminals	The Dec. 17 killing of Russian Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov in Moscow &#x2014; reportedly by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) &#x2014; is the most high-profile assassination of a Russian military official to date. It&apos;s not the first one, however. Military officials, propagandists, and those seen as collaborators by Kyiv have been assassinated in Russia or the Ukrainian territories it occupies since the beginning of Russia&apos;s all-out war in 2022. Analysts say that such assassinations aim to bring war to Russian territory, undermine the enemy&apos;s morale, and divert Russian troops and security personnel from the front line. Another goal is to punish those accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine since it&apos;s impossible to use courts to bring them to justice, they add. In this screengrab from an AFPTV footage, Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces, speaks at a briefing over an alleged chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma, at the Patriot park in the Moscow Oblast, Russia on June 22, 2018. (AFPTV / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;These assassinations, particularly just a few kilometers away from the Kremlin, are a humiliation for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin as they demonstrate a failure of Russia&apos;s security agencies and that no one in the regime, civil or military, is safe,&quot; Jamie Shea, a defense and security analyst at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent. James Nixey, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, told the Kyiv Independent that such assassinations &quot;put the element of doubt into Russian generals&quot; as &quot;they are not safe either on the front line or in Moscow suburbs.&quot; The Ukrainian authorities have not officially admitted their participation in the assassinations. The SBU did not respond to a request for comment, while Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) declined to comment. Most experts who talked to the Kyiv Independent believe Ukraine is indeed behind most of the assassinations of Russian military officials, propagandists, and those seen as collaborators by Kyiv. &quot;The fact that (Ukrainian) intelligence services can carry out such operations in Moscow severely undermines (Russia&apos;s) morale and combat readiness. Every such operation is a failure of their security architecture,&quot; Ukrainian military analyst Dmytro Zhmailo told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It means they will keep more forces within Russia and move fewer troops to the occupied territories... It forces them to spend more money on security and take more actions &#x2014; strengthening protocols, spending more money, moving more troops.&quot; Erik Stijnman, a military expert at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations (Clingendael), said that &quot;senior officials will increasingly feel that they also are not safe from the effects of the war.&quot; &quot;This can have a strong psychological effect on senior Russian leadership and alternatively give a morale boost to Ukrainian citizens,&quot; Stijnman told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If this happens regularly, this may have an effect on the perceived effectiveness of the counterintelligence apparatus of the Russians. This may prove to be undesirable for the Kremlin, as it fears that opposition, in general, may rise when it is clear that the Russian intelligence community is also not omniscient.&quot; Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, said that such assassinations &quot;are predominantly aimed at attacking aspects of the Russian military system while increasing the psychological pressure on Russia by bringing the war home to Russians.&quot; &quot;Organizations like the SBU and HUR want to demonstrate their reach and capabilities and divert Russian intelligence efforts into intensive counterintelligence operations on home soil,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Another goal is &quot;justice &#x2014; showcasing that committing war crimes will have repercussions,&quot; Stijnman said. &quot;Those targeted by Ukraine&apos;s SBU are often war criminals who have been indicted by Ukraine&apos;s justice system and by other countries,&quot; Shea said. &quot;This was the case with General Kirillov, for instance. These people, protected by Moscow, are unlikely to appear before the International Criminal Court in The Hague. So their killing is a form of justice, and very few will mourn their deaths.&quot; Kirillov was the head of the Russian Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces. On Dec. 16, Kirillov was charged in absentia by the SBU for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. But Kirillov is not the first suspected war criminal to be targeted. In July 2023, Stanislav Rzhytskyi, a Russian Navy officer allegedly responsible for missile strikes against Ukrainian civilians, was shot dead in Krasnodar, Russia. Ukrainian media reported that Rzhytskyi commanded the Krasnodar submarine, which launched Kalibr missiles against Vinnytsia on July 14, 2022, killing 27 civilians, including three children. Another similar assassination took place in November 2024, when Russian Navy officer Valery Trankovsky was killed in occupied Sevastopol. Russian Captain Valery Trankovsky. (SBU source) Trankovsky was the chief of staff of the 41st Missile Boat Brigade and a &quot;war criminal who has ordered cruise missile launches from the Black Sea against civilian sites in Ukraine,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. He was also reportedly involved in the 2022 attack on Vinnytsia. Yet another alleged war criminal, Sergei Yevsiukov, was killed in a car explosion in Russian-occupied Donetsk on Dec. 9, 2024. Yevsiukov is a former head of Russia&apos;s Olenivka prisoner of war (POW) camp in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast. The Olenivka camp, notorious for the torture and abuse of Ukrainian captives, was hit by an explosion in June 2022, killing over 50 Ukrainian POWs and injuring more than 150. Kyiv called this a deliberate Russian war crime. The effectiveness of assassinations for Ukraine&apos;s war effort is difficult to determine, analysts say. &quot;The question of their effectiveness is harder to discern: while we can expect there to be nervousness in parts of the Russian system as to the extent to which the Ukrainians are able to identify and surveil targets, even in Moscow, and then successfully launch attacks, it isn&apos;t clear if they are impeding the Russian war effort,&quot; Savill said. &quot;For example, the Ukrainians have publicly identified personnel they believe are involved in the long-range missile strikes, and last year assassinated a Russian navy officer involved. But these strikes have continued, mostly constrained by production problems rather than anything else.&quot; Shea said that &quot;an assassination even of an important military figure like Kirillov will not change the course of the war.&quot; &quot;Russia has hundreds of generals, as Putin has reminded us since his invasion of Ukraine by firing so many of them for corruption and incompetence,&quot; he added. &quot;But the targeted assassinations can disrupt Russia&apos;s war plans and command and control system even if only temporarily, and they can cause many Russians to question what Putin is doing in Ukraine and his failure to guarantee the safety of Russians, as he has always pledged to do. They also help to boost Ukrainian morale at a difficult time on the battlefield in the Donbas.&quot; Stijnman also argued that &quot;(assassinations) will most likely remain a supportive effect within the frame of the war, as the primary reason for this specific operations will instill a sense of justice to Ukraine, but will not directly contribute to the war effort.&quot; There is a consensus among experts that Kirillov and other Russian military officials are legitimate targets for Ukraine&apos;s special services. &quot;Kirillov was a legitimate military target, considering the activities he led and oversaw in his official capacity within the Russian military chain of command,&quot; Karolina Hird, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;As head of the Russian Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces, Kirillov was personally responsible and oversaw the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine.&quot; Savill also argued that &quot;where these targets are part of the Russian military system or industrial production, they are legitimate targets,&quot; and &quot;Kirillov clearly falls into that category.&quot; Stijnman said that &quot;the operation (against Kirillov) seems to have been conducted within the constraints of international humanitarian law, as the attack was discriminatory: the use of a camera to time the attack, thus avoiding collateral damage, indicates as much.&quot; &quot;It seems that the Ukrainian government understands that there is a limit to what actions will be deemed acceptable to the West in order to avoid a decrease in the support for the Ukrainian war effort,&quot; Stijnman added. Shea said that &quot;this practice is more justified, and justifiable, in wartime and in circumstances where the normal course of justice, trials for war crimes and massive human rights abuses, is unlikely to function because of the total non-cooperation and non-compliance of the country responsible, in this case, Russia.&quot; &quot;Russia attacked Ukraine, and Ukraine did nothing to provoke Moscow&apos;s aggression,&quot; he added. &quot;So Kyiv is entitled to justify its targeted assassinations as legitimate self-defense.&quot; Shea said that it&apos;s &quot;noteworthy that Ukraine&apos;s targeted assassinations have not provoked criticism from Ukraine&apos;s principal supporters and providers of military assistance.&quot; &quot;It is accepted that, as long as the individuals targeted are directly involved in Russia&apos;s illegal aggression, this is one way that Ukraine can strike back at an aggressor who has committed thousands of war crimes against Ukraine, especially drone and missile attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure,&quot; he added. However, there is a discussion on whether some other pro-war individuals, such as Russian collaborators and propagandists, constitute legitimate targets. Collaborators have often been targeted since the invasion started. In August 2022, Oleksiy Kovalyov, a former MP from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party who joined the Russian occupation authorities in his native Kherson Oblast, was shot dead in then-occupied Kherson. Kirill Stremousov, a deputy head of Russia&apos;s illegal occupation government in Kherson Oblast, died in a car accident in November 2022. Atesh, a Ukrainian partisan group, claimed responsibility for his death. In December 2023, Illia Kyva, a notorious Ukrainian lawmaker who sided with Russia, was killed in Moscow Oblast. Then lawmaker Illia Kyva, member of the now banned pro-Russian party Opposition Platform - For Life, speaks during a rally in Kyiv on Feb. 3, 2021. (Aleksandr Gusev/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Russian propagandists were also targeted. Russian pro-war propagandist Darya Dugina was killed in a car bombing near Moscow in August 2022. Dugina&apos;s father, the Russian ultranationalist Alexander Dugin, is currently wanted by the SBU for promoting genocide against Ukraine. The Washington Post reported, citing its sources, that Dugina&apos;s assassination was conducted by the SBU, but her father was the intended target of the attack. Russian ultranationalist, Alexander Dugin, speaks at the funeral of his daughter, Darya Dugina, who died in a car explosion, on Aug. 23, 2022. (Evgenii Bugubaev/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Another propagandist, war correspondent Vladlen Tatarsky, was killed in an explosion in a cafe in central St. Petersburg in April 2023. The blast injured 25 other people. Savill said that &quot;some previous operations have been more dubious in targeting and execution (than Kirillov&apos;s assassination).&quot; &quot;For example, it is harder to make a case that Darya Dugina or Vladen Tatarsky were military targets, and in the case of the latter, he was killed by a bomb in a caf&#xE9; full of civilians, allegedly delivered by an unwitting courier,&quot; he added. Zhmailo disagreed, saying that &quot;anyone even remotely connected to the war is a legitimate target.&quot; &quot;The people (that Ukraine) has (allegedly) targeted have all been implicated in Russia&apos;s illegal war effort, either as military commanders (using illegal tactics such as chemical weapons or the massacres of civilians in violation of the Geneva Conventions), involved in the illegal occupation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, or acting as propagandists for the regime in spreading lies and misinformation,&quot; Shea said. &quot;So they can be classified as enemy combatants.&quot; However, such operations could jeopardize Western support in the future, according to Stijnman. &quot;The more Ukraine will struggle on the battlefield, the more Ukraine may feel the need to continue to counter the Russian threat via such (methods) but ever more via unconventional means,&quot; he said. &quot;The danger is, of course, that the size and scope of these efforts will increasingly create friction with international humanitarian law, possibly degrading Western support... Ukraine will need to walk a tightrope here.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/assassinations-of-pro-war-actors-seek-to-demoralize-russia-punish-war-criminals/	2024-12-23T08:34:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189847816.jpg
First Ukrainian Legion unit trained in Poland deployed to Ukraine, ambassador says	The first unit of the Ukrainian Legion, a volunteer brigade being formed and trained in Poland, has departed for Ukraine, Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Dec. 23. Bodnar didn&apos;t clarify how many troops were sent. The initiative aims to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces by recruiting Ukrainian men living in Poland and other EU countries. The training of the first legionnaires will continue at Ukrainian military grounds, according to Bodnar. The next group of volunteers is scheduled to sign contracts with Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Jan. 10 and begin training in Poland. The ambassador described the project as a &quot;success story&quot; despite challenges and criticism from Russian propaganda. &#x201C;Our citizens who join it will have the satisfaction of good training,&#x201D; he said, emphasizing the unit&#x2019;s voluntary nature. Since its unveiling in July, the Ukrainian Legion has attracted over 1,000 applicants. The first recruitment center opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in Lublin, Poland. The unit is trained by the Polish Armed Forces as part of a joint effort between Kyiv and Warsaw to address Ukraine&apos;s manpower shortages. Ukraine recently reformed its domestic mobilization policies and is in talks with foreign partners to facilitate the return of thousands of draft-eligible citizens who fled abroad. The formation of the Ukrainian Legion reflects Kyiv&apos;s broader efforts to replenish its military ranks as the war is in its third year.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-ukrainian-legion-unit-trained-in-poland-deployed-to-ukraine-ambassador-says/	2024-12-23T07:57:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1621128972.jpg
47% of Ukrainians back NATO accession even while territories stay occupied, survey shows	Nearly half of Ukrainians, 47%, support Ukraine joining NATO even if some of its territories remain under Russian occupation at the time of accession, according to a survey by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation and the Razumkov Center, published on Dec. 22. In case of such an accession, the alliance&#x2019;s umbrella of protection may be extended to occupied territories only after liberation. This represents a 14-percentage-point increase from a similar poll in June 2023. The poll comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s hesitance to sustain long-term support for Ukraine adds urgency to defining Ukraine&apos;s post-war security architecture. The poll was conducted face-to-face among 1,518 respondents in Ukraine-controlled areas. It also found that 36% opposed NATO accession under such conditions, down 16 percentage points since June 2023. The strongest opposition to the idea of such limited accession to NATO came from respondents over 50, those from eastern, central, and southern oblasts, and individuals living below the poverty line or without ties to occupied territories. The findings come as Ukraine faces limited battlefield success and growing discussions on security arrangements. While 55% of respondents view NATO membership as Ukraine&apos;s best security option, 60% believe it is the only way to prevent future Russian aggression. Other options, such as neutrality with international guarantees, garnered only 12% support, while non-alignment was favored by just 3%. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 1 that NATO&#x2019;s Article 5 might not immediately apply to active conflict zones, signaling a shift in Kyiv&#x2019;s stance. Zelensky also recently acknowledged that liberating some occupied territories, such as Crimea, might require diplomatic solutions, not military ones. This pragmatic approach aligns with NATO pathways resembling West Germany&apos;s phased accession during the Cold War, an idea supported by 70.3% of Ukrainians in a Dec. 10 survey by the New Europe Center.	https://kyivindependent.com/47-of-ukrainians-back-nato-accession-despite-occupied-territories-survey-shows/	2024-12-23T07:31:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-486250819.jpg
Satellite imagery suggests North Korea to supply more arms to Russia, WSJ reports	North Korea appears to be preparing to supply more arms to Russia on top of some 20,000 containers it had already sent, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Dec. 23 based on its analysis of satellite images. It follows a statement by the South Korean military, which said earlier the same day that North Korea prepares to send more troops and weapons to aid Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Seoul officials told WSJ that approximately 200 munitions factories in North Korea are running at full capacity to produce weapons, with Russia providing fuel and equipment to assist Pyongyang&apos;s arms production efforts. Satellite images analyzed by WSJ show that some of these factories are being expanded. In return for its arms and ammunition sent to Russia, North Korea might have received as much as $5.5 billion, an analyst told WSJ. By deepening military cooperation with Moscow, Pyongyang hopes to gain practical battlefield experience and the ability to modernize its weapons systems, said. North Korea has emerged as Russia&apos;s leading ally in the full-scale war against Ukraine, providing not only ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition but also soldiers. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack. After reporting the first clashes with North Korean troops in the fall, Ukraine in December announced that Russia had begun using North Korean units in ground assaults in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. South Korean officials have reported that at least 100 North Korean soldiers have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine. According to lawmaker Lee Sung-kwon, North Korean troops are suffering high casualty rates in part due to their inexperience with drone warfare. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is attempting to hide information about North Korean casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/satellite-imagery-suggests-north-korea-to-supply-more-arms-to-russia-wsj-reports/	2024-12-23T06:54:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157649988.jpg
Germany provides Ukraine with 15 Leopard 1 tanks, 2 IRIS-T systems, 2 Patriot launchers	Berlin supplied Ukraine with 15 Leopard 1A5 tanks, one short-range and one medium-range IRIS-T air defense system with missiles, two Patriot air defense launchers, and other aid in its latest delivery, the German government said on Dec. 23. With these deliveries, Germany has delivered on its promise to supply Ukraine with two additional IRIS-T systems before the end of the year as the country braces for intensified Russian aerial strikes during winter. Germany has also handed over a self-propelled Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzer, two Gepard anti-aircraft guns, 30 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAP), seven Caracal air assault vehicles, and 12 Kinetic Defense Vehicles. The latest assistance also includes dozens of reconnaissance drones, including 30 Vector drones, 24 RQ-35 Heidrun drones, and 14 Hornet XR drones. Ukraine further received 52,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition, shells for Leopard drones, radars, small arms, and other weapons, vehicles, and equipment. Initially criticized for its sluggish delivery of military aid to Ukraine following the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Berlin has become the second-largest provider of military equipment after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-provides-leopard-tanks-iris-patriot-launchers/	2024-12-23T06:07:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169575198.jpg
Moldova prepares for harsh winter, as Russian-occupied part of country runs out of gas	Moldova enacted a state of emergency, as the country gears up for an energy crisis at the start of 2025 following the end of Ukraine&apos;s obligations to transport Russian gas through its territory. Moldova, and especially the country&apos;s breakaway region of Transnistria, will be hit the hardest following the end of the decades-long agreement. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that the country has enough gas, bought on the international market, to keep the right bank of the Dniester (Nistru) River warm throughout the winter ahead. But, he added, some 360,000 citizens on the left bank of the river, in the Russia-controlled region of Transnistria, &quot;are still dependent on one source of import &#x2014; Gazprom.&quot; The leader of the Russian-controlled Transnistria declared a state of economic emergency on Dec. 6. Heaters, as well as basic goods like rice, grains, matches, salt and so on, have disappeared from shops, hoarded by the local population in anticipation of the crisis ahead. Following decades of relying on free Russian gas, the Moscow-controlled region will now need to pay market prices, lowered by energy bill relief schemes provided by the Moldovan government. Authorities in Chisinau and experts expect that Russia will eventually cover Transnistrian gas needs, however, ensuring transport via the Trans-Balkan pipeline, to keep the region afloat. They add that the rest of the country will most likely be cut off from future cheap Russian gas imports in order to stir dissatisfaction with rising prices ahead of the 2025 parliamentary elections. Transnistria, on the left bank, and the rest of Moldova, on the right bank, divided by the Dniester, are interdependent, as Moldova relies on cheap electricity produced by the Russian-owned MGRES, a company based in the town of Dnestrovsk, de facto controlled by Transnistria. The energy plant can switch to produce electricity with coal rather than gas but the transition may involve a 10 hour blackout, according to Transnistria&apos;s self-declared Economy Minister Serghei Obolonik. &quot;That is dangerous and many things could happen [during that window],&quot; said journalist Irina Tabaranu, who runs the media outlet Zona de Securitate, focused on Transnistria. Shorter blackouts may also affect both parts of the country in 2025, according to the government, as there haven&apos;t been any official announcements concerning the use of the Trans-Balkan pipeline yet. By cutting off Moldova from gas imports, Russia is giving up the leverage it had on the country, said former Energy Minister Victor Parlicov, who was dismissed from his post on Dec. 5. Moldovan pro-Kremlin forces, as well as some pro-European opposition voices, meanwhile, place the blame on the Chisinau government for this new energy crisis. Among the main faults cited was the lack of clarity about the country&apos;s future energy policy and little action to stock up while gas for the country was still cheap. As a result of the shortcomings, Parlicov, together with Victor B&#xEE;nzari, head of state energy provider Energocom, and Sergiu Tofilat, who served as a board member of the Gazprom subsidiary MoldovaGaz were dismissed in early December. Parlicov, B&#xEE;nzari, and Tofilat claim to be mere scapegoats. Vadim Ceban, the interim head of MoldovaGaz, who was involved in the gas acquisitions, is also to leave his job. Taking responsibility for Moldovan citizens in Transnistria and attempting to ensure cheap electricity for all of its population, Chisinau carried direct negotiations with Gazprom on behalf of the breakaway region, claiming an economic and political necessity. The step was unpopular with some parts of Moldovan society. Parlicov went to Saint Petersburg to negotiate with the Russian company&apos;s CEO, Alexey Miller, on Nov. 25, where they differed on a disputed debt unrecognized by a Chisinau-commissioned international audit.

(Hakan Akgun/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;It looks stupid to ask for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Transnistria and meanwhile request Russia to continue to give free gas to the region,&quot; Tabaranu from Zona de Securitate said. According to the journalist, this crisis could have been an opportunity to reintegrate the country. &quot;Why do we ask for help from international partners to subsidize our bills year on year rather than asking them to contribute to the reintegration of 11% of our country?&quot; she asks. &quot;Steps towards reintegration cannot be made at the moment due to the presence of Russian troops in Transnistria,&quot; Oleg Serebrian, deputy prime minister for reintegration, told Kyiv Independent, referring to the 2,500 soldiers stationed there. &quot;But we are closing the gap with people on the left bank (of the river) and showing them that Chisinau cares about citizens&quot; there. &quot;They feel the dependence on the Moldovan government.&quot; Meanwhile, Russia accused Chisinau that it coins a &#x201C;plan for a military operation&#x201D; in Transnistria. The Moldovan government rejected the accusations, saying it only relies on &#x201C;peaceful solutions&#x201D; in the reintegration of the country. Experts argue that the Russian disinformation campaign aims to distract from the energy crisis, sow further panic, as well as the grounds for possible provocations in the occupied region. The government in Chisinau is dealing with the looming energy crisis in the backdrop of the upcoming elections set for July. Prime Minister Recean, who has taken over the energy portfolio, said the authorities have reassured citizens they won&apos;t pay higher bills than last winter, although the needs-based subsidy mechanism has been changed from being calculated automatically to a cash-in-hand scheme, generating further distress. A recent sociological study by Zona de Securitate and the think tank Watchdog shows that there is more openness towards reintegration in Transnistria after the start of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

(Peter Dench/Getty Images)According to the poll, 45% of people would vote for reintegration with Moldova, while 38% would vote against it, and 17% are undecided, would not answer, or would not vote. Furthermore, 25% of voters from the Russian-occupied left bank voted to entrench the country&apos;s path toward the EU into the constitution during the October referendum. Only 5% voted in favor of the EU in the southern autonomous region of Gagauzia, controlled by Chisinau but having a largely pro-Russian elite and population. It is clear that Moldova cannot rely on Russian gas for its electricity. &quot;We are paying the cost for 30 years of &apos;comfort&apos;,&quot; Serebrian said. According to the International Energy Agency, interconnections with Romania are particularly important for Moldova&apos;s energy security. Chisinau is currently able to import some electricity from Romania via the Vulcanesti-Isaccea electric line, as well as several smaller lines. Three further 400 kilovolt (kV) electric lines are due to be built by the end of 2025, 2026, and 2029. Green energy may provide some relief and independence. Moldova has tripled its solar capacity in the past year, according to the National Centre for Sustainable Energy. But &quot;every country could be doing more to deploy clean energy technologies,&quot; including Moldova, said Tim Gould from the International Energy Agency, &quot;especially since a growing number of these technologies are cost-competitive with fossil fuels and can bring important benefits for energy security.&quot; But market prices may be a lot higher than what Moldovans pay now. &quot;Independence has a cost,&quot; Serebrian said.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-prepares-for-harsh-winter-as-russian-occupied-part-of-country-runs-out-of-gas-2/	2024-12-23T05:59:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188612910-1.jpg
More than two-thirds of Ukrainians favor idea of restoring nuclear arms arsenal, poll shows	About 73% of Ukrainians supported the idea of Ukraine restoring its nuclear weapons, according to a poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology on Dec. 23. The poll was conducted close to the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, under which Ukraine gave up its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal in exchange for international security guarantees. Around half of the respondents said they would support the development of nuclear weapons even at the price of losing Western aid and coming under sanctions. Despite discussions in the media, Kyiv affirmed its adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation policy and said it has no plans of building nuclear weapons, calling for NATO membership as the only viable security guarantee. The pollsters noted that in 1994 only one-third of Ukrainians supported the idea of their state retaining a nuclear arsenal. &quot;In the minds of Ukrainians, nuclear weapons are one of the options &apos;on the table,&apos;&quot; said Anton Hrushetskyi, the institute&apos;s executive director. &quot;We hope that our Western allies will demonstrate the necessary will and Ukraine will eventually receive effective security guarantees, without the need for Ukraine to consider other difficult solutions for itself, how to protect itself from Russia.&quot; The survey was carried out between Dec. 2 and 17 with 2,000 respondents living in Ukraine-controlled territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/73-percent-of-ukrainians-favor-restoring-nuclear-arms-arsenal-poll-shows/	2024-12-23T05:31:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1239393853.jpg
2025 – A Turning Point for Ukraine	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a special edition of the KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter, looking at challenges and opportunities facing Ukraine in 2025. 2025 is gearing up to be a decisive year for Ukraine. The country&#x2019;s leadership will need to navigate a turbulent international landscape, as well as political and military realities that will constrain its options. Here are 5 major trends to watch in the year to come that will shape expectations for the potential end of the Russia-Ukraine war, or move it to its next stage. The &#x201C;Trump 2&#x201D; Presidency: Instability and Isolationism? President-elect Donald Trump has made ending the Russia-Ukraine war a priority &#x2013; but on what terms? His inbound administration counts many Ukraine sceptics and even Russia sympathizers; he is antagonistic towards allies. Encouragingly, both Trump and his Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg seem interested in maintaining or even increasing military support for Ukraine (if only to boost U.S. defense production ahead of potential conflict with China). But the main source of tension is that, ultimately, the U.S. has far fewer ways to pressure Russia than it does Ukraine. Hence, making a deal happen is more likely to happen at the expense of additional Ukrainian concessions, not Russian ones. Providing security guarantees &#x2013; the key Ukrainian demand &#x2013; goes against the general theme of disengagement and isolationism that runs across much of the Trump support base. Although the U.S. is the only power that can provide the kind of guarantees Ukraine needs, a generally hostile approach to allies will make building a coalition of decisive actors more difficult. Kellogg is currently developing a &#x201C;Trump Victory Plan,&#x201D; replacing Zelensky&#x2019;s version (which has failed to find favor with the new U.S. administration). Both Ukraine and its allies will continue to lobby both Kellogg and Trump, including during the former&#x2019;s upcoming Europe trip. Importantly, Russia will likely also try to humor Trump, pretending to engage in diplomacy (possibly also lobbying for a global &#x201C;grand bargain&#x201D;). This would likely be aimed at buying time, tying up aid, and extracting demoralizing concessions. In the end, however, Russia will likely refuse to go forward with any deal that is not devastating to Ukraine and reduces Moscow&#x2019;s ability to re-escalate on its terms. What will Trump do then? Will he find a way to pressure Russia or, more likely, will he get bored, disengage, and blame former President Joe Biden and Zelensky for leaving &#x201C;a mess&#x201D;. Zelensky&#x2019;s growing domestic challenges A potential ceasefire would likely mean an end to martial law and hence elections. But even without a reduction in fighting both Russian propaganda and the incoming U.S. administration are talking about the legitimacy of Ukraine&#x2019;s leadership. This raises the likelihood that 2025 will see both parliamentary and presidential contests. Neither will be easy for Zelensky. Continued economic hardship, mobilization have weighed on the President&#x2019;s support. Opposition forces are mobilizing, mainly with one strategy &#x2013; attacking the incumbent&#x2019;s record. In the short term, this will make it harder for the Zelensky administration to make needed but unpopular decisions. The big question is whether ex-Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi will run. He has shown no inclination, but this may be a poor indicator &#x2013; if he were to run his best strategy is stay quiet and avoid public comments that could betray his lack of political experience. But this is not the only consideration. Zelensky&#x2019;s control of administrative resources and considerable influence over media (including the united TV broadcast and anonymous social media channels) make it tempting to manipulate the playing field (which could harm relations with allies). Additionally, Russia may require that Zelensky doesn&#x2019;t run as the basis of a peace deal (which would probably be counter-productive). Conversely, would he receive an endorsement from Trump? This raises the question of security guarantees for the President and his allies &#x2013; a factor that will impact their decisions and strategy regarding any elections. Finally, given Ukraine&#x2019;s history of revolutions, a third Maidan is a remote possibility &#x2013; most likely led by the military/ nationalist bloc. Neutralizing any such protests risks sparking a backlash and further unrest. Will Ukraine reach a military breaking point? The situation on the battlefield has grown more critical for Ukraine in 2024. The failure of mobilization to address key personnel shortages has left the country struggling to defend itself effectively. Furthermore, a change in the White House has meant that military aid is no longer a certainty, and Europe would struggle to fill this void. The most critical shortage concerns manpower, something that can be partially remedied by Kyiv, albeit at a significant political cost. The current system created a &#x201C;first instance&#x201D; loophole for desertions; lowering the mobilization age could further plug the gap (although it would require additional reform of the system, as the change from 27 to 25 failed to deliver needed results). While critical to avoiding a Ukrainian loss, Western aid has also been unhelpfully organized: new capabilities were often introduced late, at small scale, publicly and out of sync with battlefield needs. The result has more often served to vaccinate the Russian army against Western solutions than it has turned the tide of the war. As a result, changing the dynamics now requires a proportionally greater level of support than previously &#x2013; and likely more than Ukraine&#x2019;s allies are ready for. An alternative option is deploying European boots on the ground, something that is currently politically unpalatable but that may change in 2025. Despite these challenges, Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to withstand Russian aggression &#x2013; even relying solely on its own resources &#x2013; is likely underestimated. Moreover, Kyiv retains the ability to escalate, or threaten to escalate, in asymmetric ways (e.g., attacks against civilian infrastructure in Russia, invading Transnistria, support for Islamic movements in Africa and the Middle East) that will make Western policy-makers uncomfortable and hence unlikely to drop support. The key question is how long Ukraine can delay giving in. The looming Battle of Pokrovsk will likely serve as a litmus test &#x2013; should the loss be fast, say 2 to 3 months, Russia will likely see Ukraine&#x2019;s capabilities as fundamentally degraded and push for tough conditions. Conversely, holding out till summer (in line with incremental gains secured by Russia in 2023-2024), would likely underscore Ukraine&#x2019;s ability to resist until more favorable terms are met. The fragility of democracy: Hybrid war beyond Ukraine Europe surprised many in 2022 when it quickly condemned Russia and strongly supported Ukraine. But sustaining support in 2025 will be more challenging as higher costs of living, &#x201C;accommodating&#x201D; Ukrainian refugees and Russian influence operations will continue to eat away at public support. Ukraine has already witnessed electoral reversals among allies, notably in Slovakia, France, and the U.S. (and, for a moment, in Romania). However, so far, the actual impact on policy has been fairly muted. That may change in 2025, for two reasons. Firstly, the number of relevant elections is much higher &#x2013; Germany, Czechia, Romania, and Poland, among others, will all face key votes. Although more people went to the polls in 2024, this year may more directly impact Ukraine. Secondly, an even more unpredictable social media space increases the likelihood of chaotic outcomes. The case of Romania, where actual Russian interference may have been overstated (vs. actual domestic factors), could be repeated elsewhere &#x2013; and manipulated by Russia. This is hardly an environment in which Ukraine wants to build a coalition of support. Electoral challenges and hybrid operations may not be aimed so much at directly changing outcomes, but also at tying up the energies of key allies. Germany will face federal elections at a time when a clear European voice in negotiations is needed. France, arguably the key security state for Europe, seems engulfed in endless domestic challenges. Doubtless, Russian meddling will also try to slow down Ukraine&#x2019;s European Union accession and frustrate Kyiv (who, in turn, may use this as an excuse to skip the line on various &#x201C;bureaucratic issues&#x201D; that are core to the EU). Importantly, Russia&#x2019;s hybrid war against the West may eventually backfire. Although it has been highlighted by analysts for years, a mainstream response has been lacking. Could this change in 2025? Is this the year that Russia (finally) collapses? The idea of Russia eventually collapsing, or at least running out of munitions, has been around since 2022. More often than not, these analyses point to 2025-2026 as the moment that shortages (of tanks, manpower, shells/ barrels&#x2026; ) start to compound. One of the chief proponents of such a theory is Ukraine&#x2019;s head of Military Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov. He has previously stated expectations that Russia&#x2019;s economy would start to falter and that weapons stocks would begin to run dry over the coming year and a half. While Russia retains options to address its challenges &#x2013; securing men and arms from allies, increasing payments to new recruits&#x2026; &#x2013; these come at increasingly high trade-offs. In particular, record-high interest rates and labor shortages are constraining the Russian economy. The result of shortages is arguably already visible in Syria, where Russia was unable to prop up its ally. Despite surprising resilience, Russia is also suffering from Western sanctions and pressure on third countries that have acted as supply routes has had some impact. The pressure on Russia is undeniably real, but assessing how quickly this will take effect is highly speculative. The big question is who will blink first &#x2013; a Russian regime all-in on destroying Ukraine or Western allies held hostage by opinion polls?	https://kyivindependent.com/2025-a-turning-point-for-ukraine/	2024-12-23T05:24:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Year-ahead--1.png
Zelensky accuses Slovakia's Fico of helping Putin 'fund its war against Ukraine'	President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 23 accused Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico of undermining Europe&apos;s efforts to become independent of Russian gas and helping Moscow to fund its war against Ukraine. Fico met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22 to discuss gas supplies after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal on transiting Russian gas to Europe past Dec. 31. Following the visit, Zelensky lambasted Slovakia&apos;s prime minister in a long post on social media. He called Fico&apos;s Russia visit a &quot;big security issue&quot; for Slovakia and Europe, asking: &quot;Why is this leader so dependent on Moscow? What is being paid to him, and what does he pay with?&quot; &quot;It is worth noting that after their meeting in Moscow, Fico and Putin did not issue joint statements or respond to media questions,&quot; Zelensky said on X. &quot;They simply cannot say publicly anything about what they discussed in the meeting. They are afraid of the public&apos;s reaction.&quot; Under Fico&apos;s leadership, Slovakia took a sharp foreign policy turn, halting military supplies to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks and adopting more Russian-friendly rhetoric. The prime minister has repeatedly made controversial statements on Ukraine and the war that echo the Kremlin&apos;s talking points, gave an interview with Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, and called for the normalization of relations with Russia. The Ukrainian president said that though Moscow provides significant energy discounts to Fico, such discounts are paid &quot;through sovereignty or murky schemes.&quot; Zelensky referred to a recent European meeting in Brussels at which Fico allegedly did not want to participate in a joint effort to find a replacement for Russian gas. According to Ukraine&apos;s head of state, Fico instead wanted to &quot;assist Russia in pushing American gas and energy resources of other partners away from Europe, implying that he wants to help Putin earn money to fund the war and weaken Europe.&quot; &quot;We are losing people as a result of the war that Putin started, and we believe that such assistance to Putin is immoral,&quot; Zelensky concluded. Zelensky also said that Fico refused compensation for the lost profit during the transition period and is &quot;interested specifically in the Russian gas&quot; worth $500 million per year, as well as profits from oil pipe that runs through Ukraine and &quot;gives another $500 million per year.&quot; Fico previously told the media that Zelensky offered him 500 million euros ($520 million) from frozen Russian assets if Bratislava supports Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, an offer the Slovak prime minister said he rejected.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-criticizes-fico/	2024-12-23T04:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/fico.jpg
We don't have to grovel before a mass murderer' — Czechia blasts Fico over Moscow trip	The Czech government&#x2019;s decision to wean itself off from Russian energy ensured that &quot;we don&apos;t have to grovel before a mass murderer,&quot; Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said on Dec. 22, referring to Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico&#x2019;s visit to Moscow. &quot;It was the Czech government that secured independence from Russian energy supplies so that we don&apos;t have to grovel before a mass murderer,&quot; Lipavsky said on X. Fico held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Dec. 22, marking the third visit to Russia by an EU country leader since the start of the full-scale war in 2022. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met Putin in April 2022, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Moscow for talks with the Kremlin&apos;s chief in July 2024. The Slovak prime minister visited Russia&apos;s capital after Kyiv said it would not extend the deal that facilitated the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine to European countries like Slovakia. Both Fico and Orban have consistently criticized Western support for Kyiv and made statements that echoed pro-Russian talking points, while Hungary and Slovakia are ranked among the top European buyers of Russian fossil fuels. The visit comes as another hit to efforts by Ukraine and the West to isolate Putin on the international scene after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held a call with the Russian leader, urging him to call off his invasion. Lithuania&#x2019;s President Gitanas Nauseda also condemned Fico&#x2019;s visit to the Kremlin. &#x201C;How cheap is your love? There are those who come to Russia with love and feel gassed to meet a war criminal,&quot; Nauseda wrote. &quot;This is not Lithuania&apos;s way. We choose energy independence and real market prices &#x2014; with no political strings attached.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-blasts-fico-over-moscow-trip/	2024-12-23T03:58:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2154883507.jpg
Russian cyberattack: Breach occurred at 'top-level account,' MP says	Hackers could have used phishing or bribed employees to breach Justice Ministry registers during a Russian cyberattack last week, Oleksandr Fedienko, head of the parliamentary subcommittee on cybersecurity, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Dec. 23. Phishing is a technique that enables hacking by prompting an employee of the targeted organization to click on a link or download a malicious file disguised as harmless, among others. Behind the scenes of the fierce battles on the front line, Russia and Ukraine are waging a cyberwar, targeting government institutions and strategically important businesses. Fedienko said that the recent cyberattack appeared well-organized, that the attackers had knowledge of the servers&apos; internal architecture, and that the breach occurred at a top-level account. The lawmaker added that the targeted databases had backups and the registers could, therefore, be restored &quot;in a week or two.&quot; First Deputy Justice Minister Mykola Kucheriavenko said on Dec. 22 that the Justice Ministry has faced &quot;serious challenges&quot; after the largest cyberattack in months targeted state registries. Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said the cyberattack on Dec. 19 targeted several government services, including state registers overseen by the Justice Ministry. Officials say the cyberattack had been prepared for months. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) suggested on Dec. 20 that Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) could be behind the cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services. Former Justice Minister Denys Maliuska told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that most of the information Russia stole was &quot;already freely available,&quot; though closed registers were also affected.	https://kyivindependent.com/recent-russian-cyberattack-facilitated-by-top-level-account-mp-says/	2024-12-23T03:29:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/459251170_963204945845598_6558188935354545864_n.jpg
Ukraine receives $1.1 billion from IMF	Ukraine has received a $1.1 billion tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and will direct them to critical budget expenditures, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Dec. 23. The funds come as already the sixth tranche disbursed to Ukraine under the IMF&apos;s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, raising the amount provided so far to $9.8 billion. External financing, such as the $15.6 billion allocated to Ukraine under the EFF over four years, is crucial for Kyiv as its budget is increasingly strained by Russia&apos;s full-scale war. &quot;We are grateful to the International Monetary Fund for its unwavering support for our country during the full-scale war,&quot; Shmyhal said on Telegram. Kyiv received $42.5 billion in foreign aid last year, and the Finance Ministry has said that the amount needs to increase by at least $12 billion for 2025. &quot;Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine continues to take a devastating social and economic toll on Ukraine,&quot; IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a press statement. &quot;Despite the war, macroeconomic stability is being preserved through skillful policymaking by the Ukrainian authorities as well as substantial external support. ... The financial sector remains stable, but vigilance is needed given heightened risks.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-1-billion-from-imf-2/	2024-12-23T02:43:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/imf.jpeg
Cargo vessel sent to transport Russian military equipment from Syria breaks down in open sea, Ukraine's intel claims	The cargo vessel Sparta sent to Syria to bring out Russian military equipment broke down in the open sea and now drifts near the shore of Portugal, Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed in a post on Dec. 23. Concurrently, marine traffic monitors show a Vladivostok-bound cargo ship, Ursa Major, previously registered as Sparta III and visually matching the picture published by HUR, moving at a very low speed of little over 1 knot in the open sea between Spain and Algeria. &quot;The cargo ship Sparta, which Russia sent to transport its weapons and equipment from Syria, broke down during movement. A fuel pipe of the main engine failed,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence claimed. &quot;The Russian crew is trying to fix the problem and (the ship) is drifting in the open sea near Portugal.&quot; Marine traffic monitors show the Ursa Major sailing under the Russian flag and previously making port calls in St. Petersburg. The Kyiv Independent could not verify whether the vessel was sent to Syria to transport Russian military equipment as HUR claims. Russia, the main backer of the recently ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, began evacuating its military stationed in its bases in Syria. &#xA0;According to HUR, Russian military assets in Syria are now limited to two bases: the airbase in Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus. In an earlier statement, the agency claimed that losing the Tartus and Khmeimim bases would significantly damage Russia&apos;s presence in the Middle East and solidify its defeat in the region. According to the agency, the victorious rebel leadership is negotiating with the Kremlin to close their remaining bases in the country no later than February 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-vessel-shipping-russian-equipment-from-syria-breaks-down-ukrainian-intelligence-claims/	2024-12-23T02:21:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/HUR-Sparta.jpg
NATO chief defends Scholz, calls Zelensky's criticism 'unfair'	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told President Volodymyr Zelensky that his sometimes &quot;harsh criticism&quot; of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is unfair, Rutte told the German news agency DPA in comments published on Dec. 23. In the interview, Rutte said that Scholz&apos;s contributions to Ukraine are commendable. The chancellor ensured that Germany ranks second after the U.S. in military support for Ukraine, something Kyiv should also be grateful for, Rutte noted. The NATO chief nevertheless voiced support for supplying Germany&apos;s Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine without any restrictions on their use, a bone of contention between Kyiv and Berlin. Calls for Germany to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles were renewed once the U.S. authorized Ukraine to use its ATACMS long-range missiles against targets in Russia in November. Scholz, who is adamant about not providing Taurus to Ukraine, also recently made headlines by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time after over two years, leading to criticism from Kyiv. &quot;In Europe, it may happen that after one call, there may be a second, third, fourth, fifth... Because sometimes leaders want to (wrestle for) leadership. After that, there may be a wave of actual recognition of Putin,&quot; Zelensky said at the time. &quot;I believe that this does not strengthen Ukraine.&quot; Germany, Ukraine&apos;s main European backer, is currently facing internal turmoil after Scholz lost a confidence vote in the Bundestag on Dec. 16. This paved the way for early parliamentary elections scheduled for Feb. 23. Scholz&#x2019;s opponent, center-right CDU/CSU chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz, has expressed openness to the delivery of Taurus missiles. In the interview, Rutte also said he expects U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to pressure its allies and NATO countries to increase their defense spending. NATO allies reportedly plan to agree on an increase in their defense spending target from 2% to 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP) before their leaders convene for a summit in June 2025. Taking office in January 2025, Trump had hinted at plans to reduce aid for Ukraine and incentivize European countries to pay more for their protection. The Financial Times recently reported that while the incoming U.S. president told European partners he would not abandon Ukraine, he also called for raising the defense spending benchmark to 5% of GDP. Some European NATO countries have yet to reach 2%, while Poland, the biggest spender, is expected to invest 4.7% of its GDP in defense in 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-defends-scholz-calls-zelenskys-criticism-unfair/	2024-12-23T01:49:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2157094594.jpg
Moscow begins providing energy aid to Georgia's Russian-occupied Abkhazia region	Russia has begun providing electricity aid to Georgia&apos;s Russian-held Abkhazia region amid a major energy crisis, local authorities told the Russian TASS news agency on Dec. 23. The press service of the Abkhaz energy company Chernomorenergo reported that a schedule from Nov. 1, under which electricity will be unavailable for four hours per day, is in effect. The region has previously faced energy shutdowns for nine-to-11 hours per day, prompting its acting head, Badra Gunba, to appeal to Russia for support on Dec. 21. The crisis was aggravated by a spat between Abkhazia and Moscow that broke out after the local council voted against a controversial investment agreement with Russia following popular protests. Soon after, Russia cut almost all funding to Abkhazia, including money crucial for the region&apos;s energy sector. The region lost all electricity for a day on Dec. 11 after the Enguri hydroelectric power station shut down due to a low water level in a nearby reservoir. Russia has occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. Both regions are internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-begins-providing-energy-aid-to-georgias-occupied-abkhazia-region/	2024-12-23T01:09:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2173673388.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 3 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least three civilians and injured at least three others over the past day, regional authorities reported on Dec. 23. The Russian military attacked Ukraine with 72 Shahed-type drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles overnight on Dec. 23, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported on Telegram. Ukrainian air defense shot down 47 drones over nine oblasts while 25 drones were lost in the airspace, the Air Force said. A 56-year-old man was injured in a drone attack on Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on this Telegram channel. The victim was in a serious condition. Three people were killed, and one was injured after the Russian military attacked 28 cities and villages in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. A gas pipe, shops, and cars were also damaged. One person was injured in Khmelnytskyi Oblast following an attack by Shahed drones, regional authorities reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-4/	2024-12-23T00:40:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Australian citizen fighting for Ukraine allegedly captured by Russia	The Australian government is investigating reports that Russian forces captured an Australian citizen fighting for Ukraine, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Dec. 23. The man, who identifies himself as 32-year-old Australian Oscar Jenkins, is seen in military fatigues being violently interrogated in a video shared on Russian Telegram channels. The interrogator behind the camera is seen hitting the captive over the head while questioning him in Russian about his identity. The footage was first shared by Russian military correspondent Alexander Sladkov on Dec. 22. &quot;I&#x2019;m Australian... Oscar Jenkins, 32 years old. Live in Australia and Ukraine,&quot; Jenkins responded in English with a native accent and in broken Ukrainian. The man introduces himself as a biology teacher who wanted to help Ukraine and is now based near Kramatorsk, a Ukrainian city in Donetsk Oblast, around 700 kilometers (430 miles) east of Kyiv and 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line. The Sydney Morning Herald confirmed Jenkins&apos; identity as a Melbourne man who studied biology and lived in China since 2015. Australian officials said they are working to confirm Jenkins&apos;s whereabouts and contacting Russian authorities. &quot;We urge the Russian Government to fully adhere to its obligations under international humanitarian law, including with respect to prisoners of war,&quot; Australia&apos;s acting Foreign Minister and Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said. &quot;Our immediate priority is understanding where Mr Jenkins is and confirming his wellbeing.&quot; Australia&apos;s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that the Australian embassy in Moscow is trying to obtain all the details regarding Jenkins but warned that &quot;we know that the Russians often put out information that isn&#x2019;t right.&quot; Russia is believed to focus on capturing foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine, who it presents as &quot;mercenaries&quot; without a right for protection, for potential prisoner swaps. Citizens from dozens of countries have come to Ukraine to help the country resist Russian aggression, mostly joining the International Legion. In November, Russian forces captured James Scott Rhys Anderson, a former British soldier fighting for Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/australian-citizen-fighting-for-ukraine-allegedly-captured-by-russia/	2024-12-23T00:01:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1089926858--1-.jpg
Russia's threat to Europe 'much wider than we imagine,' Italian PM warns	Russia&#x2019;s threat to Europe extends beyond defense to illegal immigration and cybersecurity, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Dec. 22 during an international meeting in Finland. &quot;It&apos;s about our democracy, it&apos;s about influencing our public opinion, it&apos;s about what happens in Africa, it&apos;s about raw materials, it&apos;s about the instrumentalization of migration. We need to know it&apos;s a very wide idea of security,&quot; Meloni was quoted as saying by Reuters. Russia and Belarus have been orchestrating an influx of migrants since 2021, letting thousands of asylum seekers to the European Union&#x2019;s eastern borders with a pledge of safe entry into the EU. In November 2021, Belarusian troops escorted thousands of asylum seekers to the Polish border, cutting through the wire fence to allow refugees to cross. Most of them were violently pushed back by Polish border guards who set up a no-access zone at the border for nine months. Italy&apos;s right-wing prime minister urged the EU to view migration as a distributive problem as well as a security one. &quot;Security also means critical infrastructure, it means artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, raw materials, supply chains. It means a new and more effective foreign and cooperation policy, it means migration,&quot; Meloni said. Meloni cautioned against complacency in the EU, adding that even after Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine ends, its security challenge will not go away. &quot;We have to understand the threat is much wider than we imagine,&quot; Meloni said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-threat-to-europe-much-wider-than-we-imagine-italian-pm-warns/	2024-12-22T23:30:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189976147-1.jpg
Mysterious' fire engulfs Russian Shahed warehouse, Ukrainian intelligence claims	A &quot;devastating&quot; fire broke out at a Shahed drone warehouse at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan, destroying drone parts worth $16 million, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Dec. 23. The Alabuga Special Economic Zone hosts the Yelabuga drone factory that produces Shahed-type drones for the Russian military, located more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. According to HUR, the affected warehouse stored 65 drone attack fuselages, as well as engines, navigation systems, and thermal imaging cameras for the production of 400 Shahed-type drones. &quot;Everything burned down,&quot; the agency said without explicitly claiming responsibility for the &quot;mysterious, devastating fire.&quot; Ukrainian intelligence agencies have been previously linked to a number of assassinations and sabotage operations deep in the Russian rear during the full-scale war. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. &quot;HUR reminds that there will be fair retribution for every war crime committed against the Ukrainian people,&quot; the intelligence agency said in a statement. Local authorities did not report any fire or similar incident in the Alabuga zone overnight on Dec. 23. Drones struck Kazan, Tatarstan&apos;s regional center, on the morning of Dec. 21, damaging several buildings but reportedly inflicting no casualties. The Yelabuga drone factory was launched in July 2023, aiming to produce not only Russian equivalents of Iranian-made Shahed drones but also the Albatross reconnaissance drones. Russia regularly employs Shaheds and its domestic-made variants like Geran for strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Ukrainian long-range drones previously struck the Yelabuga facility in early April.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-engulfs-russian-shahed-warehouse-ukrainian-intel-says/	2024-12-22T22:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 776,090 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 776,090 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 23. This number includes 1,990 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,615 tanks, 19,885 armored fighting vehicles, 32,039 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,313 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,030 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,790 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-776-090-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-22T22:12:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188757384.jpg
North Korea preparing to ship more troops, drones to Russia, Seoul says	North Korea is preparing to deploy additional troops and weapons, including kamikaze drones, to aid Russia in its full-scale war against Ukraine, the South Korean military said on Dec. 23. Thousands of North Korean personnel are already stationed in Russia. In recent days, North Korean soldiears have begun engaging in assault operations alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. South Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) believe that Pyongyang is now planning to send additional military support, the Yonhap news agency reported. &quot;A comprehensive assessment of multiple intelligence shows that North Korea is preparing to rotate or increase the deployment of troops (in Russia), while currently supplying 240 millimeter rocket launchers and 170 millimeter self-propelled artillery,&quot; the JCS said. &quot;There are also some signs of (the North) moving to manufacture and supply suicide drones, first unveiled during Kim Jong Un&apos;s on-site inspection in November.&quot; By deepening military cooperation with Moscow, Pyongyang hopes to gain practical battlefield experience and the ability to modernize its weapons systems, the JCS said. North Korea has emerged as Russia&apos;s leading ally in the full-scale war against Ukraine, providing not only ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition but also soldiers. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack. After reporting initial but limited clashes with North Korean troops in the fall, Ukraine in December announced that Russia had begun using North Korean units in ground assaults. South Korean officials have reported that at least 100 North Korean soldiers have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine. According to lawmaker Lee Sung-kwon, North Korean troops are suffering high casualty rates in part due to their inexperience with drone warfare. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is attempting to hide information about North Korean casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-preparing-to-ship-more-troops-drones-to-russia-seoul-says/	2024-12-22T21:49:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
BMW dismisses employees involved in scheme to illegally deliver cars to Russia	The German automaker BMW on Dec. 22 announced that it had uncovered irregularites in car exports from its Hanover branch to Russia and subsequently dismissed employees who were involved. The announcement confirms a report from the news outlet Business Insider, said that over 100 luxury cars had been delivered to Russian buyers despite ongoing sanctions. BMW discovered irregularities that allowed cars to be transferred to Russia from its Hanover branch, the company said in a statement, as reported by Deutsche Welle. The automaker has since suspended sales of the vehicles. &quot;In addition, the BMW Group has decided to dismiss the employees who bear the greatest responsibility for this,&quot; the company said. The U.S. and the E.U. banned the export of high-end automobiles to Russia in March 2022, in the aftermath of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Cars from Europe have nonetheless continued to enter Russia through a variety of schemes to circumvent the ban. Russia&apos;s luxury car imports fell sharply after sanctions were first imposed, but shipments resumed in 2023, largely via intermediaries in third-party countries. BMW is taking steps to prevent illegal exports of its products to Russia via third parties and to fully comply with international sanctions, the company said.	https://kyivindependent.com/bmw-dismisses-employees-involved-in-scheme-to-illegally-deliver-cars-to-russia/	2024-12-22T20:38:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162698459.jpg
Trump names 5 picks for Pentagon jobs	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 22 announced five nominees for high-level positions at the Pentagon, including deputy defense secretary. Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, and has begun selecting nominees for top positions in his cabinet from among his loyal supporters. His picks are subject to Senate confirmation hearings. &#xA0; The president-elect named billionaire investor Stephen Feinberg as his pick for deputy defense secretary. Feinberg has no previous Pentagon experience, but has been a major financial backer of Trump&apos;s presidential campaigns. Feinberg will &quot;help Make the Pentagon Great Again,&quot; Trump said via the social media platform Truth Social on Dec. 22. Trump also tapped Elbridge Colby for under-secretary for policy, Michael Duffey for undersecretary for acquisitions and sustainment, Emil Michael for undersecretary for research and engineering, and Keith Bass for assistant secretary for health affairs. Colby, who served in the Pentagon during Trump&apos;s first term, has said that he does not support Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO but does endorse increasing sanctions against Russia. Colby will work &quot;to restore our Military power, and achieve my policy of PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,&quot; Trump said. Duffey, another former Trump administration official, played a key role in an international incident involving Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. Duffey asked the Pentagon to halt millions of dollars in scheduled military aid to Ukraine following a 2019 phone call between Zelensky and Trump, during which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden as a &quot;favor.&quot; The infamous call led to Trump&apos;s first impeachment. &quot;Mike will drive change at the Pentagon and, as a staunch proponent of an America First approach to our National Defense, will work to revitalize our Defense Industrial Base, and rebuild our Military,&quot; Trump said. Emil Michael is a former executive at Uber, while Keith Bass is a retired Navy commander. Trump shocked Pentagon officials when he named Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his choice for U.S. defense secretary on Nov. 12. Hegseth lacks military leadership experience and has been accused of sexual assault and alcohol abuse. Reuters reported on Nov. 13 that Trump&apos;s team is planning additional shake-ups at the Pentagon, possibly including dismissals of several military officers. Mr. Trump named Stephen A. Feinberg as his choice for deputy secretary of defense, Elbridge Colby to be under secretary for policy, Michael Duffey for under secretary for acquisitions and sustainment and Emil Michael as under secretary for research and engineering. All should face Senate confirmation hearings.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-names-5-picks-for-pentagon-jobs/	2024-12-22T19:19:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185636867.jpg
Putin threatens 'more destruction' for Ukraine after Kazan drone strike	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 22 threatened Ukraine with &quot;more destruction&quot; after drones struck several buildings in the Russian city of Kazan the previous day. Drones hit residential buildings in Kazan, located in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan region, the morning of Dec. 21. The strike shattered windows in a high-rise apartment complex, but there were no reported casualties. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack. &quot;Whoever, and however much they try to destroy, they will face many times more destruction themselves and will regret what they are trying to do in our country,&quot; Putin said in a video address to the local leader of Tatarstan on Dec. 22. The comment comes a few days after Putin on Dec. 19 threatened to launch Russia&apos;s Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) at Kyiv to test Western air defenses. Previously, Putin claimed Russia planned to target &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles. The drone attack on Kazan, which lies about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the Ukrainian border, prompted school evacuations and temporary suspension of flights at nearby airports. Officials in Tatarstan reported that of the eight drones that attacked Kazan, six struck luxury apartment buildings, one hit an industrial facility, and one was shot down. Kyiv has targeted military and industrial facilities in Russia with drone strikes in an attempt to reduce Moscow&apos;s capacity to launch long-range weapons and finance its full-scale war against Ukraine. Russian aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities escalated sharply in the fall of 2024. Drone strikes surged to record levels in October and November, and Russia dropped at least 100 guided bombs per day nearly every day between Nov. 1-20. Civilian casualties from Russian missiles and aerial bombs increased significantly in 2024 compared to the previous year, the U.N. reported. A Russian guided aerial bomb struck an oncology center in Kherson overnight on Dec. 21. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack &quot;a heinous act of cruelty.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-threatens-more-destruction-for-ukraine-after-kazan-drone-strike/	2024-12-22T17:30:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1246324907.jpg
Putin, Slovak PM discuss gas transit, standardizing 'mutual relations,' Fico says after Kremlin meeting	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed gas transit, the war in Ukraine, and standardizing &quot;mutual relations&quot; between Russia and Slovakia during their meeting on Dec. 22, Fico said. Fico held talks with Putin at the Kremlin on Dec. 22 during a visit to Moscow. The meeting with Putin was &quot;a response&quot; to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s refusal to extend the transit of Russian gas supplies to the European Union via Ukraine, Fico said in a Facebook post following the meeting. &quot;Putin confirmed the readiness of the Russian Federation to continue supplying gas to the West and Slovakia, which is practically impossible given the position of the Ukrainian president after Jan. 1, 2025,&quot; Fico wrote. An agreement to allow the transit of gas from Russia to Europe via Ukraine is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2024. Zelensky confirmed on Dec. 19 that Kyiv will not extend the deal. &quot;We will not engage in extending the transit of Russian gas. We will not give (Russia) the opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood,&quot; Zelensky said. Fico criticized the decision, warning of a looming gas crisis. Within days, he traveled to Moscow in his first visit since his 2023 reelection. His trip represents the third time a European leader has visited Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In his comments following the meeting, Fico also criticized Zelensky&apos;s support for sanctions against Russia&apos;s nuclear program. &quot;With such positions, (Zelensky) is financially damaging Slovakia and threatening the production of electricity in nuclear power plants in Slovakia, which is unacceptable,&quot; he said. According to Fico, he and Putin went on to discuss the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Bratislava. &quot;In a long conversation ... Putin and I exchanged views on the military situation in Ukraine, the possibilities of an early peaceful end to the war, and on mutual relations between the Slovak Republic and the Russian Federation, which I intend to standardize,&quot; he wrote. Fico, who heads the Slovak government for the fourth time in his political career, has been a vocal opponent of military aid for Ukraine and has close ties to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, another Central European populist leader with friendly attitudes toward Putin. Slovakia and Hungary are both heavily reliant on Russian gas, despite the EU&apos;s efforts to wean itself from Russian fossil fuels amid the full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s decision to let the transit agreement expire prompted the state-owned energy companies of Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Austria to issue a joint declaration calling for the continuation of gas transit. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. Fico said in October that he hopes to resume &quot;economic and standard relations&quot; between Russia and Slovakia after the war in Ukraine ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-slovak-pm-discuss-gas-transit-standardizing-mutual-relations-fico-says-after-kremlin-meeting/	2024-12-22T16:13:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ficoputin2-6.png
Trump claims Putin wants to meet with him 'as soon as possible'	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 22 said that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to hold a meeting with him &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Trump delivered the remarks to conservative activisits at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, where he celebrated his victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election. &quot;President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible,&quot; Trump claimed. &quot;So we have to wait for this. But we need to end that horrible, horrible war.&quot; Trump emphasized the heavy military losses incurred in the war and repeated his claims that Russia would not have launched the full-scale &#xA0;invasion if he had been president in 2022. &quot;Millions of soldiers have died,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve got to stop it, it&apos;s ridiculous. That war would have never happened if I was president.&quot; Earlier this week, Putin on Dec. 19 said that he was prepared to meet with Trump at &quot;any time&quot; to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Trump will take office on Jan 20, 2025. His return to the White House is expected to mark a significant shift in U.S. policy on Ukraine, with a focus on pressuring Kyiv to make a deal with Moscow. President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Trump on Dec. 7 in Paris, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, in the leaders&apos; first in-person meeting since the election. Zelensky reported that he praised Trump during the meeting, telling him he was the only one Putin feared. Following the meeting with Zelensky, Trump said the Ukrainian president appeared ready &quot;to make a deal and stop the madness&quot; and that Putin should do the same after incurring staggering losses in Ukraine. Trump has nominated retired general Keith Kellogg as his special Ukrainian peace envoy, tasked with leading negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Kellogg is expected to visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. Kellogg previously co-authored a peace plan that would freeze the front line in Ukraine, take NATO&apos;s accession off the table for an extended period, and partially lift sanctions imposed on Russia. The plan would also cut off military aid to Ukraine unless Kyiv agreed to enter negotiations. The Financial Times reported on Dec. 20 that despite these proposals, Trump intends to continue sending U.S. weapons to Ukraine when he becomes president.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-putin-wants-to-meet-with-him-as-soon-as-possible/	2024-12-22T14:44:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190485862.jpg
Suspilne: more than 1000 applications submitted to join Ukrainian Legion in Poland	Over one thousand applications have been submitted to the Ukrainian Legion in Poland, Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar said in an interview with Suspilne on Dec. 22. The first contracts with the Ukrainian Armed Forces were signed in November, and the next recruitment phase is set for early January. Bodnar highlighted Poland&apos;s robust support for basic military training, followed by specialized training based on the soldier&apos;s role. After training, recruits are assigned to relevant military units in Ukraine, where they operate under direct command. &#x201C;Poland is a country that is quite seriously helping Ukraine, because it understands that this is a strategic interest for it, for all of Europe, and it is a country that sympathizes with Ukraine with all these terrible events that we are currently experiencing during the almost three years of ongoing war,&#x201D; Bodnar said. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first volunteer recruitment center was opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in the eastern Polish city of Lublin. The unit is part of an effort to replenish the ranks of Ukraine&apos;s military as the all-out war with Russia continues into its third year.	https://kyivindependent.com/suspilne-more-than-1000-applications-submitted-to-join-ukrainian-legion-in-poland/	2024-12-22T13:28:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160543138.jpg
New IMF forecast predicts war in Ukraine ending in late 2025 or 2026	The International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s (IMF) updated projections for Ukraine outline two scenarios regarding Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war. The baseline scenario assumes the war will end by late 2025, while the downside scenario predicts it will continue until mid-2026, significantly affecting economic stability. Under the baseline scenario, Ukraine&#x2019;s GDP is expected to grow by 4% in 2024, an increase from earlier forecasts, and inflation is projected to rise to 10% due to factors like rising food prices and currency depreciation. The IMF notes that investments in electricity generation and European imports have mitigated the effects of winter energy shortages. For 2025, GDP growth is forecast at 2.5-3.5%, reflecting improved energy capacity and rising income levels amid easing price pressures. In the downside scenario, a prolonged war would cause deeper economic shocks, including slower GDP recovery, higher inflation, and fiscal deficits exceeding 20% until 2026. This scenario estimates an external financing gap of $177.2 billion, compared to $148 billion under the baseline, with international reserves remaining below IMF criteria until 2027. On December 21, the IMF completed its sixth review of Ukraine&apos;s Extended Fund Facility, approving an additional $1.1 billion tranche. The program will provide Kyiv with $15.6 billion in budget support over four years. Including the latest round of funding, the IMF has already disbursed $9.8 billion.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-imf-forecast-predicts-war-in-ukraine-ending-in-late-2025-or-2026/	2024-12-22T12:21:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171755093.jpg
Ukraine war latest: For the first time, Ukraine attacks Russian positions using solely ground, FPV drones	Key developments on Dec. 21-22: Ukrainian forces successfully attacked Russian positions using only ground and first person view (FPV) drones instead of infantry, an army spokesperson claimed on Dec. 20. Speaking on national TV, Sergeant Volodymyr Dehtiarov, spokesperson for the Khartiia Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, said &#x201C;dozens of units of robotic and unmanned equipment&#x201D; supported by surveillance drones were used in the assault near the village of Lyptsi, north of Kharkiv. Dehtiarov said the drones included ground systems equipped with machine guns, and kamikaze FPV drones. He did not specify when the attack took place. Commenting on the reports, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the attack highlighted the difference in attitude towards front line troops shown by Moscow and Kyiv. &quot;Ukrainian officials have repeatedly highlighted Ukraine&apos;s efforts to utilise technological innovations and asymmetric strike capabilities to offset Ukraine&apos;s manpower limitations in contrast with Russia&apos;s willingness to accept unsustainable casualty rates for marginal territorial gains,&quot; the ISW said. Russian military losses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine have exceeded 750,000 Russian soldiers, and are expected to surpass 1 million Russian troops within six months, U.K. Under-Secretary of Defense Luke Pollard said on Dec. 19. The U.K.&apos;s latest estimate is in line with figures from Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, which, as of Dec. 19, sits at 768,220 troops lost since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. &quot;It is highly likely that they have sustained significant combat casualties, whilst only achieving limited tactical gains,&quot; Pollard told British parliamentarians on Dec. 19. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian losses exceeded 45,000 troops and $3 billion worth of equipment in November. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine is developing numerous new types of drone systems. Military tech developers created a new unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with the ability to carry explosives and drive under armored vehicles, the project&apos;s spokesperson, Viktoriia Kovalchuk, told Business Insider on Oct. 25. The UGV, named Ratel S or Honey Badger, was developed as part of the Brave1 government initiative. The initiative was launched in April to invest in defense tech innovations that can be utilized by the Ukrainian military, as well as serve as a platform to connect the industry&apos;s stakeholders. &quot;The main idea is that the robot (Ratel S) is used as a mobile warhead that carries anti-tank mines or other explosive devices,&quot; said Kovalchuk, adding that it can run for 40&#x2013;50 minutes at an average speed or for up to two hours at a slower speed. Over 12,340 civilian deaths have been recorded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) Izumi Nakamitsu said during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Dec. 20. The U.N. report on casualties comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates threats against Ukrainian cities, including threatening on Dec. 19 to launch an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded civilian casualties in Ukraine from Feb. 24, 2022 to Nov. 30, 2024, Nakamitsu said. Over 12,340 civilians were killed and more than 27,836 were wounded during that period. The U.N. found that in 2024, aerial bombs and long-range weapons caused a greater number of casualties than in the previous year, Nakamitsu said. Aerial bombs killed 341 civilians and wounded 1,803 between Jan. 1 and Nov. 30, according to data from the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. The figures represent a threefold increase in deaths and sixfold increase in injuries from 2023. The OHCHR also found that 42% of Ukrainian civilian casualties in the month of November resulted from Russian attacks with long-range weapons, a &quot;significant increase&quot; from prior months. Russia intensified aerial strikes against densely populated Ukrainian cities in October and November 2024. Drone strikes surged to record levels and Russia dropped at least 100 guided bombs per day nearly every day between Nov. 1-20. Repeated attacks against residential neighborhoods in large cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, and Sumy, led to high numbers of killed and injured victims. Russia on Nov. 21 launched an Oreshnik missile against the city of Dnipro, supposedly as a response to the U.S. and the U.K. lifting restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia. Putin has since used threats of Oreshnik strikes to intimidate Ukraine and scare off Western support for Kyiv. Nakamitsu said that Russia&apos;s escalating attacks are cause for &quot;grave concerns.&quot; An airport in the Russian city of Kazan has suspended flights after Ukrainian drones hit several buildings, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Dec. 21. According to the outlet, eight drones attacked the city in the morning hours, with five of them hitting residential buildings across three districts of the city. Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported that four of the eight drones crashed into two high-rise residential buildings and one into a low-rise residential building. Russian state media Kommersant reported that the airports of both Kazan and the neighboring city of Izhevsk had suspended flights. The Kazan mayor&apos;s office has said that schools have been &quot;selectively&quot; evacuated, according to Meduza. No casualties have been reported at this time. Russian state media outlet Tass reported that a drone attempting to attack an industrial plant &quot;missed its target,&quot; according to the press service of the governor of Tatarstan, the republic in which Kazan is located. Kyiv has intensified its drone strike campaign on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. On Nov. 25, drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) struck an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga. These attacks follow Ukraine&apos;s first use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia and subsequent launches of UK-made Shadow missiles, made possible after Washington eased long-range attack restrictions. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on December 22, according to the state-owned TASS news agency. This marked his first visit to Moscow since returning to power in 2023. The trip was reportedly planned a few days earlier, with discussions likely centered on Russian gas supplies, though details will emerge after the meeting. Fico becomes the third European leader to visit Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, following Austria&#x2019;s Karl Nehammer and Hungary&#x2019;s Viktor Orb&#xE1;n. This visit comes as Slovakia seeks to secure a gas supply deal for 2024, despite Ukraine&apos;s firm stance against renewing its gas transit agreement with Gazprom. At a prior European Union summit, Fico criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s position, saying, &quot;We are demonstrably facing a gas crisis thanks to President Zelensky.&quot; Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. The Justice Ministry has faced &quot;serious challenges&quot; after the largest cyberattack in months targeted state registries, but a full restoration is expected within two weeks, First Deputy Justice Minister Mykola Kucheryavenko said on Dec. 22. In comments to the Kyiv Independent, Kucheryavenko said that the precise date of the full restoration of the registries would be more clear in the coming days. &quot;The aggressor&apos;s actions were aimed at destabilizing the work of the state registries,&quot; Kucheryavenko said. &quot;The goals of the attack were not achieved.&quot; The cyberattack targeted several government services on Dec. 19, including state registers overseen by the Justice Ministry, Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said. Officials say the cyberattack had been prepared for months. Ukraine launched a criminal investigation. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) suggested on Dec. 20 Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) could be behind the cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services. The former Justice Minister, Denys Maliuska, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that the majority of the information Russia stole was &quot;already freely available,&quot; though closed a register were also affected. &quot;This is one of the most closed register where information is stored, in which there is no secret, it would seem &#x2014; that someone was born or married,&quot; Maliuska told Ukrainska Pravda. &quot;But at the same time, there is a secret that is strictly protected by law &#x2014; the secret of adoption,&quot; he added. Kucheryavenko said that &quot;preliminary estimates no information from the registries has been lost,&quot; adding that the ministry has backup copies of the data. Behind the scenes of the fierce battles on the front line, both sides are fighting a cyberwarfare crucial to the war efforts.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-for-the-first-time-ukraine-attacks-russian-positions-using-solely-ground-fpv-drones/	2024-12-22T11:34:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1574618594.jpg

Ombudsman reacts to alleged Russian execution of Ukrainian POWs	Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reacted to a video allegedly showing Russian troops executing Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) on Dec. 22, vowing to report &quot;another crime&quot; to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to seek justice. &quot;The video shows how Russian soldiers shot five captured Ukrainian defenders,&quot; Lubinets said in a Telegram post, referring to drone footage released by the 110th Mechanized Brigade earlier on Dec. 22 that appears to have captured Russian troops shooting surrendered Ukrainian soldiers from behind. One of the press officers of the 110th, Ivan Sekach, told the Ukrainian media outlet NV that Russian troops had shot four encircled Ukrainian soldiers dead. Another two, he said, were already killed by shelling earlier. He said that the incident took place on the Velyka Novosilka axis in the eastern Donetsk Oblast, where Russian troops have recently intensified their push. Throughout the full-scale war in Ukraine, the visual evidence of Russian troops executing Ukrainian soldiers mounts, showing a stark violation of the Geneva Conventions. It is however difficult to prove such apparent war crimes to the international court, as retrieving such bodies is often impossible. The 110th brigade suffered a similar incident in February when its troops were withdrawing from the small industrial city of Avdiivka in Donetsk Oblast. Two soldiers who barely escaped encirclement told the Kyiv Independent how six of their comrades, who were unable to flee on foot due to their injuries, were shot dead by Russian troops, citing videos that surfaced on the internet. The 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade confirmed in a Feb. 19 statement that five soldiers were killed, and the fate of the last one was uncertain. Yurii Belousov, the head of the department focused on war-related crimes, said in October that Kyiv is aware of 93 POWs who were executed by Russian soldiers across the full-scale war. The number has since passed to include over 100 such cases.	https://kyivindependent.com/ombudsman-reacts-to-alleged-russian-execution-of-ukrainian-pows/	2024-12-22T08:58:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-22-at-18_06_00.png

At least one killed, 10 wounded by Russian attacks over past day, local authorities say	At least one person was killed, and 10 were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 22. In the southern Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said that one person was killed and six, including a child, were wounded as of the morning of Dec. 22. He said that Russian troops struck the western bank of the Dnipro River with glide bombs and artillery, in addition to launching a ballistic missile strike in the Kherson area. In the central Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak said that the city of Nikopol and its surrounding areas came under heavy fire throughout the day on Dec. 21. Three were wounded yesterday, including a 16-year-old boy, according to the official. In the eastern Donetsk Oblast, where the fiercest fighting rages on, Russian attacks on front-line areas led to one injury in the city of Pokrovsk, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. The reports of casualties come as Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported shooting down 52 attack drones, including the Shahed type, that Russia launched against the country overnight. It added that it lost track of 44 decoy drones that Russia launched alongside the real attack drones. One drone flew toward Belarus, according to the report. The Air Force said that there were no casualties reported yet from the drone strikes. Russia continues to indiscriminately attack civilian areas regardless of their proximity to the front line, often targeting critical infrastructure to deprive people of electricity, gas, and water.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-one-killed-10-wounded-by-russian-attacks-over-past-day-local-authorities-say/	2024-12-22T05:34:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kherson-1.jpeg
Air Force reports downing 52 Russian drones overnight	Ukraine shot down 52 attack drones, including the Shahed type, that Russia launched against the country overnight, the Air Force reported on Dec. 22. The Air Force added that it lost track of 44 decoy drones that Russia launched alongside the real attack drones. One drone flew away toward Belarus, according to the report. Over the past several months, Russia has intensified its drone attacks across Ukraine, often targeting critical infrastructure to deprive civilians of power, water, and gas. On Dec. 22, drones were shot down over 12 Ukrainian oblasts, such as Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia, the Air Force reported. Apartment buildings and private businesses are among the sites damaged due to the Russian attacks, according to the Air Force. No casualties have been reported thus far, it added. Russia is launching about 10 times as many Shahed-type drones against Ukraine compared to last fall, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in November. The Air Force has reported a sharp rise in Russia&apos;s drone attacks, from 2,023 drones deployed in October to 2,576 in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/air-force-reports-downing-52-russian-drones-overnight/	2024-12-22T02:40:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg

Media identifies nearly 85,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Journalists have identified the names of 84,761 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona. Since the media outlets&apos; last update in early December, the names of 2,711 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. According to the outlets&apos; conclusions for the year, 2024 will likely mark the &quot;war&apos;s deadliest year,&quot; with a current count of over 20,000 confirmed deaths over the past 12 months &#x2014; although final conclusions cannot yet be made as data on casualties continues to emerge. The confirmed figures comes as the U.K. announced its casualty estimates earlier in the week, estimating that Russian losses have exceeded 750,000 Russian soldiers, and are expected to surpass 1 million Russian troops within six months. The U.K.&apos;s latest estimate are in line with figures from Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, which, as of Dec. 21, sits at 772,280 troops lost since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian losses exceeded 45,000 troops and $3 billion worth of equipment in November. Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identifies-nearly-85-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-12-21T19:15:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1249450973.jpg
Fire reported at oil depot in Russia's Oryol Oblast amid drone attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Ukrainian drones reportedly struck an oil depot in the suburbs of the Russian city of Oryol overnight on Dec. 22, causing a fire to break out, Oryol Oblast Governor Andrey Klychkov said. Multiple explosions were reported in the city around 12:30 p.m. local time, according to Russian Telegram news channel Astra. Videos posted on social media and shot by local residents show large explosions lighting up the night sky around the city. The extent of the damage caused was not immediately clear. Klychkov claimed that no casualties or injuries had been reported as a result of the attack. The Kyiv Independent cannot verify the claims made by Russian officials and Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. The attack comes just one week after Ukrainian drones struck the same oil depot in Oryol causing a large fire to break out. The fire reportedly burned for several days following the attack. Over the past year, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, which is crucial to sustain Moscow&apos;s war efforts, as well as its military hardware. As Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion continues, Ukraine has also continued to attack Russian targets along the Russia-Ukraine border to inflict damage to the country&apos;s military supply chain. Earlier on Dec. 21, Ukrainian drones reportedly attacked the Russian city of Kazan, located over 1,000 km from the Russia-Ukraine border. The drones hit several buildings and suspended flights in the local airport.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-reported-at-oil-depot-in-russias-oryol-oblast-amid-ukrainian-drone-attack/	2024-12-21T17:57:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Volga_river__Saratov_Oil_Refinery_P5161319_2200.jpg
Ukrainian boxer Usyk defeats Fury to retain heavyweight championship belt	Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk defeated U.K.-born Tyson Fury by unanimous decision in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Dec. 22 to retain his unified heavyweight championship title. The victory, which all judges scored 116-112, comes amid a highly anticipated rematch of a bout that Usyk also won in May. With his victory, Usyk has been undefeated in all of his 23 professional fights. Following his victory, Usyk dedicated his victory to his mother, &quot;and to all the mothers of Ukraine.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky also congratulated Usyk following his victory, adding that Usyk&apos;s win was &quot;so needed by all of us right now.&quot; &quot;By keeping his championship belts, Oleksandr proves: we are Ukrainians and we will not give up what is ours. And no matter how hard it was &#x2013; we will overcome. Whether it&apos;s the ring, the battlefield, or the diplomatic arena &#x2013; we fight and we won&#x2019;t give up what is ours,&quot; Zelensky wrote on social media. In a symbolic move following his victory, Usyk, originally from Crimea, raised a 17th century sabre once owned by Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa. The sabre, preserved in the Chernihiv Historical Museum, was carefully transported to Riyadh through the Oleksandr Usyk Charitable Foundation and Ukraine WOW. After the match, U.K. boxer Daniel Dubois and International Boxing Federation (IBF) heavyweight champion entered the ring and challenged Usyk to a bout for Usyk&apos;s championship title. Before becoming a professional boxer in 2013, Usyk competed as an amateur boxer with a record of 335 wins and 15 losses. He was crowned Olympic gold medalist in men&apos;s heavyweight boxing at the 2012 London Games.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-boxer-usyk-defeats-fury-to-retain-heavyweight-champion-belt/	2024-12-21T16:19:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/gettyimages-2190993992-612x612.jpg
Russian attack on cancer treatment center in Kherson 'heinous act of cruelty against civilians,' Zelensky says	Russia&apos;s attack on an oncology center in the city of Kherson overnight on Dec. 21 &quot;was nothing less than a heinous act of cruelty against civilians,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address. Russian forces struck an oncology center with two guided aerial bombs, the Kherson Regional Military Administration reported. In his evening address, Zelensky said that there were no casualties as a result of the attack on the medical facility as patients and medical staff sought shelter. The oncology center, which has operated in a limited capacity since the start of the full-scale invasion, housed the only linear accelerator offering radiotherapy treatment in the city. &quot;The Russians could not have been unaware that this is specifically a medical facility, and one of great value to the residents of Kherson,&quot; Zelensky added. &quot;We will definitely continue to strike Russian military targets &#x2013; with drones and missiles, increasingly with Ukrainian-made ones, specifically targeting military bases and Russian military infrastructure used in this terror against our people. Our defense is entirely just.&quot; Throughout its full-scale invasion, Russia has continuously targeted medical facilities particularly in Ukraine&apos;s eastern oblasts. Ukraine&apos;s Health Ministry reported on July 22 that a total of 1,642 medical facilities have been damaged, and another 214 facilities have been completely destroyed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 &#x2014; although the updated number is likely significantly higher. In July, Russia targeted the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv - Ukraine&apos;s largest children&apos;s medical center - killing 2 and injuring at least 32 more, including children. More recently, a Russian glide bomb attack on Zaporizhzhia on Nov. 8, damaged another cancer hospital. Situated along Ukraine&apos;s front line, Kherson Oblast is the frequent target Russian of attacks. Zelensky has repeatedly called for additional air defense systems from Western allies to better protect critical infrastructure across the country. During a visit to Brussels on Dec. 18, Zelensky called for an additional 19 air defense systems to be provided, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist who attended the briefing.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-cancer-treatment-center-in-kherson-heinous-act-of-cruelty-against-civilians-zelensky-says/	2024-12-21T14:49:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Ukrainian woman in serious condition following Germany's Christmas market attack	A Ukrainian woman is in serious condition after a car plowed into a crowd at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, on the evening of Dec. 20. The incident has claimed five lives and left over 200 people injured, many of them critically. Ukraine&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry confirmed the woman&apos;s nationality on Dec. 21. &quot;Among the victims of the attack on the Christmas market in Magdeburg is a Ukrainian citizen born in 1972. She is in a serious condition in a German hospital.&quot; Ukrainian consular officials are coordinating with the hospital to provide necessary assistance to the injured woman, according to the ministry. Authorities in Magdeburg, the capital of Saxony-Anhalt, reported that the driver believed to be acting alone, was detained shortly after the attack. Investigators are treating the case as premeditated murder and attempted murder. German media identified the suspect as a Saudi Arabian who reportedly sympathized with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Magdeburg&apos;s City official Ronni Krug expressed the community&#x2019;s sorrow and shock over the car-ramming attack that left at least five people dead and over 200 injured. &quot;We have been deeply shaken by yesterday&#x2019;s car-ramming attack,&quot; and added that no one in the city&#x2019;s administration &quot;slept well&quot; following the tragedy. Krug also announced the closure of Magdeburg&#x2019;s Christmas market in light of the Dec. 20 fatal incident for reasons that are &quot;self-explanatory,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-woman-in-serious-condition-following-germanys-christmas-market-attack/	2024-12-21T14:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190304903.jpg
Zelensky meets with CIA director in Kyiv	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 21 that he met with CIA Director William Burns in Ukraine, marking a rare public acknowledgment of their discussions during Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. The United States has been Ukraine&apos;s key ally, providing substantial financial and military aid since the all-out war began nearly three years ago. Washington is also reported to have consistently shared military intelligence to bolster Ukraine&apos;s defense. &quot;Bill Burns visited Ukraine on his final trip as CIA Director. Throughout this war, we&#x2019;ve had many meetings, and I am deeply grateful for his assistance,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X (formerly Twitter), sharing a photo of himself and Burns shaking hands in front of Ukraine&apos;s state crest. Zelensky noted that he and Burns had met multiple times throughout the war, but such encounters were typically kept confidential. &quot;We don&#x2019;t disclose secrets, but we keep in touch. We will likely meet again, and we will surely see how this war ends with a real and lasting peace&#x2014;a peace we are working toward together,&quot; Zelensky said. Burns is set to step down from his role as CIA chief as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to appoint a successor. The last publicly confirmed meeting between Zelensky and Burns took place in mid-2023 when U.S. officials disclosed in July that Burns had recently made a secret visit to Ukraine. While Zelensky did not specify the exact date of their final meeting, he emphasized its significance as Burns prepares to leave his post just one month before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. Trump has pledged to end the war swiftly, raising concerns that Kyiv may face pressure to accept peace terms that favor Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-with-cia-director-in-kyiv/	2024-12-21T13:17:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GfVf7lbX0AEgHx3.jpeg
Russian embassy condemns UK plan to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine aid	The Russian embassy in London criticized the U.K.&apos;s plan to transfer more than two billion pounds ($2.5 billion) to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, calling it a &quot;fraudulent scheme.&quot; In October, the U.K. announced it would provide Ukraine with a 2.26 billion-pound loan as part of a broader package from the Group of Seven (G7) nations. The funds, backed by frozen Russian central bank assets, are intended to support Ukraine&#x2019;s military, purchase weapons, and rebuild damaged infrastructure. The loans were agreed upon in July by G7 leaders&#x2014;comprising the U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States&#x2014;along with senior European Union officials. The majority of the frozen Russian assets are held in EU countries. &quot;We are closely following UK authorities&#x2019; efforts aimed at implementing a fraudulent scheme of expropriating incomes from Russian state assets &apos;frozen&apos; in the EU,&quot; the Russian embassy said on social media. U.K.&apos;s Defense Minister John Healey confirmed the funds would be dedicated solely to Ukraine&#x2019;s military. He noted that the money could help Ukraine develop drones with ranges surpassing some long-range missiles. Russia&#x2019;s embassy described the plan as illegitimate. Last week, Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry accused the United States of &quot;robbery&quot; over its transfer of frozen Russian assets as part of the G7&#x2019;s $50 billion loan package for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-embassy-condemns-uk-plan-to-use-frozen-russian-assets-for-ukraine-aid/	2024-12-21T10:25:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166062306.jpg
Ukraine's General Staff denies Guardian report about air defense personnel being transferred to infantry units	Claims that air defense personnel are being reassigned to infantry roles due to troop shortages are &quot;not credible, and incorrect,&quot; the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said in a Facebook post on Dec. 21. The response follows the publication of a report by the Guardian on Dec. 21, that claimed highly trained air defense specialists were being reassigned to infantry roles, weakening Ukraine&apos;s air defense capabilities. The Facebook post said that while some soldiers from rear units have been reassigned to combat positions, this does not include air defense specialists &quot;tasked with protecting Ukraine&#x2019;s skies.&quot; &#x201C;Reassignments involve military personnel from the Security Forces of Ukraine, some rear mobile fire groups, as well as personnel not involved in the maintenance and operation of high-tech armaments, and military equipment,&#x201D; the statement said. The General Staff also said air defense operations remain effective. &#x201C;The number of shot-down drones has not decreased,&#x201D; the statement said. The Guardian&apos;s report attributed this alleged shift to several factors, including a growing shortage of troops, Ukraine&apos;s refusal to lower the age of conscription despite U.S. insistence, and the deployment of older, less well-trained individuals to the front lines. A source told the Guardian the situation was reaching a critical level, expressing doubts about the air defense&apos;s ability to function effectively. The source also said that many of the redeployed personnel had specialized knowledge of air defense systems, but they were sent to the front lines without adequate preparation for combat roles. Mariana Bezuhla, a Ukrainian MP quoted in The Guardian&apos;s report, commented on the consequences of these alleged decisions on her Telegram channel on Dec. 21. &#x201C;These measures lead to a significant reduction in air defense units, leaving them staffed with inexperienced and older servicemen,&#x201D; she wrote, warning that this could &quot;strain relations with the United States, as Ukraine struggles to mobilize enough personnel to replenish its losses.&quot; She also said that &quot;transferring highly qualified air defense specialists&#x2014;some trained in the West&#x2014;to the front-lines without proper preparation increases the risk of classified information being compromised if they are captured.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a long time since our air defense operated at full capacity, and its quality has significantly deteriorated,&#x201D; she added, The news comes amid escalating aerial threats against Ukraine, marked by a Russian attack on Dec. 20. Five ballistic missiles targeted Kyiv, while other oblasts across the country faced widespread attacks. Just a day earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to &#x201C;test&#x201D; Western air defenses by launching an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile at the Ukrainian capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-redirects-air-defense-personnel-to-frontline-amid-troop-shortages-the-guardian-reports/	2024-12-21T07:34:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2133276712-1.jpg
Slovak PM Robert Fico to visit Putin in Russia next week, Serbian president says	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will travel to Moscow next week to hold talks on gas supplies with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Dec. 20. &quot;Robert Fico will meet with Putin on Monday as the leader of a European Union country, which, I don&apos;t have to tell you what kind of reaction will cause among other European leaders from the EU,&quot; Vucic said in an interview with Serbian media. Vucic said he had &quot;learned unofficially&quot; of the upcoming visit. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement for Russian gas through its territory, set to expire on Dec. 31. The decision has prompted concerns from Slovakia, Hungary and other nations, and Fico on Dec. 20 warned of a looming gas crisis. President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed the refusal during a press conference on Dec. 19, saying that Kyiv would not enable Moscow to earn additional revenue while continuing its war. At a European Union summit, Fico criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s position, saying: &quot;We are demonstrably facing a gas crisis thanks to President Zelensky.&quot; He also suggested that Bratislava might consider &quot;reciprocal measures&quot; if Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Slovakia is halted. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. The issue highlights ongoing dependence on Russian gas in several EU members, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, despite efforts to diversify energy sources following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Earlier this year, the EU implemented its first sanctions targeting the Russian gas industry, focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG). Russian President Vladimir Putin also addressed the matter during his annual press conference on Dec. 19, confirming the end of the contract and expressing confidence in Gazprom&apos;s resilience. &#x201C;This contract will no longer exist. Everything is clear. We will survive, Gazprom will survive,&#x201D; Putin said. Slovakia, which has a long-term contract with Russian oil giant Gazprom has been trying to keep receiving gas through Ukraine, saying buying elsewhere would cost 220 million euros ($228.73 million) more in transit expenses.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-pm-robert-fico-to-visit-putin-in-russia-next-week-serbian-president-says/	2024-12-21T07:14:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190743977.jpg
Orban says Hungary proposing ‘trick’ to keep Russian gas shipments via Ukraine	Hungary is in talks with Moscow and Kyiv hoping to keep open gas shipments via Ukraine, the country&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Dec. 21. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement for Russian gas through its territory, set to expire on Dec. 31. The decision has prompted concerns from Hungary and other nations, and Orban has now hinted at a potentially unconventional solution to keeping the route open for Budapest. &quot;We are now trying the trick ... that what if the gas, by the time it enters the territory of Ukraine, would no longer be Russian but would be already in the ownership of the buyers,&quot; he said in comments reported by Reuters. &quot;So the gas that enters Ukraine would no longer be Russian gas but it would be Hungarian gas.&quot; It&#x2019;s not known how the proposal has gone down in Moscow and Kyiv, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine would not allow Russia to &#x201C;earn additional billions&#x201D; from gas exports while continuing its full-scale invasion. Hungary is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided. Along with Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas, paid for through the now-sanctioned Gazprombank. Hungary receives roughly 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas on an annual basis under a 15-year deal signed in 2021. Earlier this month Hungary requested the U.S. to provide the country with a sanctions waiver to further continue payments for Russian natural gas imports through Gazprombank, Szijjarto said. The United States introduced new sanctions on Nov. 21, targeting dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials. &quot;Yesterday, we filed our request with the relevant American authorities that calls for Gazprombank being granted an exception from sanctions when it comes to payments for natural gas,&quot; Szijjarto said, amid a visit to Washington ahead of President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration. After the sanction were initially announced, Szijjarto said on Nov. 22 that sanctions marked an &quot;attack on our sovereignty,&quot; deeming the implementation as a &quot;threat to energy security.&quot; The U.S. had previously refrained from targeting Gazprombank to allow European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank is the primary channel for energy-related payments. Despite the past restraint, the U.S. Treasury Department said that the most recent sanctions &quot;will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.&quot; The Financial Times noted in its reporting that Russia used Gazprombank to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. The new U.S. sanctions are intended to close one of Russia&apos;s few remaining avenues for international banking, barring Gazprombank from conducting transactions in dollars.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-says-hungary-proposing-trick-to-keep-russian-gas-shipments-via-ukraine/	2024-12-21T04:34:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190226673.jpg
If Putin attacks, we need to be able to wage war,' German Defense Minister says	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has called for an increase in the country&apos;s defense budget, citing Russia as a key reason, German outlet Spiegel reported on Dec. 21. &quot;From 2028, we need a defense budget of at least 80 billion, more likely 90 billion euros a year to meet the demands we have due to the worsening security situation,&quot; Pistorius said, &quot;If Putin attacks, we need to be able to wage war.&quot; Pistorius is the Social Democratic Party&apos;s defense minister in Chancellor Olaf Sholtz&apos;s government, and had already expressed similar thoughts in November, quoted by Ukrainian media UNN. &quot;Our security is a fragile asset. Germany must accelerate and invest more in its military capabilities,&quot; the German defense minister warned on Nov. 23. Now he has come out in favor of a reform of the debt brake in order to increase funding for military defense. &quot;I think it is politically wrong to cling rigidly to the debt brake in this situation,&quot; Pistorius said. &quot;If we finance the necessary expenditure for our defense from the normal budget, it will stifle the state&apos;s ability to act.&quot; Pistorius also believes that the Bundeswehr (the German Army) could be deployed if peacekeepers are required to enforce a ceasefire in Ukraine. &quot;As the largest NATO country in Europe, and the largest economy in Europe, Germany cannot stand by and do nothing,&quot; Pistorius said. But he made it clear that &quot;as long as the war is not over, there will be no German soldiers on Ukrainian soil.&quot; Pistorius had already advocated to push for a larger defense spending in July, as he considered the planned increase insufficient. This follows Trump&apos;s foreign policy team informing European officials of his plan to push NATO allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, compared to the current 2% requirement.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-putin-attacks-we-need-to-be-able-to-wage-war-german-defense-minister-says/	2024-12-21T02:08:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/Umerov-and-Pistorius.jpeg
Two Russian airports suspend flights after Ukrainian drones target Kazan, media, officials report	An airport in the Russian city of Kazan has suspended flights after Ukrainian drones hit several buildings, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Dec. 21. According to the outlet, eight drones attacked the city in the morning hours, with five of them hitting residential buildings across three districts of the city. Russian independent news outlet Meduza reported that four of the eight drones crashed into two high-rise residential buildings and one into a low-rise residential building. Russian state media Kommersant reported that the airports of both Kazan and the neighboring city of Izhevsk had suspended flights. The Kazan mayor&apos;s office has said that schools have been &quot;selectively&quot; evacuated, according to Meduza. No casualties have been reported at this time. Russian state media outlet Tass reported that a drone attempting to attack an industrial plant &quot;missed its target,&quot; according to the press service of the governor of Tatarstan, the republic in which Kazan is located. Kyiv has intensified its drone strike campaign on Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to weaken Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. On Nov. 25, drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) struck an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga.These attacks follow Ukraine&apos;s first use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia and subsequent launches of UK-made Shadow missiles, made possible after Washington eased long-range attack restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-residential-industrial-building-in-russias-tatarstan-oblast-media-report/	2024-12-21T01:30:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-21-at-09_26_57.png
For first time, Ukraine attacks Russian positions using solely ground, FPV drones	Ukrainian forces successfully attacked Russian positions using only ground and first person view (FPV) drones instead of infantry, an army spokesperson claimed on Dec. 20. Speaking on national TV, Sergeant Volodymyr Dehtiarov, spokesperson for the Khartiia Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, said &#x201C;dozens of units of robotic and unmanned equipment&#x201D; supported by surveillance drones were used in the assault near the village of Lyptsi, north of Kharkiv. Dehtiarov said the drones included ground systems equipped with machine guns, and kamikaze FPV drones. He did not specify when the attack took place. Commenting on the reports, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the attack highlighted the difference in attitude towards front line troops shown by Moscow and Kyiv. &quot;Ukrainian officials have repeatedly highlighted Ukraine&apos;s efforts to utilise technological innovations and asymmetric strike capabilities to offset Ukraine&apos;s manpower limitations in contrast with Russia&apos;s willingness to accept unsustainable casualty rates for marginal territorial gains,&quot; the ISW said. Russian military losses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine have exceeded 750,000 Russian soldiers, and are expected to surpass 1 million Russian troops within six months, U.K. Under-Secretary of Defense Luke Pollard said on Dec. 19. The U.K.&apos;s latest estimate is in line with figures from Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, which, as of Dec. 19, sits at 768,220 troops lost since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. &quot;It is highly likely that they have sustained significant combat casualties, whilst only achieving limited tactical gains,&quot; Pollard told British parliamentarians on Dec. 19. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian losses exceeded 45,000 troops and $3 billion worth of equipment in November. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine is developing numerous new types of drone systems. Military tech developers created a new unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with the ability to carry explosives and drive under armored vehicles, the project&apos;s spokesperson, Viktoriia Kovalchuk, told Business Insider on Oct. 25. The UGV, named Ratel S or Honey Badger, was developed as part of the Brave1 government initiative. The initiative was launched in April to invest in defense tech innovations that can be utilized by the Ukrainian military, as well as serve as a platform to connect the industry&apos;s stakeholders. &quot;The main idea is that the robot (Ratel S) is used as a mobile warhead that carries anti-tank mines or other explosive devices,&quot; said Kovalchuk, adding that it can run for 40&#x2013;50 minutes at an average speed or for up to two hours at a slower speed.	https://kyivindependent.com/for-first-time-ukraine-attacks-russian-positions-using-solely-ground-fpv-drones/	2024-12-21T00:22:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2180352947.jpg

Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia injures 4, including child	Russia attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia the evening of Dec. 20, injuring four people, including a 12-year-old boy, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. The attack damaged a 9-story apartment building in the city, Fedorov said. Three women and a 12-year-old boy sustained injuries in the attack. Fedorov did not disclose details about their condition. The same night, a Russian drone attack targeted a residential building in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, also injuring a 12-year-old child. Zaporizhzhia is a frequent target of Russian attacks. A missile strike against the city on Dec. 10 killed 10 people and injured 22. The attack also destroyed a private medical clinic and damaged several buildings. Less than a week before that, an aerial bomb attack against the city on Dec. 6 killed 10 people and injured 24, including two children. The Ukrainian military has been building heavy fortifications near Zaporizhzhia in preparations for a potential Russian offensive in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-injures-4-including-child/	2024-12-20T21:33:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/zapo2.jpg
OSCE urges Tbilisi to institute reforms in final report on Georgian parliamentary elections	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) called on the Georgian government to take action to improve its electoral processes in its final report on Georgia&apos;s October parliamentary elections, published Dec. 20. The pro-Russian Georgian Dream party claimed a sweeping victory in the Oct. 26 elections amid widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation. The disputed results triggered mass demonstrations in Tbilisi. Georgia&apos;s laws provide &quot;an adequate basis for democratic elections,&quot; but recent legislation &quot;marked a step backwards&quot; and election day was characterized &quot;by a tense atmosphere and widespread intimidation of voters,&quot; the OSCE report said. The OSCE also cited unequal financial resources, a polarized media landscape, and the underrepresentation of women as issues undermining the election. &quot;Numerous issues noted in our final report negatively impacted the integrity of these elections and eroded public trust in the process,&quot; said Eoghan Murphy, who led the OSCE election observation mission to Georgia. &quot;To safeguard the democratic principles currently at stake in Georgia, it is imperative that the authorities urgently address all concerns.&quot; The report recommends a number of steps the Georgian government can take to reform its electoral system. These include preventing voter intimidation, undertaking a comprehensive legislative review, changing the process for appointing election commissioners, improving campaign finance oversight, and guaranteeing vote secrecy. The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) does not recognize or endorse any elections, but instead provides assessments of electoral processes in order to let voters form their own conclusions. Opposition parties in Georgia refused to recognize the result of the Oct. 26 parliamentary vote and said the election was stolen. A Tbilisi court in mid-November dismissed 11 lawsuits filed by opposition parties and civil society groups challenging the result, and Georgia&apos;s Central Election Commission confirmed Georgian Dream&apos;s parliamentary victory on Nov. 16. The ruling party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led Georgia closer to the Kremlin while hindering its accession to the European Union. The controversial foreign agents law adopted earlier this year led the EU to effectively freeze Georgia&apos;s accession process. The parliamentary elections and ensuing political crisis sparked a wave of large-scale demonstrations in Tbilisi. A second round of protests kicked off when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia&apos;s integration into the EU could be postponed until 2028.	https://kyivindependent.com/osce-urges-tbilisi-to-institute-reforms-in-final-report-on-georgian-parliamentary-elections/	2024-12-20T21:05:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188785036.jpg
Over 12,000 civilians killed in Ukraine since Russia's full-scale war, UN says	Over 12,340 civilian deaths have been recorded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) Izumi Nakamitsu said during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Dec. 20. The U.N. report on casualties comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates threats against Ukrainian cities, including threatening on Dec. 19 to launch an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded civilian casualties in Ukraine from Feb. 24, 2022 to Nov. 30, 2024, Nakamitsu said. Over 12,340 civilians were killed and more than 27,836 were wounded during that period. The U.N. found that in 2024, aerial bombs and long-range weapons caused a greater number of casualties than in the previous year, Nakamitsu said. Aerial bombs killed 341 civilians and wounded 1,803 between Jan. 1 and Nov. 30, according to data from the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. The figures represent a threefold increase in deaths and sixfold increase in injuries from 2023. The OHCHR also found that 42% of Ukrainian civilian casualties in the month of November resulted from Russian attacks with long-range weapons, a &quot;significant increase&quot; from prior months. Russia intensified aerial strikes against densely populated Ukrainian cities in October and November 2024. Drone strikes surged to record levels and Russia dropped at least 100 guided bombs per day nearly every day between Nov. 1-20. Repeated attacks against residential neighborhoods in large cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, and Sumy, led to high numbers of killed and injured victims. Russia on Nov. 21 launched an Oreshnik missile against the city of Dnipro, supposedly as a response to the U.S. and the U.K. lifting restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia. Putin has since used threats of Oreshnik strikes to intimidate Ukraine and scare off Western support for Kyiv. Nakamitsu said that Russia&apos;s escalating attacks are cause for &quot;grave concerns.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/over-12-000-civilians-killed-in-ukraine-since-russias-full-scale-war-un-says/	2024-12-20T19:22:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/UN.png
IMF approves $1.1 billion in funding for Ukraine	The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the disbursement of $1.1 billion in funds for Ukraine via the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF announced on Dec. 20. The funds represent the latest tranche of the EFF program, which will provide Kyiv with $15.6 billion in budget support over four years. The IMF approved the $1.1 billion tranche after completing its sixth review of the EFF agreement. &quot;Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine continues to take a devastating social and economic toll on Ukraine,&quot; IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a press statement. &quot;Despite the war, macroeconomic stability is being preserved through skillful policymaking by the Ukrainian authorities as well as substantial external support. ... The financial sector remains stable, but vigilance is needed given heightened risks.&quot; The IMF said Ukraine showed &quot;better than expected resilience&quot; to attacks on the energy sector, leading to greater economic growth in 2024 than previously forecasted. The agency predicts an economic slowdown in 2025 due to infrastructure attacks, pressures on the labor market, rising inflation, and the uncertainties of war. Funds from the EFF are intended to help stabilize Ukraine, support the country&apos;s postwar recovery, and promote economic growth as Kyiv moves forward on its path to EU membership. Including the latest round of funding, the IMF has already disbursed $9.8 billion in budget support for Ukraine via the EFF. External financing is critical for Ukraine as it faces mounting economic pressure from Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Kyiv received $42.5 billion in foreign aid last year, and the Finance Ministry has said that the amount needs to increase by at least $12 billion for 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/imf-approves-1-1-billion-in-funding-for-ukraine/	2024-12-20T18:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171755093.jpg
Russian drone attack in Kharkiv injures 6, including child	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian drone struck an apartment building in Kharkiv on Dec. 20, injuring at least six people, including a child, according to Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service. The drone hit a 9-story residential building in the city&apos;s Saltivskyi district late in the evening, authorities said. The attack damaged several apartments and caused a fire. Six people were injured in the attack, including a 12-year-old child. Emergency responders rescued three people from the rubble. Rescue operations are still ongoing at the site. A second drone attack the evening of Dec. 20 caused minor damage to several homes in the city&apos;s Kyivskyi district, regional police reported. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless aerial attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Moscow often targets densely populated neighborhoods with missiles and glide bombs. A Russian missile attack on Nov. 25 targeted central Kharkiv, injuring over 20 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-in-kharkiv-injures-6-including-child/	2024-12-20T17:28:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/kharkiv1.jpg
Trump plans to continue US military aid to Ukraine after inauguration, FT reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump plans to continue military support for Ukraine, the Financial Times reported on Dec. 20, citing undisclosed sources. Three officials familiar with discussions revealed that Trump intends to keep supplying US military equipment to Ukraine after his inauguration. Trump&apos;s foreign policy team also informed European officials that he plans to push NATO allies to raise their defense spending to 5% of their GDP. NATO member states currently follow a goal of allocating 2% of their GDP to defense spending. British officials noted that Trump sees providing weapons after a ceasefire as aligning with his &quot;peace through strength&quot; philosophy. However, he remains opposed to Ukraine joining NATO and advocates for an immediate resolution to the conflict. This contrasts with his earlier campaign rhetoric, where he suggested cutting off aid to Ukraine and pushing for peace talks. Trump has pledged to quickly bring an end to the war but has not provided details on how he plans to do it. He has not invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to his January inauguration but noted that Zelensky would be &#x201C;welcome&#x201D; if he chose to attend.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-to-continue-us-military-aid-to-ukraine-after-inauguration-ft-reports/	2024-12-20T16:24:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2177668198.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russian An-72 military transport plane damaged in blast near Moscow, Ukraine's intel claims	Key developments on Dec. 20: A power unit of a Russian An-72 military transport plane blew up at the Ostafyevo airfield in Moscow Oblast last week, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 20. The Russian Navy plane&apos;s main power unit exploded on Dec. 12, the military intelligence agency said without providing details on the cause or circumstances of the explosion. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The An-72 is a Soviet transport aircraft, developed by Antonov, Ukraine&apos;s largest aircraft manufacturing company. The plane is used mainly by the military and has an estimated price tag of around $4.5 million. HUR shared footage of the explosion without explicitly claiming responsibility for the incident. The Ostafyevo airfield is located over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage purporting to show an explosion at the Ostafyevo airfield in Moscow Oblast on Dec. 12, 2024. (Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence)&quot;There will be just retribution for every war crime committed against the people of Ukraine,&quot; the agency said. Previously, Ukraine claimed responsibility for several aircraft sabotage operations inside Russia. In July, a HUR-coordinated operation resulted in damage to three Mi-28 and Ka-226 helicopters on the territory of the Moscow-based National Center of Helicopter Construction of Mil and Kamov, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent at the time. Another operation the same month reportedly led to the destruction of a Mi-8 helicopter at the Samara Kryazh military airfield in Samara Oblast, roughly 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Russia launched a series of missile attacks against Kyiv on the morning of Dec. 20, reportedly killing one person, injuring 12, and causing damage across the city. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv around 7 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that air defenses were operating over the city. Russia attacked the capital with five ballistic missiles of the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model, the Air Force said. All five missiles were reportedly shot down, with debris falling in several districts of the city. One person was killed and at least 10 injured in the Holosiivskyi district, and at least one was injured in the Shevchenkivskyi district, the State Emergency Service reported. Five people remain hospitalized as of 1 p.m. local time. In the Holosiivskyi district, the missile wreckage damaged office buildings, residential buildings, a gas pipe, and five cars. A fire broke out on the roof of one of the office buildings, and the 15th floor was damaged, possibly trapping people inside, authorities said. Sixteen medical institutions, 17 schools, 13 kindergartens, and 630 residential buildings in the district were left without heating as a result of damaged infrastructure.

(Kyiv City Military Administration/Telegram)Fires were also reported at non-residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts of Kyiv. Initial reports about damage in the Dnipro district have not been confirmed. A blast wave damaged the stained glass windows of the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Cathedral in the Pechersk district, the Ukraine International Institute of Restoration said. Footage shared by journalist Yan Dobronosov shows damage at an office building across the street. A large-scale fire also broke out in a warehouse in the Boryspil district of Kyiv Oblast, covering 15,000 square meters, the State Emergency Service reported. The fire had been contained as of 4:05 a.m. local time.

(Kyiv City Military Administration/Telegram)In recent months, Russia has continued to intensify its drone and missile attacks targeting different regions of Ukraine. On Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to &quot;experiment&quot; on Western air defenses by launching an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) at Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly called on Western allies to provide more air defenses to the embattled country. On Dec. 18, during a visit to Brussels, Zelensky called for allies to provide an additional 19 air defense systems to protect against Russian strikes on critical infrastructure. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Dec. 20 that it had gathered evidence against Colonel General Alexei Kim, the Russian officer allegedly responsible for the Aug. 24 missile attack on the Sapfir Hotel in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast. The strike killed Ryan Evans, a British security adviser for Reuters, and injured six others, including two Reuters journalists. Kim, a deputy chief of Russia&apos;s General Staff, signed the directive and issued the combat order for the Iskander-M ballistic missile strike, according to the SBU. The SBU said that Kim directed one of his missile units to target the hotel despite it being occupied solely by civilians. SBU investigators charged Kim in absentia under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code with waging a war of aggression and violating the laws and customs of war. The charges align with Ukraine&apos;s broader efforts to hold Russian military leaders accountable for targeting civilian infrastructure and committing war crimes. This development follows the Dec. 17 assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, head of Russia&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological defense forces, in an alleged SBU operation in Moscow. Ukrainian prosecutors had previously charged Kirillov with deploying banned chemical weapons in the conflict. Ukrainian forces withdrew from the area of the Uspenivka and Trudove settlements in Donetsk Oblast after &quot;heavy defensive battles,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said on Dec. 20. The statement came in reaction to the DeepState monitoring group claiming that some troops did not manage to pull back after Russia captured the two settlements, completing the capture of the so-called Uspenivka pocket. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry announced the capture of Uspenivka on Dec. 20. Analysts have been long warning that the Russian advance threatens to encircle Ukrainian troops in the area. The sector lies roughly 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of the embattled front-line town of Kurakhove. &quot;Commander-in-Chief (Oleksandr Syrskyi) decided to withdraw Defense Forces units from the said area to avoid encirclement,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said, refuting claims about stranded soldiers. &quot;The units, which have been fighting heavy defensive battles against a superior force for a long time, carried out necessary maneuvers to avoid encirclement and continue performing tasks on the Kurakhove-Konstantynopolske axis.&quot; According to DeepState, Russia is regrouping in the newly captured area and attacking in the direction of the Shevchenko-Andriivka section, threatening to create a new pocket. Russian forces are now focusing their efforts on the nearby town of Andriivka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Throughout the autumn, Russian forces have made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, while advancing on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. Syrskyi said on Dec. 19 that Russian forces are carrying out simultaneous attacks along the front line, claiming that &quot;Ukrainian defense forces did not allow Russian forces to breach the defense and achieve operational success in any direction.&quot; Ukraine is increasingly on the back foot of the war as its resources grow thin, and the prospects of vitally important Western aid remain uncertain following the U.S. election victory of Donald Trump.

The World Bank&apos;s Board of Directors on Dec. 18 approved $2.05 billion in Development Policy Operation (DPO) grants, which is part of the U.S.&apos;s $20 billion contribution to the G7 loan. The DPO funds are co-financed by two sources: $1 billion from the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund (F.O.R.T.I.S. Ukraine FIF) and $1.05 billion from the Advancing Needed Credit Enhancement (ADVANCE) Ukraine Trust Fund, supported by the U.K. and Japan. &quot;We are grateful to our partners for their support on the path of economic development and reconstruction,&quot; Shmyhal said on Telegram. The DPO funds will focus on Ukraine&apos;s growth potential, supporting the railway sector, banking, and renewable energy generation, the World Bank said. Funding will also support efforts to increase domestic revenues. The EU said it would begin paying its portion of the G7 loan &#x2014; 18.1 billion euros ($18.8 billion) &#x2014; in January. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico warned of a looming gas crisis on Dec. 20 as Ukraine maintained its refusal to extend the transit agreement for Russian gas, set to expire on Dec. 31, Reuters reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed the refusal during a press conference on Dec. 19, saying that Kyiv would not enable Moscow to earn additional revenue while continuing its war. At a European Union summit, Fico criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s position, saying, &quot;We are demonstrably facing a gas crisis thanks to President Zelensky.&quot; He also suggested that Bratislava might consider &quot;reciprocal measures&quot; if Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Slovakia is halted. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. The issue highlights ongoing dependence on Russian gas in several EU members, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, despite efforts to diversify energy sources following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Earlier this year, the EU implemented its first sanctions targeting the Russian gas industry, focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG). Russian President Vladimir Putin also addressed the matter during his annual press conference on Dec. 19, confirming the end of the contract and expressing confidence in Gazprom&apos;s resilience. &#x201C;This contract will no longer exist. Everything is clear. We will survive, Gazprom will survive,&#x201D; Putin said. Slovakia, which has a long-term contract with Russian oil giant Gazprom has been trying to keep receiving gas through Ukraine, saying buying elsewhere would cost 220 million euros ($228.73 million) more in transit expenses. Russia&apos;s Central Bank decided on Dec. 20 to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 21%, contrary to expert expectations of an increase, Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency reported. To rein in accelerating inflation fueled by war spending, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has been raising its interest rate from 7.5% in July 2023 to the current 21% - the highest level since the early 2000s. The tight monetary policy of Elvira Nabiullina, the Central Bank&apos;s chief, has drawn criticism from businesses in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex. On Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin also mentioned the problem, saying that some experts believe that the central bank should have started using tools other than rate hikes to fight inflation. Most analysts, including those polled by Russian media outlet RBC, anticipated a hike of 200 basis points to 23%. Ahead of the decision, major Russian banks raised savings deposit yields to 24-25% per annum, reflecting expectations of tighter monetary policy. The Central Bank said that, based on inflation and credit trends, the feasibility of raising the rate further would be assessed at its next meeting. Nabiullina has been involved in a conflict over rate hikes with Sergei Chemezov, the influential CEO of the state-owned defense giant Rostec. &quot;If we continue working this way, most enterprises will essentially go bankrupt,&quot; Chemezov said in October, commenting on increases in the Central Bank&apos;s rate. Former economic advisor and opposition politician Vladimir Milov told the Kyiv Independent in November that both sides have valid concerns. &quot;Chemezov is right that businesses will have to shut down at such a (high interest) rate,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;Nabiullina is right that the rate cannot be cut because in that case there will be hyperinflation like in Turkey.&quot; He continued that &quot;there is only one way out &#x2014; finish the war and withdraw Russian troops&quot; from Ukraine. The balance between controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability remains a critical challenge for Russia&#x2019;s Central Bank, as the war economy continues to strain the nation&apos;s financial system.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-an-72-military-transport-plane-damaged-in-blast-near-moscow-ukraines-intel-claims/	2024-12-20T14:03:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Russian_Air_Force_-_Antonov_An-72.jpg
Druzhba pipeline disruption halts Russian, Kazakh oil shipments to Europe, Reuters reports	Russian and Kazakh oil shipments to Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, and Germany via the Druzhba pipeline have been halted since Dec. 19 due to technical issues at a Russian pumping station, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world&#x2019;s largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd), is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. Transneft, the Russian state-owned pipeline operator, identified a problem at the Unecha pumping station in Russia&#x2019;s Bryansk Oblast, near the Belarusian border. Belarus&apos; Belneftekhim confirmed the disruption to oil supplies via Druzhba to the Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta, stating that Belarusian refineries are relying on stored reserves to continue operations. The halt affects its southern branch, which had been transporting 300,000 bpd to EU countries granted exemptions from the EU&apos;s ban on Russian pipeline oil. These countries include Hungary, Slovakia, and Czechia, which rely on Russian supplies. Sources told Reuters that oil deliveries from Russia&apos;s western ports &#x2014; Novorossiisk, Ust-Luga, and Primorsk &#x2014; remain unaffected, and Druzhba&apos;s oil could be rerouted to these ports. While one source suggested the issue might be resolved within days, another indicated that the suspension could last until the end of December. The EU has largely phased out Russian oil imports following Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, the Druzhba pipeline&#x2019;s southern branch remains active under exemptions for certain Central European countries. The northern branch primarily transports Kazakh crude oil to Germany via Poland&apos;s Gdansk port, as Poland ceased importing Russian pipeline oil in early 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/druzhba-pipeline-disruption-halts-russian-kazakh-oil-shipments-to-europe-reuters-reports/	2024-12-20T13:37:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1229695804.jpg
Ukraine, US agree on date of peace envoy Kellogg's visit to Kyiv, official says	Ukraine and the U.S. have reached a preliminary agreement on the date of a visit to Kyiv by Keith Kellogg, President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for Ukraine peace envoy, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 20 briefing. Tykhyi did not disclose the specific date of the visit for security reasons. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that Kellogg would visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. According to Tykhyi, Kyiv intends to use the visit to communicate &quot;important information from the Ukrainian side&quot; that should be considered as the incoming U.S. administration develops its strategy for achieving a just peace. He said that preliminary arrangements had been made, and Kyiv is preparing to host the Trump team representative. Kellogg, 80, previously served as executive secretary and chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council under Trump and as a top advisor to then-Vice President Mike Pence. His forthcoming visit underscores the significant role the U.S. will likely play in shaping the future of peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Reuters reported that Kellogg and Frederick H. Fleitz, another senior advisor to Trump, had proposed a peace plan that included freezing the front lines, ceasing military aid to Ukraine unless it agreed to negotiations, and shelving Ukraine&apos;s aspirations for NATO membership. During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to bring an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, claiming he could broker a deal &quot;that&apos;s good for both sides.&quot; However, his comments, including praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and skepticism of further U.S. assistance to Ukraine, have raised concerns in Kyiv about the potential shift in U.S. policy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-prepares-for-trumps-peace-envoy-kellogg-visit-foreign-ministry-confirms/	2024-12-20T13:04:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-643210102.jpg
Ukraine reshuffles diplomatic team, Zelensky announces over 30 new appointments	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the approval of over 30 Ukrainian ambassadorial appointments abroad during his evening address on Dec. 20. The appointments follow a significant reshuffle within Ukraine&apos;s diplomatic and governmental framework earlier this year. &#x201C;I approved more than 30 decisions, including Nariman Dzhelyal to Turkey, Alyona Getmanchuk as Ukraine&apos;s representative to NATO, and Andrii Melnyk as Ukraine&apos;s representative to the UN,&#x201D; Zelensky said. He added that the formal decrees will follow soon, adhering to diplomatic procedures. Key appointments include: Nariman Dzhelyal: Deputy chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People and a former political prisoner recently released from Russian captivity in June 2024. Alyona Getmanchuk: Ukrainian foreign policy analyst, Director of the New Europe Center, and Associate Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council. Andrii Melnyk: Former Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Germany, currently serving as Ukraine&apos;s Ambassador to Brazil. Ukraine&apos;s parliament on Sept. 5 confirmed Andrii Sybiha as the new foreign minister after Dmytro Kuleba&apos;s resignation, marking a shift in Kyiv&apos;s diplomatic team amid the ongoing challenges posed by war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reshuffles-diplomatic-team-zelensky-announces-over-30-new-appointments/	2024-12-20T12:29:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-8_13_53-PM.jpeg
Russia buys acceptance with cash, plunging economy into uncertainty	For Russia&apos;s military recruiters, money talks. In July, Russian President Vladimir Putin doubled the federal signing-on bonus for contract soldiers to 400,000 rubles ($3,850) &#x2014; over five times the country&apos;s average monthly wage. Regional governments are expected to top this up further, although the exact amount differs in each area. In the Siberian Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, soldiers receive 2.2 million rubles from city hall ($21,000). In Belgorod Oblast, it&apos;s an additional 2.6 million ($25,200). These benefits &#x2013; as well as payments to veterans and to soldiers&apos; families in the event of their deaths &#x2014; have been vital in enticing men to join the Russian army. Speaking on Dec. 16, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that more than 430,000 people had signed up to join the country&apos;s Armed Forces in 2024 alone. Most troops hail from Russia&apos;s most disadvantaged regions &#x2014; places where the prospect of upfront cash is simply too difficult to ignore. But these payments are also increasingly warping Russia&apos;s social fabric. The funds used to provide local sign-on bonuses, as well as war pensions, are drawn from regional welfare budgets: money traditionally put aside to support vulnerable groups such as disabled people or large families. An investigation by independent Russian news outlet iStories found that war payments increasingly dominate these funds. Data analysis shows that from a sample of 48 Russian regions, more than a third are allocating 25 percent or more of welfare budgets to war-related payments. In some regions, that percentage rises dramatically. In the Stavropol Krai in Russia&apos;s North Caucasus, some 62 percent of social welfare spending has been allocated to providing war pensions and support for wounded veterans. Data analyzed by the BBC and Mediazona to estimate Russia&apos;s war deaths found that as of mid-December, at least 1,342 soldiers from &#xA0;Stavropol Krai had died in Ukraine, although this is likely to be an undercount. More than 200,000 people have reported to service under partial mobilization in Moscow, Russia on Oct. 4, 2022. (Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)A further 21 percent of Stavropol Krai&apos;s social welfare budget, or 2 billion rubles ($19.4 million), went to providing sign-on incentives, iStories reported. At the start of 2024, the region offered a relatively modest regional bonus of 100,000 rubles ($968). By the end of the year, that had catapulted to 1.6 million ($15,500). The shift put its bonus on par with neighboring Karachay-Cherkessia, which had already pumped 63 percent of the region&apos;s welfare budget into providing sign-on incentives. These sweeping payments leave little behind for Russia&apos;s most vulnerable. Stavropol Krai paid 83 percent of its 2024 welfare budget to soldiers, veterans, and their families but just 2 percent to children in state care and 4 percent to the unemployed. In Karachay-Cherkessia, war payments outstripped unemployment benefits nine times over. The changing face of Russia&apos;s welfare state reveals how the Kremlin is buying the acceptance &#x2014; if not the support &#x2014; of millions of ordinary Russians while the country&apos;s economic future is bargained to fuel its wartime present. Welfare payments have an outsized impact on Russian society precisely because they are so needed. Most Russians do not live in poverty, says Thomas F. Remington, a visiting professor of government at Harvard University. However, a high proportion hover just above it, struggling to get by. &quot;How we measure poverty always varies, but by reasonable measures, the share of people in poverty (in Russia) is not so great,&quot; Remington says. &quot;But the share of people who are near poverty, those who are just hovering close to the poverty line, living on meager, barely adequate wages or special income such as pensions, there&apos;s quite a high proportion.&quot; In these struggling communities, in particular, war-related payments can win acceptance for the full-scale invasion and the government itself. Using the welfare state to placate particular social groups is a well-worn tactic, says Sarah Wilson Sohkey, associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Colorado. Payments may not win a person&apos;s outright support for government policy, but it can make them less likely to protest.

(Roman Romokhov / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;For example, what Putin has done &#x2014; very strategically &#x2014; is that every time there is a presidential election, he boosts pension payments. (Former Russian President Boris) Yeltsin did this, too, repeatedly. Those one-time bumps before every presidential election, very consistently, were really good in ensuring that pensioners would keep supporting them,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s not really buying people&apos;s loyalty, but more their acquiescence.&quot; Making one-off payments in a bid to encourage specific actions, such as joining the army, is also well-inscribed in the Kremlin playbook. In Russia, one-off payments have been made to encourage families to have more children &#x2014; a topic that Moscow has been keen to promote amid a plummeting birth rate. &quot;The welfare state has always been about manufacturing consent,&quot; says Dr. Amanda Zadorian, a visiting assistant professor of politics at Oberlin College. &quot;The kind of direct payments that we see (in Russia) incentivize a very specific behavior, whereas, for benefits like pensions payments, we haven&apos;t really seen increases.&quot; There is some risk that Russia is sowing the seeds of later discontent with generous war benefits. Welfare payments may be propping up Russia&apos;s economy, but they, too, come with a cost: investment in education or healthcare, for example, or support for vulnerable groups. Yet, while Russia&apos;s welfare system has been used to placate the population, its weakening or disintegration is unlikely to cause widespread unrest, says Wilson Sohkey. In many cases, it is the families that rely most on Russia&apos;s state services that are also benefiting from war payments &#x2014; and their focus is survival, rather than political policy. &quot;For Russians from poor rural areas, the money (that comes from joining the army) just means so much to them,&quot; says Wilson Sohkey. &quot;They&apos;re not sitting there with this meta-view of the education system not being very good. They&apos;re getting a big one-time payment that&apos;s sometimes vital for their family&apos;s survival.&quot; The Kremlin has also been able to face down previous protests on welfare issues. When Moscow decided to raise the state pension age in 2018, rallies took place in tens of towns and cities across Russia, already a rare show of defiance. But despite somewhat poor local election results that year, Moscow was still able to pass the reform without difficulty. The one-off nature of sign-on bonuses in particular makes them an easy win for the Kremlin, says Zadorian. Unlike pensions, which require a decades-long commitment, one-time bonuses put little pressure on the government itself, keeping expectations low and removing the threat of potentially unfulfilled promises that could boil into resentment. &quot;If people perceive that something might be being taken away from them, they respond more negatively than if they never had anything in the first place,&quot; says Zadorian. &quot;It&apos;s much easier to create this sense of entitlement.&quot; War-related payments are not only shaping Russia&apos;s social spending. They are also obscuring and accelerating potential economic pain. War benefits, as well as higher salaries for workers producing war-related goods, have acted as a buoyancy aid not only for struggling families, but the Russian economy as a whole. As soldiers&apos; families spend, their new-found wealth is spread throughout their communities, driving Russia&apos;s economy. This growth, however, is unlikely to be healthy or sustainable in years to come. Increased state spending is also driving a growing threat to Russia&apos;s economy: inflation. Prices rose 8.9% in November 2024 compared to the previous year, more than twice the state&apos;s 4% target. In a country where many families spend a large proportion of their income on food, state benefits have cushioned the blow for the most vulnerable. Yet, if inflation continues, it may no longer be enough. &quot;The crunch, if and when it comes, will have to do with high grocery prices. If Putin agrees to relax interest rates and we get into very high inflation and the devaluation of currency, I don&apos;t think that can last long,&quot; says Remington. &quot;That&apos;s when we get rationing; we get hoarding; we get shortages &#x2014; and we get real political protests.&quot; Pouring money, attention, and effort into the military also damages wider productivity, Remington says. While military innovation can be used to create real-world economic benefits for ordinary people, this is not an area where Russia has traditionally excelled. A military cadet stands in front of a billboard promoting contract army service in Saint Petersburg, Ukraine on Oct. 5, 2022. (Olga Maltseva / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;Russia, historically, has not been good at converting the technologies that it develops for the military into benefits for the overall economy. In the Soviet era, military technology was pretty good, but the benefits of it tended not to spill over. In particular, with the invasion of Ukraine, wider industry is now being starved of investment. When you&apos;re producing overwhelmingly for the war, you are not upgrading the level of technological effectiveness,&quot; Remington says. All of this ultimately forecasts trouble for the Russian economy&apos;s longer-term prospects. &quot;The economy is setting itself back a decade by devoting everything to the war. That means that the overall capacity of the economy to maintain a good standard of living for an aging population is diminishing,&quot; Remington says. &quot;They&apos;re consuming their future for the sake of their present.&quot; While some Russians may consider death a risk worth taking for a cash lump sum, it will never &#x2014; economically or otherwise &#x2014; equal a person&apos;s life. &quot;The sign-on bonus money does not replace the economic productivity of a person over the course of their lifetime,&quot; says Zadorian. &quot;In the long term, we&apos;re less likely to see that effect of payments stimulating local economies and more likely to see further dependence on the state.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-buys-acceptance-with-cash-plunging-economy-into-uncertainty/	2024-12-20T12:14:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2084805640.jpg
Several countries interested in deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine, Foreign Ministry says	Discussions regarding the potential deployment of Western peacekeepers in Ukraine are gaining traction, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said during a Dec. 20 briefing. This idea, initially proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, has reportedly garnered interest from multiple countries. &#x201C;Indeed, in addition to France, there are several other countries that have expressed their readiness to take such a step,&#x201D; Tykhyi said. He reiterated President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s support for Macron&#x2019;s proposal, which the Ukrainian leader expressed during a Dec. 19 briefing in Brussels. Tykhyi emphasized that discussions are still general and lack specific details regarding deployment timing. Paris and London are exploring the deployment of French and U.K. troops to monitor a potential ceasefire along the contact line, a senior NATO official told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in early December. The official, speaking anonymously, clarified that these discussions are taking place bilaterally in national capitals rather than within NATO structures. The concept of deploying Western troops to Ukraine resurfaced earlier this year. Macron first raised the possibility in February and revisited it in May, suggesting that France might consider sending troops if Russian forces breached Ukraine&#x2019;s front lines. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has also advocated for European troops to lead in monitoring a potential ceasefire, the Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12. He has repeatedly emphasized that Europe should take greater responsibility in addressing Russian aggression. Zelensky supported Macron&apos;s proposal but only after securing a clear timeline for NATO membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/several-countries-interested-in-deploying-peacekeepers-to-ukraine-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-12-20T12:07:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Fico criticizes Zelensky over refusal to extend Russian gas transit, warns of crisis	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico warned of a looming gas crisis on Dec. 20 as Ukraine maintained its refusal to extend the transit agreement for Russian gas, set to expire on Dec. 31, Reuters reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky reaffirmed the refusal during a press conference on Dec. 19, saying that Kyiv would not enable Moscow to earn additional revenue while continuing its war. At a European Union summit, Fico criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s position, saying, &quot;We are demonstrably facing a gas crisis thanks to President Zelensky.&quot; He also suggested that Bratislava might consider &quot;reciprocal measures&quot; if Russian gas transit through Ukraine to Slovakia is halted. Slovakia has a long-term contract with Russia&apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and estimates alternative arrangements could cost an additional &#x20AC;220 million ($228.73 million) in transit fees. The issue highlights ongoing dependence on Russian gas in several EU members, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, despite efforts to diversify energy sources following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Earlier this year, the EU implemented its first sanctions targeting the Russian gas industry, focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG). Russian President Vladimir Putin also addressed the matter during his annual press conference on Dec. 19, confirming the end of the contract and expressing confidence in Gazprom&apos;s resilience. &#x201C;This contract will no longer exist. Everything is clear. We will survive, Gazprom will survive,&#x201D; Putin said. Slovakia, which has a long-term contract with Russian oil giant Gazprom has been trying to keep receiving gas through Ukraine, saying buying elsewhere would cost 220 million euros ($228.73 million) more in transit expenses.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-criticizes-zelensky-over-refusal-to-extend-russian-gas-transit-warns-of-crisis/	2024-12-20T10:55:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Ukraine charges Russian general with killing Reuters employee in Kramatorsk	The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced on Dec. 20 that it had gathered evidence against Colonel General Alexei Kim, the Russian officer allegedly responsible for the Aug. 24 missile attack on the Sapfir Hotel in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast. The strike killed Ryan Evans, a British security adviser for Reuters, and injured six others, including two Reuters journalists. Kim, a deputy chief of Russia&apos;s General Staff, signed the directive and issued the combat order for the Iskander-M ballistic missile strike, according to the SBU. The SBU said that Kim directed one of his missile units to target the hotel despite it being occupied solely by civilians. SBU investigators charged Kim in absentia under Ukraine&apos;s Criminal Code with waging a war of aggression and violating the laws and customs of war. The charges align with Ukraine&apos;s broader efforts to hold Russian military leaders accountable for targeting civilian infrastructure and committing war crimes. This development follows the Dec. 17 assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, head of Russia&apos;s radiation, chemical, and biological defense forces, in an alleged SBU operation in Moscow. Ukrainian prosecutors had previously charged Kirillov with deploying banned chemical weapons in the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-charges-russian-general-for-killing-reuters-staff-injuring-civilians-in-kramatorsk-hotel-attack/	2024-12-20T09:37:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/66cb5e663c9c0179865149.jpg
Belarus Weekly: EU imposes new sanctions on Belarusian officials, companies supporting regime	The EU imposes new sanctions on Belarusian officials and companies supporting the regime of Alexander Lukashenko. In response to Belarus and Russia&#x2019;s artificial migration crisis, the EU pledged 170 million euros for border security and backed Poland&#x2019;s plan to suspend the right to asylum. Belarus labels exiled National Theater actors as an &#x201C;extremist formation,&#x201D; criminalizing interactions with them for Belarusians inside the country. Minsk arrested seven ex-journalists of the closed newspaper as the pre-election crackdowns continued. EU announces a 30 million euro aid program for Belarusian civil society in 2025. The Council of the European Union on Dec. 16 imposed a fresh set of sanctions against 26 individuals and two companies in Belarus. According to the press release, the restrictions were introduced &#x201C;in view of the situation in the country.&#x201D; The new measures targeted members of the judiciary responsible for politically motivated persecution and the heads of penal facilities where political prisoners are held in &#x201C;inhumane conditions.&#x201D; Belarus has nearly 1,300 political prisoners, who were sentenced in the aftermath of nationwide protests in the wake of the sham 2020 presidential election. At least 2,200 former political prisoners have since been released after serving their full term, while over 50,000 individuals have been subjected to arbitrary detentions throughout the past four years, according to Viasna Human Rights Center. The list of sanctioned individuals also includes the business owners and board members of two companies that benefited from the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko and were involved in sanctions circumvention. The new restrictions impose an asset freeze on the transportation and storage company, Vlate Logistik LLC, which operated two privately owned customs checkpoints at the Belarus-EU border, and Ruzekspeditsiya LLC, which has been facilitating EU sanctions circumvention by exporting sanctioned fertilizers and taking delivery of cars prohibited for sale to Belarus, which are subsequently supplied to Russia. &#xA0; Throughout his 30-year rule, Lukashenko has been repeatedly subjected to European sanctions due to his regime&#x2019;s human rights abuse, disappearances of political opponents, and the instrumentalization of migration. Since 2022, the EU, the United States, and other Western states have introduced sectoral and financial sanctions over Minsk&#x2019;s support for Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Altogether, the restrictions apply to 287 individuals and 39 entities in Belarus. The European Commission has supported Poland&#x2019;s controversial plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum for illegal immigrants if they are believed to have been &#x201C;weaponized&#x201D; by Belarus and Russia. The move allows Poland and other EU states to suspend the &#x201C;fundamental rights&#x201D; of migrants if it is suspected that Russia and Belarus organized their transport from their home countries to the EU&#x2019;s border, and facilitated their crossing. To further enhance border surveillance, the European Union pledged 170 million euros ($179 million) of funding to Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Norway. The funds will go towards upgrading electronic surveillance equipment, deploying mobile detection and counter-drone equipment, and enhancing the mobility of border patrols. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced on Oct. 15 the adoption of the contentious plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum of the waves of irregular migrants from third countries gathering on the country&#x2019;s eastern border and arriving via Belarus and Russia. Brussels accuses Belarus and Russia of the &#x201C;weaponization of migration,&#x201D; describing it as &#x201C;hybrid warfare&#x201D; designed to &#x201C;destabilize&#x201D; European societies, according to the Communication to Support Member States adopted on Dec. 11. Adopting the communication represents a change in the EU&#x2019;s approach to a more conservative stance in its migration policy. Following an initial pushback and demands that Poland implement the provisions of the bloc&#x2019;s migration pact, the EU&#x2019;s executive branch accepted the possibility and outlined the conditions for the suspension of the right to asylum. Despite a subsequent outcry from human rights organizations demanding that the right to asylum in Europe be upheld, the EU Commission decided that the suspension of fundamental rights is possible, although it has to be &#x201C;proportionate, limited to what is strictly necessary in clearly defined cases, and temporary.&#x201D; Minsk began sending migrants to the EU&#x2019;s borders in the summer of 2021, responding to European sanctions introduced over the human rights abuse after the rigged 2020 Belarusian presidential elections and the forced landing of a European commercial flight in Minsk. One of Lukashenko&#x2019;s political opponents on board the plane was arrested, jailed, and has subsequently been used as a regime propaganda mouthpiece. Following an initial abatement of the crisis in 2021, since 2023 the number of illegal arrivals has risen by 66%. Brussels believes Russia is facilitating the renewed hybrid attacks, as 90% of the migrants illegally crossing the Polish-Belarusian border have a Russian student or tourist visa. Poland has stopped 26,000 illicit border crossing attempts in 2024 alone, according to the country&#x2019;s Defense Ministry. Continuous crossing attempts by migrants prompted Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania to build walls along their borders with Belarus. The Belarusian Internal Affairs Ministry has declared former actors of the Belarusian National Theater to be members of an &#x201C;extremist formation,&#x201D; Russian state-run news outlet Sputnik has reported. Over 60 employees of Yanka Kupala National Academic Theater in Minsk resigned from the theater in protest following the rigged 2020 presidential elections, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide. In exile, the former actors launched a theater group called &#x201C;Volnya Kupalaucy,&#x201D; touring Europe and broadcasting their work on YouTube. Belarus&#x2019;s law enforcers accused the exiled theater group of allegedly &#x201C;preparing to commit attacks on Belarus&#x2019;s sovereignty&#x201D; and &#x201C;discrediting state officials.&#x201D; They banned the group from the Belarusian segment of the Internet. Participation in the group or &#x201C;communicating information&#x201D; to its representatives is now punishable with up to seven years of imprisonment, according to Belarusian law. The group&#x2019;s designation as an &#x201C;extremist formation&#x201D; serves as a confirmation that &#x201C;Belarusian culture is a threat to the regime,&#x201D; the former theater&#x2019;s director and current opposition figure Pavel Latushka told independent Belarusian news outlet Pozirk. In 2020, after the Culture Ministry fired Latushka from his position as a theater director for supporting the movement, sixty employees resigned, leaving the theater idle for nearly three months. Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime has frequently wielded its anti-extremism legislation against expressions of dissent. According to Viasna, at least 4,766 Belarusians are currently recognized as &#x201C;extremists,&#x201D; and countless media outlets and communities of Belarusians abroad have been slapped with the &#x201C;extremist formation&#x201D; label, criminalizing interactions with them for Belarusians within the country. &#xA0; Belarusian authorities have arrested seven former journalists of the regional newspaper Intex Press, the Viasna Human Rights Center reported on Dec. 12. The arrest of the journalists comes amid sweeping raids against opponents of the regime ahead of the January 2025 presidential elections. The first presidential vote since the contested 2020 race &#x2014; which sent the country into a lasting political crisis &#x2014; is set to extend Lukashenko&#x2019;s three-decade rule of the country, which began when he was elected president in 1994. The raids in the western city of Baranavichy targeted seven former employees of the Intex Press, the largest regional newspaper in Belarus. They were accused of &#x201C;facilitating extremist activities.&#x201D; Charges of &#x201C;extremism&#x201D; are frequently brought against independent media in Belarus to obstruct their work, the independent Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) notes in a statement on the arrests. It called for a halt to the &#x201C;witch hunt&#x201D; against journalists. The independent association, which defends media freedoms in Belarus, has also been given an &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; status by the Lukashenko regime. The detentions in Baranavichy brought the total count of jailed journalists to 45, the BAJ reports. &#x201C;Journalists, even after the closure of their publications, continue to face threats and harassment, which hampers their work and creates a climate of fear,&#x201D; said the Brest regional branch of Viasna. Intex Press&#x2019;s print run was terminated in 2021 following the publication of an interview with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who claimed to have beaten Lukashenko on the ballot in the 2020 presidential elections. Government-run firms refused to print and disseminate the newspaper. The Information Ministry terminated the newspaper&#x2019;s license the following year. &#xA0; The newspaper&#x2019;s online publications were designated extremist in April 2023 and its website was blocked. The international media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranked Belarus fourth among the world&#x2019;s biggest journalist jailers in 2024, along with China, Myanmar, and Israel. The country ranks 167 out of 180 in the annual Press Freedom Index, having dropped ten places since 2023. The European Commission has announced 30 million euros ($31.5 million) in funding for Belarusian civil society in 2025. The EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Marta Kos, announced the funding during a meeting with Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Dec. 12. The EU4People of Belarus program will support independent media and civil society actors advocating for democracy in Belarus, and support education, culture, and small and medium enterprises in exile. The announcement coincided with the holding in Brussels of Belarus Days &#x2013; a series of events held between Dec. 9-13. Organized by the European External Action Service, European Commission, and European Parliament, the events brought together 150 Belarusian activists with European officials ahead of the 2025 presidential elections in Belarus in which no independent candidates were allowed to participate. In meetings with European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and EU High Representative Kaja Kallas, Tsikhanouskaya emphasized that the upcoming elections were a &#x201C;sham.&#x201D; She advocated the non-recognition of its results by EU member states, and pressuring the Lukashenko regime with more sanctions. Discussions also included the topic of regional security with EU Commissioner for Defense Andrius Kubilius. In addition, Minister-President of Flanders Matthias Diependaele promised an additional 100,000 euros to be allocated for media support. Since the widely disputed 2020 elections, the European Union has mobilized 170 million ($179 million) euros in support for the Belarusian people and pledged 3 billion euros in economic aid, contingent on a democratic transition in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-eu-imposes-new-sanctions-on-belarusian-officials-companies-supporting-regime/	2024-12-20T08:52:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187888765.jpg
Russia keeps key interest rate at 21%, defying expert expectations	Russia&apos;s Central Bank decided on Dec. 20 to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 21%, contrary to expert expectations of an increase, Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency reported. To rein in accelerating inflation fueled by war spending, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has been raising its interest rate from 7.5 percent in July 2023 to the current 21% - the highest level since the early 2000s. The tight monetary policy of Elvira Naniullina, the Central Bank&apos;s chief, has drawn criticism from businesses in Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex. On Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin also mentioned the problem, saying that some experts believe that the central bank should have started using tools other than rate hikes to fight inflation. Most analysts, including those polled by Russian media outlet RBC, anticipated a hike of 200 basis points to 23%. Ahead of the decision, major Russian banks raised savings deposit yields to 24-25% per annum, reflecting expectations of tighter monetary policy. The Central Bank said that, based on inflation and credit trends, the feasibility of raising the rate further would be assessed at its next meeting. Nabiullina has been involved in a conflict over rate hikes with Sergei Chemezov, the influential CEO of the state-owned defense giant Rostec. &quot;If we continue working this way, most enterprises will essentially go bankrupt,&quot; Chemezov said in October, commenting on increases in the Central Bank&apos;s rate. Former economic advisor and opposition politician Vladimir Milov told the Kyiv Independent in November that both sides have valid concerns. &quot;Chemezov is right that businesses will have to shut down at such a (high interest) rate,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;Nabiullina is right that the rate cannot be cut because in that case there will be hyperinflation like in Turkey.&quot; He continued that &quot;there is only one way out &#x2014; finish the war and withdraw Russian troops&quot; from Ukraine. The balance between controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability remains a critical challenge for Russia&#x2019;s Central Bank, as the war economy continues to strain the nation&apos;s financial system.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-keeps-key-interest-rate-at-21-defying-expert-expectations/	2024-12-20T08:31:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1831274509.jpg
Watchdog urges Zelensky to halt media intimidation, ensure press freedom	The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called on President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 19 to ensure press freedom in Ukraine and hold accountable those who intimidate journalists. This follows growing concerns about government actions that reportedly obstruct the work of media outlets, including online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda. In a letter, the CPJ highlighted a troubling pattern of restrictions over the past year, saying they &quot;curtail the operations of a free press&quot; and undermine Ukraine&#x2019;s democratic values. The organization also criticized a proposed bill in the Verkhovna Rada that could impose harsher criminal penalties for publishing information from public databases during martial law, saying that it threatens investigative journalism. The CPJ urged Zelensky to take immediate steps to protect media independence and address these issues, emphasizing that such actions are crucial for maintaining Ukraine&#x2019;s international standing. &quot;Any pressure on journalists is unacceptable,&quot; the letter said, calling for a commitment to ensure a free and safe environment for the press in Ukraine. The CPJ&#x2019;s appeal comes after Ukrainska Pravda accused Ukraine&apos;s President&apos;s Office in October of systematic attempts to influence its editorial policy. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) raised similar concerns earlier this year, reporting a decline in press freedom and increased state pressure on media autonomy, even as Ukraine rose slightly in RSF&#x2019;s annual press freedom index. Media watchdogs have expressed concerns that investigative journalists continue to face harassment and surveillance years after incidents that drew public and international condemnation.	https://kyivindependent.com/watchdog-urges-zelensky-to-halt-media-intimidation-ensure-press-freedom/	2024-12-20T07:13:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1247453296.jpg
Zaluzhnyi releases book 'My War,' first in planned trilogy	Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., released an autobiographical book titled &quot;My War,&quot; the first part of a planned trilogy, he announced on Dec. 20. The first part covers Zaluzhnyi&apos;s life from his childhood until the outbreak of the full-scale war. Zaluzhnyi started writing the book in March 2023 before he was replaced as commander-in-chief by General Oleksandr Syrskyi this February. Zaluzhnyi&apos;s wife edited the copy. &quot;This is a storybook for young people, to whom I want to convey an important truth: everything is possible in life if you really want it. Dream and follow your dreams,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. &quot;This book is about my war. First, the war with my own fears that prevent me from doing anything. Second, the war with people who prevent you from achieving your goals. And finally, the war against circumstances that become obstacles in life,&quot; he added. Zaluzhnyi is widely popular with both the military and the broader population due to his role in leading the resistance against Russia. According to a recent survey by the Future Research Foundation, Zaluzhnyi tops the list of trusted Ukrainians with 70.9%, leaving behind Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The other two books by Zaluzhnyi will be called &quot;Our War&quot; and &quot;Their War,&quot; the Babel media outlet reported in October, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The date of their release is unknown. Sources claimed that the trilogy does not mark the start of the ex-commander political career.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaluzhnyi-releases-my-war-book-first-in-trilogy/	2024-12-20T06:11:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162425886.jpg
Ukraine begins receiving first funds covered by frozen Russian assets proceeds	Ukraine is already receiving U.S. funds under the framework of the G7&apos;s $50 billion loan covered by profits from frozen Russian assets, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Dec 20. The World Bank&apos;s Board of Directors on Dec. 18 approved $2.05 billion in Development Policy Operation (DPO) grants, which is part of the U.S.&apos;s $20 billion contribution to the G7 loan. The DPO funds are co-financed by two sources: $1 billion from the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund (F.O.R.T.I.S. Ukraine FIF) and $1.05 billion from the Advancing Needed Credit Enhancement (ADVANCE) Ukraine Trust Fund, supported by the U.K. and Japan. &quot;We are grateful to our partners for their support on the path of economic development and reconstruction,&quot; Shmyhal said on Telegram. The DPO funds will focus on Ukraine&apos;s growth potential, supporting the railway sector, banking, and renewable energy generation, the World Bank said. Funding will also support efforts to increase domestic revenues. The EU said it would begin paying its portion of the G7 loan &#x2014; 18.1 billion euros ($18.8 billion) &#x2014; in January.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-begins-receiving-first-funds-covered-by-frozen-russian-assets-proceeds/	2024-12-20T05:50:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-2038537930.jpg
Russian missile attack damages 6 foreign embassies in Kyiv, Foreign Ministry says	A Russian missile attack on Kyiv damaged a number of foreign embassies on Dec. 20, Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said at a briefing. The embassies of Albania, Argentina, Palestine, North Macedonia, Portugal, and Montenegro are located in a building heavily damaged by the Russian strike. Russia launched a series of missile attacks against Kyiv earlier in the morning, killing one person, injuring 12, and causing damage across the city, local authorities reported. The capital was attacked with five ballistic missiles of the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model, all of which were shot down, the Air Force claimed.

Ukraine launched ATACMS, Storm Shadow against Russian chemical plant on Dec. 18, Moscow claims	Ukraine attacked the Rostov Oblast&apos;s Kamensky Combine, one of the largest chemical plants in Russia, with six U.S.-made ATACMS and four British Storm Shadow missiles on Dec. 18, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Dec. 20. In a later statement, the ministry claimed that its forces intercepted the six ATACMS and three of the four Storm Shadow missiles without commenting on the consequences of the attack. The claims could not be independently verified. The U.S. and the U.K. eased their restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of long-range missiles in November, with ATACMS and Storm Shadow strikes previously reported in two regions bordering Ukraine &#x2014; the Kursk and Bryansk oblasts. Yury Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, which also borders Ukraine, said on Dec. 18 that Russian air defense forces shot down 10 missiles over the region, adding that a residential building was damaged by fallen debris. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, said the time that the Kamensky Combine was hit in the attack. The Kamensky Combine &quot;is engaged in the production of rocket fuel, specializing in the manufacture of solid fuel components for rocket engines, in particular for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and intercontinental ballistic missiles using solid fuel,&quot; Kovalenko said on Telegram. The facility has been sanctioned by the EU, U.K., and U.S. for its role in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry further said that its Dec. 20 missile attack against Kyiv was a &quot;response&quot; to the strike against the chemical plant, claiming to target a Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) command center and a missile manufacturing plant. &quot;The goals have been achieved. All targets have been hit,&quot; the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. Ukraine said that all five ballistic missiles were intercepted over Kyiv, with fallen debris damaging residential and administrative buildings. One person was reported killed and 12 injured. Moscow has, on several occasions, presented its strikes against Ukrainian cities as &quot;retribution&quot; for Ukraine&apos;s actions, even though Russian forces have launched similar attacks throughout the full-scale war regardless of other developments.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launched-atacms-on-rostov-oblast-chemical-plant-on-dec-18-moscow-claims/	2024-12-20T05:03:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186337269--1-.jpg
Biden administration to announce its final $1.2 billion Ukraine aid package under USAI, Reuters reports	The Biden administration is planning to announce in the coming days its final aid package under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) worth around $1.2 billion, Reuters reported on Dec. 20, citing unnamed sources. The U.S. provided more than $60 billion in military aid to Ukraine under the Biden administration. The USAI is a Pentagon-led program that supplies arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. The package is expected to include air defense interceptors and artillery ammunition, one of the sources told Reuters. Separately, the U.S. is also providing assistance to Kyiv through the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), under which Washington supplies Ukraine with military equipment from existing U.S. military stockpiles. It is not immediately clear whether the Biden administration plans to announce further aid packages under the PDA. The New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 17 that the U.S. may run out of time to deliver the remaining $5.6 billion in military aid allocated to Ukraine under the PDA before Donald Trump takes office next month. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-announce-final-package-of-new-arms-for-ukraine-in-coming-days/	2024-12-20T04:19:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173586535.jpg
Lithuania's new PM, ministerial cabinet visit Kyiv	Lithuania&apos;s new ministerial cabinet arrived in Kyiv on Dec. 20, Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas said on X mere hours after Russia&apos;s missile attack against the capital. &quot;It is a privilege &amp; honor to be in Kyiv for my first visit as Prime Minister of Lithuania,&quot; Paluckas said, signalling continuation of Vilnius&apos;s decisively pro-Ukrainian stance. Lithuania has been a staunch supporter of Kyiv&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression, committing 0.25% of its GDP in future yearly military support for Ukraine. &quot;At Kyiv&#x2019;s Wall of Remembrance, with my Cabinet of Ministers, I paid my respects to the fallen heroes of Ukraine, men and women who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of their country, and by that &#x2013; for the freedom of Europe,&quot; Paluckas added. Paluckas took office on Dec. 12 after his Social Democratic Party (LSDP) won the October elections, replacing Ingrida Simonyte.

Bulgaria's parliament no longer supports signing Ukraine security deal	The Bulgarian parliament does not have enough votes to support the signing of Bulgaria&apos;s bilateral security treaty with Ukraine due to a shift in stance from the strongest party, Euractiv reported on Dec. 20. Former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, head of the conservative-populist Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party, suggested that the treaty is no longer beneficial amid expectations of peace talks. Debates about a potential ceasefire deal are coming into focus as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pledged to push Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table while Ukrainian officials signaled openness to a diplomatic resolution. Dimitar Glavchev, the prime minister of Bulgaria&apos;s caretaker government, was expected to sign the deal with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on Dec. 19. Glavchev unexpectedly backed out of signing the document, saying he needed to seek approval of the parliament first. Kyiv has already penned 25 bilateral security agreements with international partners based on a pledge made by the G7 last July. Bulgaria is one of the few EU countries that are yet to sign such a deal with Ukraine, alongside Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Malta, and Cyprus. &quot;Six months ago, we would have categorically supported such an agreement,&quot; said Borissov, whose party has supported Ukraine but now joined pro-Russian parties in opposition to the deal. Borissov pointed not only to the ongoing discussions about peace in the international arena but also to internal political reasons, saying that such a deal should be signed by an elected government rather than the caretaker cabinet. Glavchev conceded on Dec. 19 that he would not be signing the document amid the parliamentary opposition and would leave the step to the elected cabinet, the Sofia Globe reported. Borissov did not rule out supporting a bilateral security agreement signed by the next government if &quot;mutually beneficial&quot; to Sofia and Kyiv. The Glavchev cabinet will serve until a new government is appointed following the October elections, in which Borissov&apos;s GERB won 25.52% of the vote, the strongest result. Bulgaria has provided Ukraine with a variety of aid since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, but the matter has been contentious due to significant pro-Russian sentiment in the country and opposition from President Rumen Radev.	https://kyivindependent.com/bulgaria-parliament-doesnt-support-signing-ukraine-security-deal/	2024-12-20T03:29:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1228840330--1-.jpg
Ukraine retrieves bodies of 503 fallen soldiers	Ukraine has repatriated the bodies of 503 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War reported on Dec. 20. The Geneva Conventions stipulate that those who lose their lives during war are entitled to a dignified burial. As of early March, Ukraine has identified more than 2,800 bodies and body remains of fallen soldiers, according to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. The bodies of 403 soldiers were recovered from Donetsk Oblast, while 57 and 12 bodies were brought back from Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk oblasts, respectively. Another 31 bodies were repatriated from morgues in Russia. &quot;Law enforcement officials and forensic experts will identify the victims as soon as possible,&quot; the headquarters wrote in a post on Telegram. The operation to recover the fallen soldiers involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. In early December, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-retrieves-bodies-of-503-fallen-soldiers/	2024-12-20T03:19:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2161908116.jpg
Russia's GRU possibly behind cyberattack on Ukraine's government, SBU says	Hackers of Russia&apos;s military intelligence agency (GRU) could be behind a cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services, Volodymyr Karasteliov, the acting cybersecurity chief of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), said at a press conference on Dec. 20. In the largest cyberattack in recent months, several government services were targeted on Dec. 19, including state registers the Justice Ministry oversees, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said. Officials say that the cyberattack had been prepared for several months, without providing further details. Ukraine launched a criminal investigation. Stefanishyna did not specify which registers had been targeted. Later at a press conference, she said the cyberattack did not affect other state information systems. All state registers are currently suspended. &quot;All the Justice Ministry&apos;s data has been saved. Recovery is underway. Registers and all data will be restored. It is a matter of time,&quot; Stefanishyna added. Karasteliov said that the SBU could not yet rule out the possibility of a data leak. Russia has regularly targeted Ukrainian companies and government institutions with cyberattacks since the onset of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In August, a massive Russian cyberattack targeted Monobank, one of Ukraine&apos;s largest banks.	https://kyivindependent.com/gru-may-be-behind-cyberattack-on-ukraine/	2024-12-20T03:18:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-857697192.jpg
Russian missiles strike Kyiv on the eve of holiday season (Photos)	Russia launched five ballistic missiles against Ukraine&apos;s capital on the morning of Dec. 20, highlighting the stark contrast between the approaching holiday season and the realities of war. Though Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported that all projectiles were downed, missile debris fell in at least four of Kyiv&#x2019;s districts, starting fires across the city. At least one person was killed, and 11 injured as first responders continue to deal with the consequences of the attack. The Holosiivskyi district, south of the city center, was hit the hardest by the ballistic missile debris. Residential buildings, office buildings, and a hotel were damaged, with burning debris dropping on the streets and the roofs. Damage to critical infrastructure left 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities, 17 schools, and 13 kindergartens without heating amid December temperatures. Non-residential buildings in the Solomianskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts were also damaged by fallen debris. In the Pechersk district, a blast wave shattered precious stained glass windows of the St. Nicholas Roman Catholic church, the second-oldest Catholic church in Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missiles-strike-kyiv-on-the-eve-of-holiday-season/	2024-12-20T03:08:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190102415.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 7, injure 34 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed seven people and injured at least 34 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Dec. 20. Ukrainian forces downed 40 out of 65 Shahed-type drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as five Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles, the Air Force reported.

Russia captures 'Uspenivka pocket,' Ukraine denies reports of failed breakout	Ukrainian forces withdrew from the area of the Uspenivka and Trudove settlements in Donetsk Oblast after &quot;heavy defensive battles,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said on Dec. 20. The statement came in reaction to the DeepState monitoring group claiming that some troops did not manage to pull back after Russia captured the two settlements, completing the capture of the so-called Uspenivka pocket. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry announced the capture of Uspenivka on Dec. 20. Analysts have been long warning that the Russian advance threatens to encircle Ukrainian troops in the area. The sector lies roughly 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of the embattled front-line town of Kurakhove. &quot;Commander-in-Chief (Oleksandr Syrskyi) decided to withdraw Defense Forces units from the said area to avoid encirclement,&quot; the Khortytsia group of forces said, refuting claims about stranded soldiers. &quot;The units, which have been fighting heavy defensive battles against a superior force for a long time, carried out necessary maneuvers to avoid encirclement and continue performing tasks on the Kurakhove-Konstantynopolske axis.&quot; According to DeepState, Russia is regrouping in the newly captured area and attacking in the direction of the Shevchenko-Andriivka section, threatening to create a new pocket. Russian forces are now focusing their efforts on the nearby town of Andriivka. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Throughout the autumn, Russian forces have made operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, while advancing on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. Syrskyi said on Dec. 19 that Russian forces are carrying out simultaneous attacks along the front line, claiming that &quot;Ukrainian defense forces did not allow Russian forces to breach the defense and achieve operational success in any direction.&quot; Ukraine is increasingly on the back foot of the war as its resources grow thin, and the prospects of vitally important Western aid remain uncertain following the U.S. election victory of Donald Trump. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-captures-uspenivka/	2024-12-20T01:52:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187899885.jpg
Russian An-72 military transport plane damaged in blast near Moscow, Ukraine's intel claims	A power unit of a Russian An-72 military transport plane blew up at the Ostafyevo airfield in Moscow Oblast last week, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 20. The Russian Navy plane&apos;s main power unit exploded on Dec. 12, the military intelligence agency said without providing details on the cause or circumstances of the explosion. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The An-72 is a Soviet transport aircraft, developed by Antonov, Ukraine&apos;s largest aircraft manufacturing company. The plane is used mainly by the military and has an estimated price tag of around $4.5 million. HUR shared footage of the explosion without explicitly claiming responsibility for the incident. The Ostafyevo airfield is located over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. 0:00/1&#xD7;The footage purporting to show an explosion at the Ostafyevo airfield in Moscow Oblast on Dec. 12, 2024. (Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence)&quot;There will be just retribution for every war crime committed against the people of Ukraine,&quot; the agency said. Previously, Ukraine claimed responsibility for several aircraft sabotage operations inside Russia. In July, a HUR-coordinated operation resulted in damage to three Mi-28 and Ka-226 helicopters on the territory of the Moscow-based National Center of Helicopter Construction of Mil and Kamov, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent at the time. Another operation the same month reportedly led to the destruction of a Mi-8 helicopter at the Samara Kryazh military airfield in Samara Oblast, roughly 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the Ukrainian border.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-an-72-plane-blows-up-near-moscow/	2024-12-20T01:05:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Russian_Air_Force_-_Antonov_An-72.jpg
Orban to reportedly block EU's Russia sanctions extension until Trump takes office	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told EU leaders he plans to wait until U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office before deciding on an extension of the bloc&apos;s sanctions against Russia, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19, citing undisclosed sources. The EU sanctions must be extended by unanimous vote every six months, with the deadline for the next extension set at the end of January. The bloc imposed its 15th package of sanctions earlier this week, targeting Russia&apos;s shadow fleet and defense industry. Trump, Orban&apos;s ally who received the Hungarian prime minister at his Florida residence on Dec. 9, will be inaugurated on Jan. 20 after winning the November presidential election. Orban &quot;surprised&quot; his fellow EU leaders by deciding to block the extension during a summit in Brussels on Dec. 19 in what is considered a &quot;routine&quot; step, Bloomberg wrote. Talking to journalists, the Hungarian prime minister warned Europe against doing &quot;anything that would go against this future transatlantic relationship.&quot; Hungary&apos;s leader has consistently obstructed and delayed sanctions against Russia and military support for Kyiv. He has also lauded Trump&apos;s reelection, expressing expectations of a quick end to the war. Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House is causing concern in Kyiv and Europe, as the U.S. president-elect hinted at reducing support for Ukraine and pledged to get his country &quot;out&quot; &#xA0;of the war. The soon-to-be U.S. leader is expected to push European partners to take up greater responsibility for ensuring peace and security in Ukraine. This shift comes amid political instability in France and Germany and Russia&apos;s steady advances on the battlefield in Ukraine&apos;s east.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-to-reportedly-block-eus-russia-sanctions-extension-until-trump-takes-office/	2024-12-19T23:51:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190744266.jpg
Ukraine intercepts Russian sabotage groups attempting to push toward Kherson	Ukrainian soldiers repelled Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups as they were attempting to advance towards the city of Kherson overnight on Dec. 20, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. The reports come amid an anticipated large-scale Russian advance in Kherson Oblast. In early December, Russian troops were carrying out assaults in the southern region to gain a foothold on islands in the Dnipro River delta. Prokudin said earlier that Moscow has assembled &quot;300 boats to cross the river.&quot; Russian forces launched a massive aerial attack on Kherson and its outskirts from the occupied part of Kherson Oblast overnight on Dec. 20, targeting residential areas and critical infrastructure. One person was killed, and at least nine others were injured, according to the local authorities. Kherson and other regional settlements west of the Dnipro River have been subjected to near-daily Russian strikes since Ukraine liberated the area in November 2022 and Russian troops were pushed to the east of the river. Russian troops have intensified ground attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19. Moscow&apos;s forces keep on advancing in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to occupy the key towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Ukraine has also been building heavy fortifications near the southern city of Zaporizhzhia in preparations for a potential Russian offensive in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-intercepts-russian-sabotage-groups-attempting-to-push-towards-kherson/	2024-12-19T23:10:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186798554.jpg
Russian cyberattack targets Ukrainian government services	Russia conducted a cyberattack on Ukraine&apos;s government services on Dec. 19, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna said in a statement. In the largest cyberattack in recent months, several government services were targeted, including state registers the Justice Ministry oversees. Russia has regularly targeted Ukrainian companies and government institutions with cyberattacks since the onset of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In August, a massive Russian cyberattack targeted Monobank, one of Ukraine&apos;s largest banks. &quot;We are coordinating work on countering cyberattacks and restoring systems. It&apos;s already clear that the attack was made by Russia to disrupt the work of critically important infrastructure,&quot; Stefanishyna said on Dec. 19. &quot;(Russia)... is trying to use this situation... to sow panic among citizens of Ukraine and abroad,&quot; she said, adding that it will take up to two weeks for impacted government services to resume operation. In October, Microsoft warned that Russian hackers were targeting U.S. government officials. Cyberattacks and phishing emails are a part of Russia&apos;s hybrid war against the West over its support of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-cyberattack-targets-ukrainian-government/	2024-12-19T22:25:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-615824148.jpg

Russian losses exceed 750,000 troops, expected to surpass 1 million within 6 months, UK estimates	Russian military losses in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine have exceeded 750,000 Russian soldiers, and are expected to surpass 1 million Russian troops within six months, U.K. Under-Secretary of Defense Luke Pollard said on Dec. 19. The U.K.&apos;s latest estimate are in line with figures from Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, which, as of Dec. 19, sits at 768,220 troops lost since the start of the war. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. &quot;It is highly likely that they have sustained significant combat casualties, whilst only achieving limited tactical gains,&quot; Pollard told British parliamentarians on Dec. 19. Russia has gained ground in eastern Ukraine and Kursk Oblast in recent months but at the cost of heavy casualties. Russian losses reached record highs in November and December, with a daily high of 2,030 troops lost in November, marking the highest daily loss since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian losses exceeded 45,000 troops and $3 billion worth of equipment in November. Ukrainian authorities reported 700,000 Russian losses on Nov. 4, less than three months after they announced 600,000 Russian casualties Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures, though a Defense Ministry official recently let slip that the department received 48,000 requests to identify missing soldiers. According to joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, published on Dec. 6, journalists have identified the names of 82,050 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed in a rare statement that Ukraine had lost 43,000 soldiers on the battlefield since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In an attempt to mitigate casualties among Russian citizens, Moscow has also made an effort to recruit foreigners into their army. Russia has cooperated with North Korea, with Pyongyang reportedly dispatching 10,000-12,000 soldiers to assist Russia with its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-losses-to-surpass-1-million-in-months-exceed-750-000-uk-estimates/	2024-12-19T22:12:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/kch-0879-1663360221jewat.jpg
Explosions reported in Kyiv amid Russian missile attack	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a series of missile attacks towards Kyiv on the morning of Dec. 20. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv around 7 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that air defenses were operating over the city. Klitschko also reported that multiple cars were on fire in the Holosiivskyi district of the city due to the falling debris from a missile. Emergency crews are currently heading towards the scene. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned immediately prior that a MiG-31 Russian fighter jet, capable of firing Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, had taken off from a Russian air base. No additional information was immediately available as to any damage or casualties caused by the missile attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/explosions-reported-in-kyiv-amid-russian-missile-attack/	2024-12-19T21:25:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1796953252.jpg
Ukraine must decide between 'carrying on the fight or looking to negotiate ceasefire,' Blinken says	In a wide ranging interview with MSNBC on Dec. 19, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke about the prospects for a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, as well as support for the embattled country ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in January. &quot;I want to make sure that we&#x2019;re giving the incoming administration and the Ukrainians the strongest possible hand to play going into 2025,&quot; Blinken said in an interview on MSNBC Morning Joe. &quot;Ukrainians have to make fundamental decisions about carrying on the fight or looking to negotiate and try to bring this to a ceasefire. The fundamental question is whether Russia is prepared to do that and to do that in good faith.&quot; &quot;If it moves to that, we want to make sure that the Ukrainians and the Trump administration have the best hand to play to cut the strongest possible deal. And that means trying to reinforce Ukraine&#x2019;s position on the battlefield,&quot; Blinken added. The outgoing official&apos;s comments come as Trump has pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Russia&apos;s war and negotiate a quick peace deal. Ukrainian officials have urged the president-elect to maintain support and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach in dealings with Russia The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12, citing undisclosed official sources, that Trump wants European troops to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump reportedly made the comments during his Dec. 7 meeting with Zelensky and French President Macron in Paris. &quot;If this gets to a place where there is a ceasefire, and it&#x2019;s a ceasefire that&#x2019;s on just and durable terms, that would be a good thing. But for it to be durable, there has to be some kind of assurance that Russia is not simply going to rest, refit, and reattack,&quot; Blinken added during the interview. During a visit to Brussels to meet with European leaders on Dec. 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the idea of freezing the conflict without effective security guarantees, adding that doing so would &quot;buy time&quot; for Russia to regroup ahead of another attack. On Dec. 18, Zelensky said he was &quot;discussing ideas with European leaders&quot; on the potential deployment of European peacekeeping forces to the embattled country. On Dec. 13, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said that Kyiv is not prepared to enter negotiations with Russia as it lacks sufficient Western support to engage from a position of strength.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-must-decide-between-carrying-on-the-fight-or-looking-to-negotiate-ceasefire-blinken-says/	2024-12-19T20:06:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170662132.jpg
5 injured in Russian attack on residential building in Kryvyi Rih	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile struck a two-story residential building in the city of Kryvyi Rih overnight on Dec. 19, injuring five people, including a child. A 15-year old girl and a man have been found and rescued from under the rubble. The windows of a nearby 10-story building were shattered, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak said in a post to social media. Three other people between the ages of 38 and 82 were also injured, the head of military administration in Kryvyi Rih, Oleksandr Vilkul confirmed on Dec. 20. All of the injured are in moderate condition. Kryvyi Rih was previously attacked about a day earlier in a blitz that targeted several cities across Ukraine, killing one and injuring eight. Air attacks against Ukrainian cities are a regular occurrence, with Russia targeting residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, including critical energy infrastructure. Ukraine has struggled to maintain its air defenses against the high numbers of drones and missiles Russia launches. President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to Western allies during meetings with European leaders in Brussels on Dec. 18, requesting an additional 19 air defense systems to protect critical infrastructure. Denmark pledged $292 million to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defenses on Dec. 19 as Russian attacks continue.	https://kyivindependent.com/kryvyi-rih-residential-building-hit-in-russian-rocket-attack-victims-excavated/	2024-12-19T18:43:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/photo_2024-12-19_18-53-29.jpg
5 killed, 7 injured in fire at detention facility housing war deserters in Russia's Sakha Republic	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Five people have been killed and a further seven injured in a fire at a detention center in the city of Yakutsk, which houses Russian soldiers who deserted their units during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials reported. The fire broke out around 2 a.m. local time on Dec. 20, Sakha Republic military authorities said. At least seven people have been hospitalized having suffered smoke inhalation. The identities of those killed is still being established, authorities said. No information was immediately available as to the cause of the fire, or the extent of the damage caused. The Kyiv Independent cannot independently verify details surrounding the incident. Desertion rates during Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion remain relatively high amid Russia&apos;s mounting casualty rates. Although up-to-date statistics on desertion are not readily available, the Russian independent media outlet Mediazona reported in April 2024 that Russian courts had received over 8,200 cases related to mobilization since the start of the war. Yakutsk is located in Russia&apos;s far-east, and is located about 450 km south of the arctic circle. Given the region&apos;s harsh weather conditions, Yakutsk and its surrounding region served as a key location for housing political prisoners during the rule of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-killed-7-injured-in-fire-at-detention-facility-housing-war-deserters-in-russias-sakha-republic/	2024-12-19T18:05:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1576124699.jpg
Putin says full-scale invasion of Ukraine should have been 'earlier,' says he's open to meeting Trump	In a marathon press conference lasting over four hours on Dec. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that a full-scale invasion of Ukraine should have begun &apos;earlier.&apos; When asked what he would have done differently if he could go back to February 2022, the month Russia launched its all-out war against Ukraine, Putin responded, &quot;Knowing what&apos;s happening now, back in 2022, I would&apos;ve thought the decision ought to have been taken earlier.&quot; He continued, &quot;We ought to have started getting ready for those developments and the special military operation before.&quot; The Kremlin leader also addressed questions about benefits for soldiers involved in what Russia calls a &quot;special military operation&quot; in Ukraine, particularly in relation to payments for injuries or fatalities. This issue has become a significant point of concern in Russia, reflecting the growing anxiety over mounting casualties and the reasons many Russians continue to enlist. A joint investigation by the BBC Russia and Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, has identified over 83,000 Russian troops killed in the war, though the actual toll is believed to be much higher. Putin also expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at any time to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. However, he reiterated Moscow&#x2019;s unwavering demands for a peace agreement, including the rejection of any territorial concessions and a firm stance against Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership. Responding to a question about whether he had learned anything about himself during the war, Putin asserted, &quot;I believe that Russia has become much stronger in the past two or three years. Why? Because we are becoming a truly sovereign country. We depend on few people. We are able to stand on our own feet from an economic point of view. We are strengthening our defense capability.&quot; Despite almost three years of ongoing war and the toll of Western sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s economy, Putin attempted to reassure the Russian public, particularly those frustrated by the war and rising inflation. He claimed that Russia was winning the war and that the economy was stable and even growing. However, in a rare admission, he acknowledged that Russia&apos;s inflation rate of 9.3 percent, as reported by the Central Bank chief, was &quot;an alarming signal.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-says-full-scale-invasion-of-ukraine-should-have-been-earlier-says-hes-open-to-meeting-trump/	2024-12-19T17:31:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190074168.jpg
Russian court orders two-month detention for suspect in General Kirillov assassination	A Moscow court ruled on Dec. 19 to place the suspect in the killing of General Igor Kirillov in pre-trial detention for two months. The court announced the decision on its Telegram channel. The suspect, originally from Uzbekistan, faces charges of committing a terrorist act resulting in death, according to a notice on the court&apos;s website. On Dec. 18, Russian security forces detained two suspects over the assassination of a top Kremlin general and his assistant in Moscow. Kirillov was killed in Moscow on Dec. 17, with a bomb attached to a scooter. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the attack. Kirillov, 54, served as the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense unit. One day before his assassination, Ukrainian prosecutors charged him in absentia for deploying prohibited chemical weapons during Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A Kyiv Independent investigation published in August revealed that Russian forces have increasingly used gas attacks against Ukrainian troops. Kirillov&#x2019;s involvement in these operations led to sanctions from both the U.K. and Canada. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 17, a source from Ukraine&#x2019;s SBU described Kirillov as a war criminal and a &quot;completely legitimate target,&quot; as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-orders-two-month-detention-for-suspect-in-general-kirillov-assassination/	2024-12-19T15:59:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189847816.jpg
EU leaders call for more military aid to Kyiv, vow any future decisions won't exclude Ukraine	European Union leaders reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine at a Dec. 19 summit in Brussels, emphasizing that decisions about the war-torn country&#x2019;s future must involve Kyiv and its European allies. The meeting, attended by President Volodymyr Zelensky, highlighted solidarity with Ukraine as it has been fighting against Russian aggression fo over 1,000 days. &quot;Only Ukraine as the aggressed country can legitimately define what peace means &#x2014; and if and when the conditions are met for credible negotiations,&quot; said Antonio Costa, president of the European Council. &quot;So now is not the time to speculate about different scenarios &#x2013; now is the time to strengthen Ukraine for all scenarios.&quot; The European Council urged EU member states to immediately enhance military aid to Ukraine. Leaders called for faster delivery of air defense systems, ammunition, and missiles, as well as additional training and equipment for new Ukrainian brigades. Concerns linger over U.S. foreign policy as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20. Trump has promised to end the war quickly and has emphasized his rapport with Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising fears in Europe about a potential deal unfavorable to Ukraine. Speculation is growing in Europe about potential peace talks in early 2025 and the possible involvement of European peacekeepers to enforce any agreement. However, EU leaders are cautious, aiming to avoid revealing their strategies to Russia. For now, their focus remains on bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s position in case Zelensky chooses to pursue negotiations. In Brussels, EU leaders maintained their stance: &quot;Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, nothing about security in Europe without Europeans.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-leaders-call-for-more-military-aid-to-kyiv-vow-any-future-decisions-wont-exclude-ukraine/	2024-12-19T14:24:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Zelensky blasts Putin’s Oreshnik threats, calling him ‘dumbass’	Key developments on Dec. 19: At a press conference in Brussels on Dec. 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s recent threats of using the new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv to test Western air defense systems in what he called a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West. Putin proposed the &quot;high-tech duel&quot; during his annual press conference on Dec. 19. He suggested launching an Oreshnik at a site in Kyiv while challenging the West to deploy their air defenses to intercept it, claiming the missile was unbeatable. &quot;Do you think this is an adequate person? They are just thugs,&quot; Zelensky said while commenting on Putin&apos;s threats. Later on, Zelensky published a video clip with Putin&apos;s suggestion about a &quot;duel&quot; on X, calling him a &quot;dumbass.&quot; &quot;People are dying, and he thinks it&#x2019;s &apos;interesting.&apos; Dumbass,&quot; Zelensky wrote. Putin&apos;s remarks followed his earlier threats to use Oreshnik missiles to strike at &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv. Russia first launched an Oreshnik at the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. The strike was accompanied by a Russian propaganda campaign claiming the attack was carried out in response to the U.S. and U.K.&apos;s decision to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia and aimed at undermining Western support for Kyiv. Zelensky also commented on the 2022 Istanbul negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and Putin&apos;s peace proposal back then, dismissing them as a sham. &#x201C;He simply offered Ukraine to surrender, freeze the conflict, shift allegiance to Russia, and give up our independence,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;This person calls these some kind of agreements. He is just an old fantasist living in his own aquarium.&#x201D; The draft of the Istanbul agreement was published in full by The New York Times in June. According to it, both sides agreed to exclude Ukraine&apos;s Crimea from the treaty, leaving it under Russian occupation without Ukraine recognizing Russian sovereignty over it while the status of other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine was to be decided in later talks between presidents Zelensky and Putin. Ukraine offered to abandon aspirations to join NATO or any other military alliance, but the treaty allowed Kyiv to enter the EU. Russia also demanded the lifting of all sanctions, repealing Kyiv&apos;s laws related to language and national identity, and limiting Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that American and European participation in possible peace negotiations with Russia is crucial while rejecting the idea of freezing the conflict. Ahead of the anticipated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s focus on ending the war after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Zelensky expressed hope that Europe would be involved in the effort, sharing a strong, united stance. Zelensky warned against granting Moscow a temporary break it seeks through a ceasefire, advocating instead for concerted international pressure to achieve an actual ending of Russia&apos;s war. &#x201C;We need coordinated work for a lasting peace, not just the suspension of hostilities that Putin seeks in order to buy time,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;We cannot live with a frozen conflict. When it comes to ceasefire, people know what comes after. How everything will end. You have to know what tomorrow brings in order to have a ceasefire.&#x201D; Zelensky also highlighted the role of the so-called Global South nations, including China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil, in supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity and influencing Russia. He urged Europe to recognize and leverage these countries&apos; potential to advance peace, noting their alignment with the principles of territorial sovereignty. Reports of Trump&#x2019;s intentions to end the war, potentially by pressuring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia or relinquish its NATO aspirations, have raised concerns among Ukraine supporters and in Kyiv. Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war in &#x201C;24 hours,&#x201D; but he has not elaborated on his approach. On Dec. 12, he reiterated his belief that European troops should lead efforts to monitor any potential ceasefire, saying that Europe must assume greater responsibility in countering Russian aggression. The EU, however, does not foresee negotiations or a ceasefire in the near future, according to a high-ranking EU official who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18. Ukraine&apos;s Navy and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out a combined strike against the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Dec. 19, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Russian authorities and Telegram channels reported explosions and fire at the facility earlier the same day, connecting it to a Ukrainian drone attack. The Novoshakhtinsk facility is &quot;the only oil refinery operating&quot; in the region, the General Staff said. It reportedly produces up to 7.5 million tons of oil products annually and specializes in fuel production. The city of Novoshakhtinsk lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Russo-Ukrainian border and over 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the front line. Initially, SBU drones attacked the facility to distract Russian air defenses, providing a &quot;window&quot; for Ukrainian-made missiles to strike the facility, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The strike resulted in a massive fire and caused significant damage, the source claimed. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said the fire had been extinguished as of 6:45 a.m. local time. One person was reportedly injured in the region due to falling drone debris. The fire also affected the refinery&apos;s ELOU-AVT-2.5 catalytic cracking unit, according to the General Staff. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Ukraine has previously targeted the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery with drone strikes. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces claimed that a July attack on the refinery destroyed &#xA0;1.5 million tons of oil and oil products worth $540 million. The refinery partially shut down after an attack in March. Ukrainian forces regularly target Russian oil depots in addition to attacks on weapons factories and military airfields. Fossil fuel exports are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. International sanctions are affecting growing prices in Russia, but there are also shortcomings by Russian authorities, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference and a call-in program on Dec. 19, state news agency TASS reported. Russian officials have largely dismissed the importance of Western sanctions imposed over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, boasting about a strong and resilient economy. While independent observers mostly agreed that the sanctions fell short of the desired effect, there are mounting warning signs regarding Russia&apos;s economy ahead of 2025. &quot;The sanctions are having an effect, but they are not of key importance,&quot; Putin said when talking about the surging inflation and prices in Russia. The country&apos;s annual inflation rate rose 9.2-9.3% while the ruble oscillates around 100 to the U.S. dollar. Russia&apos;s central bank sought to curb inflation by instituting the highest interest rates &#x2013; 21% &#x2013; since the early 2000s. According to Putin, inflation is driven by the supply not keeping up with the demand and the rising prices of some products globally. Many experts also connected the development to increased defense spending as Russia invests record sums in its full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;Some experts believe that the central bank could have used tools unrelated to raising the key interest rate more effectively and earlier,&quot; Putin said. &quot;The central bank began doing this in the summer, but these experts believe this could and should have been done earlier.&quot; The combined effect of sanctions and inflation is beginning to threaten the Russian economy in various sectors, including automotive, aviation, and retail. This development comes amid a growing push by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to launch negotiations in Ukraine as soon as possible, though Moscow has shown little interest in peace talks. Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces reported on Dec. 19 that they had killed 12 North Korean soldiers and injured 20 others, preventing their advance in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. Ukraine&#x2019;s Special Operations Forces used drones and an Mk-19 grenade launcher to counter the North Korean soldier&apos;s attempt to advance, according to the released statement and video. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) earlier reported that 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or injured during ground assaults on Dec. 14-15. A total of at least 100 North Korean troops have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine, a South Korean lawmaker said after an intelligence briefing, the BBC reported on Dec. 19. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The use of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s ground operations was confirmed earlier in November, but their involvement has intensified recently. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean soldiers were actively participating in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and had suffered their first casualties. President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russia was trying to conceal the extent of the losses among the North Korean soldiers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-zelensky-blasts-putins-oreshnik-threats-calling-him-dumbass/	2024-12-19T12:44:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2190054860.jpg
G7 discusses slashing Russian oil price cap, complete ban, Bloomberg reports	The G7 countries are considering tightening the price cap on Russian oil, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 19, citing its sources. The move comes as Russia&apos;s fossil fuel industry remains a primary source of funding for its war against Ukraine. Discussions reportedly include lowering the current $60-per-barrel cap to approximately $40 or even implementing a complete ban on Russian oil supplies. While talks are ongoing, no consensus has been reached, according to Bloomberg&apos;s sources. Under the existing terms of the price cap, Western operators are permitted to insure and transport Russian oil only if it is sold below the established threshold. The G7 aims to strike a balance between limiting Russia&apos;s revenues and mitigating potential impacts on global oil markets and maritime security. The cap was originally implemented to curtail Moscow&apos;s oil profits while avoiding a surge in global oil prices. With oil prices softening amid projections of a global surplus in 2025, the G7 appears more willing to consider aggressive measures. Ukraine has also targeted Russia&apos;s oil infrastructure through drone strikes, further disrupting production. Several Russian refineries, including those in Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk, have reduced or suspended operations due to the combined impact of sanctions and Ukrainian attacks. The sector has been forced to sell fuel at a discount and operate under high interest rates, adding strain to its operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-discusses-slashing-russian-oil-price-cap-complete-ban-bloomberg-reports/	2024-12-19T12:39:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1258888534.jpg
Can Ukraine sustain its F-16 fleet if Trump halts US aid?	As the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden rushes to provide last-minute aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office in January, the State Department has recently announced a $266 million maintenance sales package for Ukraine&apos;s F-16 fighter jets. Trump has made no public comments about the Ukrainian F-16 fleet, but his expected intent to reduce support for Kyiv and get his country &quot;out&quot; of the war poses a question: what will become of Ukraine&apos;s U.S.-made jets if Washington withdraws? F-16s, the fifth-generation fighter jets, have been vital in Ukraine&#x2019;s effort to build a modern Air Force. Taking them out of the game could weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s air defense, leaving the country more vulnerable to Russian aerial strikes. The Netherlands and Denmark were the first to provide Ukraine with the F-16s earlier this year, with the Danish government announcing the delivery of their second batch on Dec. 7. Norway and Belgium also pledged to provide the aircraft from their stocks as they pivot toward more advanced F-35s. Donald Trump, during a campaign rally at Riverfront Sports, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, US on Oct. 9, 2024. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)While the U.S. has not provided any planes from its arsenal, it plays a key role in training Ukrainian pilots and providing maintenance support. The recently announced U.S. military sales package includes a wide range of maintenance-related systems, such as weapons software, spare parts for jets, and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Since the F-16 is a U.S.-made system, European allies need Washington&#x2019;s authorization to be able to provide the jets to Ukraine. This means the Trump administration could, in theory, halt even the European supplies of F-16s. If the U.S. stops all further F-16 upkeep aid, Ukraine&apos;s European allies will likely be capable of compensating if they increase funding. &quot;Europeans can compensate for it if they want to, but Americans must approve their third-party transfer,&quot; Peter Layton, a former Australian Air Force officer, associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), and visiting fellow at Griffith Asia Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;If the Trump administration withdraws authorization for the use of F-16s, the U.S. could block any future aid,&quot; the expert explained. &quot;In this case, the situation will be very difficult.&quot; According to Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at RUSI, another issue is the limited personnel that can train and maintain F-16s in European countries.

(Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)A group of Ukrainian military personnel completed a basic training course for piloting F-16 fighter jets in the U.K., the British Royal Air Force (RAF) reported on Oct. 22, 2024. (Royal Air Force (RAF)/X)&#x201C;Unlike the Americans, Europeans don&#x2019;t have as many personnel available, and most of them have been redeployed from flying and maintaining their F-16s to managing their new F-35 aircraft,&quot; Layton said. &quot;So, Europeans would need to put the personnel back from the new aircraft to assist Ukrainians with the older F-16s. I think this would directly impact European capabilities for using F-35 jets.&quot; Many observers have pointed out that the F-16s are not wonder weapons &#x2013; they can&#x2019;t, in their current numbers, ensure Ukraine&#x2019;s superiority in the air. But these jets are still valuable assets that enhance Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities. F-16s are used in both offensive and defensive operations. The aircraft have been used for intercepting Russian missiles and drones during aerial strikes against Ukraine. They could also be deployed to launch missiles and bombs at Russian positions along the front line. &quot;If you take F-16s essentially out of the equation for now, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t see significant changes in Ukraine&#x2019;s defensive capabilities in the short term,&quot; Bronk said. Ukrainian pilots are still overcoming initial obstacles related to adopting a new weapons system, approaches, and style, &quot;particularly in how they manage the radar system,&quot; Bronk said, referring to the case of a Ukrainian F-16 crashing during a mission in August. &quot;It&#x2019;s also a challenge to transfer experienced pilots to F-16s for tasks like intercepting Shaheds or cruise missiles at night. The workflow is very different from the MiG-29 or Su-27, for example,&quot; the expert added. In the medium term, however, Ukraine could see a &quot;significant degradation in the effort to build an Air Force,&quot; Bronk said. Ukraine could potentially consider European solutions, such as the Mirage 2000 jets pledged by France or Swedish Gripen jets. Ukraine is expected to receive only three Mirage jets in early 2025, while the possible delivery of Swedish Gripen jets hasn&#x2019;t been approved yet. However, Bronk notes that the Mirage 2000 is not ideal for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense needs due to its radar missile limitations. Meanwhile, transferring to yet another platform would require more time and effort, costing Ukraine precious time.	https://kyivindependent.com/can-ukraine-sustain-its-f-16-fleet-if-trump-halts-us-aid/	2024-12-19T12:19:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2165218556.jpg
Belarus sentences 2 Belarusians, Ukrainian to 11-25 years for alleged terrorism	Two Belarusians and one Ukrainian were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 11 to 25 years by Belarusian authorities for their alleged involvement in preparing terrorist acts, the Viasna Human Rights Center reported on Dec. 19. Since the 2020 presidential election in Belarus, which saw Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claim victory in a falsified vote, the country has witnessed a severe crackdown on dissent. Thousands of opposition leaders, activists, and ordinary citizens have been arrested, tortured, and jailed. Belarusian prosecutors claimed that two men from the group allegedly tried to blow up a section of the railroad, while the third one&apos;s actions were classified as &quot;illegal trafficking of explosives.&quot; The sentences for each individual were not disclosed. The detention of these three men alongside three other individuals was announced by the Belarusian KGB on Sept. 11. On the same day, a government propaganda film about the group was aired on state-controlled television. In the film, some of the detainees appeared beaten, others were in chains. According to Viasna, the propaganda film alleged that one of the detainees contacted Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBUt) seeking to fight for Ukraine. He was allegedly told by the SBU that his skills were needed in Belarus. The sentences come as Lukashenko prepares for the January 2025 presidential election, seeking a seventh term after 30 years in power. Lukashenko has recently pardoned prisoners convicted of extremism, claiming that it was a &quot;humane gesture&quot; toward those who had &quot;gone astray, though these individuals were widely seen as victims of repression following the rigged 2020 election.	https://kyivindependent.com/6-belarusian-ukrainian-activists-sentenced-to-up-to-25-years-in-belarus-for-alleged-terrorism/	2024-12-19T12:14:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1228273652.jpg
One killed, one in captivity: The tragic story of two brothers forever separated by Russia’s war	Warning: This article contains descriptions of graphic scenes. For a moment, Oksana Latanska could not believe her eyes when she looked down at a cold, little body, gray from dust and ashes. It hardly resembled the little boy that she knew so well and whom she saw almost every weekend at the rallies calling for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) from Russian captivity. &#xA0; Only his golden-blonde curls helped her recognize the body, bringing the worst nightmare into reality. It was Maksym Shaulskyi, her friend&apos;s son, who was only 12 years old when a Russian missile strike on his hometown of Kryvyi Rih took his life on Sept. 21. The aftermath of a Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, on Sept. 21, 2024. The attack killed three people, including a 12-year-old boy, and injured three others. (Serhii Lysak / Telegram)With a population of around 660,000, Kryvyi Rih is the second most populous city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Due to its proximity to the embattled Donetsk Oblast, the city has suffered multiple deadly attacks by Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war. &quot;I saw what was left from our sunshine. It was excruciating,&quot; Latanska told the Kyiv Independent. The strike also killed Maksym&#x2019;s 75-year-old grandmother, Valentyna Shaulska, and two more civilians, according to the local authorities. According to Latanska, the boy&apos;s biggest dream was to see his older brother Mykyta, one of the defenders of now-occupied Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast, who has been in Russian captivity since 2022. But that dream was shattered by a Russian missile hitting a residential neighborhood of a peaceful city. &quot;It&apos;s a horrible tragedy,&quot; Latanska says. &quot;Maksym was such a wonderful boy&#x2026; Our little sunshine.&quot; Maksym is one of the 578 Ukrainian children killed by the Russian war since Feb. 24, 2022, according to the national database. The U.N. estimates that at least 11,743 civilians have been killed and 24,614 injured since the start of the full-scale invasion. However, the actual number of civilian casualties is likely much higher as it doesn&#x2019;t account for fatalities in the Russian-occupied territories that are inaccessible to international organizations. Latanska, who heads the Steel Guard of Kryvyi Rih non-profit that advocates for the release of Ukrainian POWs, says it was the &quot;common grief&quot; that united her and Shaulskyi&apos;s family shortly after Russia&#x2019;s all-out war began. Latanska&apos;s son, Ukrainian soldier Vitalii, served in the same National Guard unit with Mykyta Shaulskyi. They both defended Mariupol in the spring of 2022 during the brutal Russian siege of the city, both ending up in Russian captivity at the age of 22. Former service member herself, Latanska says that Maksym and Mykyta&#x2019;s mother, Nataliia Shaulska, joined the Armed Forces when one of her sons was already in captivity. The family also has another adult son who lives in Dnipro, according to Latanska. Their entire family regularly took part in the local weekend rallies, part of a national movement aimed at keeping the release of the prisoners on everyone&apos;s agenda. Maksym Shaulskyi&apos;s family in a photo posted on Sep.23, 2024. (Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine / Telegram)Little Maksym rarely skipped them, Latanska says. He and Mykyta were very close, she says, adding that it was the boy&apos;s biggest dream to see and hug his big brother again. Photos of Maksym holding Mykyta&apos;s portrait and calling for his release during one of the rallies in Kryvyi Rih went viral following his death. While Latanska&apos;s son Vitalii was released from captivity in June, Mykyta is still a prisoner of Russia. He is now 25. Latanska says they hope Mykyta will be released soon, but they worry about how he will receive the devastating news that Russia killed his brother and grandmother while he was in captivity. The mother of Mykyta and Maksym, Nataliia Shaulska, returned to civilian life nearly three weeks before her youngest son was killed. She was outside Kryvyi Rih when the missile struck their neighborhood, almost completely destroying their house. &quot;Otherwise, the entire family would have been gone,&quot; Latanska says. She rushed to the site the moment she learned about the tragedy: &quot;When I was looking at his (Maksym&apos;s) body, I thought that the monster who launched the missile might also have children, maybe even of Maksym&apos;s age.&quot; &quot;I thought about how he landed his plane at a Russian airfield, walked into a bakery, and bought some pastry for his family. He walked home and kissed his wife and his sleeping 12-year-old son. And for me, the only fitting punishment is from God, who will take away his family in the most painful way possible, so he feels it himself.&quot; &quot;But even that would not be enough because it would not bring our boy back,&quot; she went on. &quot;No punishment for Russia would be enough.&quot; Women embrace each other as they visit a designated area for commemorating fallen Ukrainian and foreign fighters during the Independence Day of Ukraine, in the Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine on Aug. 24, 2024.

Ukraine won't extend Russian gas transit, Zelensky confirms	Ukraine will not extend the transit agreement for Russian gas through its territory, set to expire on Dec. 31, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Dec. 19 during a press conference in Brussels. The decision previously prompted concerns from Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Austria, whose state-owned energy companies called for the continuation of gas transit through Ukraine in a joint declaration. Zelensky said that Ukraine would not allow Moscow to &#x201C;earn additional billions&#x201D; while continuing its aggression against Ukraine. &#x201C;We will not engage in extending the transit of Russian gas. We will not give (Russia) the opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood,&#x201D; Zelensky said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, addressing the issue during his annual press conference on the same day, confirmed the end of the contract, expressing confidence in the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom&apos;s ability to endure the loss. &#x201C;This contract will no longer exist. Everything is clear. We will survive, Gazprom will survive,&#x201D; Putin said. While the European Union has made efforts to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many countries, including Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria, remain reliant on Russian gas.

Following discussions with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said that Ukraine is open to negotiating gas transit agreements for non-Russian sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-extend-russian-gas-transit-zelensky-confirms/	2024-12-19T10:54:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast boost Russia's manpower, despite vulnerabilities	North Korean troops fighting in Kursk Oblast are especially vulnerable to drones but still managed to help Moscow advance a few kilometers in the partially Ukrainian-occupied region in southwest Russia, according to Western military experts analyzing open-source data. The assessment of drone vulnerability differs from an on-the-ground testimony obtained by the Kyiv Independent, in which a Special Forces serviceman disclosed how North Korean troops were well-protected by Russia&#x2019;s electronic warfare, which effectively counters drones. The contrasting evaluations highlight the opacity of reports from Kursk Oblast, where a third party&#x2019;s troops entered the battle. There are about 12,000 North Korean troops deployed in Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion in August to bring the war to Russia, a senior Ukrainian official familiar with the intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. Some of them were already sent on assault missions, and they have proven to lack experience with most modern weapons, especially various types of drones, the official added. Each North Korean platoon accompanies a larger company of Russian paratroopers to reclaim Ukrainian positions in Kursk Oblast, according to the official. In exchange for the troop transfer, Russia is paying over $2,000 for each North Korean soldier, though it is unclear how much is allocated for the individual soldier and the Pyongyang government, the official added. Russia could also transfer technologies to North Korea to produce and improve &#x201C;weapon characteristics,&#x201D; a move that could further deepen Moscow-Pyongyang ties, the official said, adding that North Korea is already improving its ballistic missiles by observing Russia&apos;s use of them in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent couldn&#x2019;t independently verify the information shared by the official. The assessments come a few days after Ukraine&#x2019;s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 14 that Russia had begun deploying &#x201C;a significant number&#x201D; of North Korean soldiers for assault operations in Kursk Oblast. Russia has launched waves of counterattacks since September to reclaim the thin Ukrainian-occupied salient in Kursk Oblast. The Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) reported the fighting with Pyongyang&#x2019;s troops &#x2013; in particular from the 94th Separate brigade of the North Korean army &#x2013; to be in the lower part of the Ukrainian-controlled salient, as close as a few kilometers from the Ukrainian border, in Kursk Oblast. A South Korean lawmaker told the media on Dec. 19 that at least 100 North Korean troops have been killed and another 1,200 wounded amid the lack of experience with terrain and drone warfare. A senior U.S. military official, cited in a Dec. 17 Associated Press article, said that a couple hundred North Korean troops have thus far been killed or wounded in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian officials briefed on the intelligence and Western military analysts named drones to be a challenge for North Korean troops, thereby sustaining heavy casualties. Not knowing how to protect themselves from Ukrainian Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs), the reality of the first drone war has been &#x201C;a new challenge&#x201D; for the North Korean troops, a source in the HUR military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent. The HUR source said that Russia set up additional positions to counter drones to protect North Korean troops from the vulnerability.

(Oksana Parafeniuk for The Washington Post via Getty Images)A serviceman in the Ukrainian Special Forces sabotage and reconnaissance group that identifies as UA_REG TEAM, deployed in Kursk Oblast, said that North Korean troops are well-protected by the umbrella of electronic warfare from drones. &#x201C;From the first day, electronic warfare works quite well at places where the North Koreans are entrenched, which prevents you from conducting quality reconnaissance,&#x201D; the serviceman, who introduced himself as Yaroslav, told the Kyiv Independent. North Korean troops hold a narrow section of the front where they can outnumber Ukrainian troops, according to Yaroslav, who declined to disclose his last name due to security concerns. Their good command of tactics and physical fitness allow them to quickly evade or escape open terrain, he added. &#x201C;(North Korean troops) move quickly in a column one at a time until the first shot is fired and then quickly form a line to maneuver,&#x201D; Yaroslav said. The serviceman also suggested that Russia had given them orders not to leave behind any bodies of North Korean troops, given how quickly they are cleared compared to the bodies of regular Russian soldiers. Ukraine has slowly been losing ground in Kursk Oblast since September, with a senior General Staff official confirming to Reuters in late November that it had lost over 40% of the territory it previously captured in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian soldiers are increasingly pessimistic about the fate of the Kursk operation, with a growing number questioning the cost of an incursion into another country&#x2019;s territory when the defense of one&#x2019;s own land is uncertain. While confirming that the troops featured in videos of at least two separate assault operations surfacing the internet since Dec. 14 are certainly North Koreans is difficult, the troops operate differently and &quot;in a manner that would be expected of North Koreans,&quot; according to Pasi Paroinen at Finland-based open-source analytical organization Black Bird Group. The apparent North Korean infantry is &quot;very well-spaced out,&#x201D; which helps reduce casualties from indirect artillery or drone fires and makes it harder to target them at once, Paroinen said. The North Korean troops are also moving as a cohesive unit in larger numbers than observed from Ukrainian or Russian troops, he added. John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said exposing the troops to modern realities of the war, including with drones, is &quot;definitely&quot; part of Pyongyang&apos;s goals to bolster its military. &#x201C;Overall, it&apos;ll be important to see whether this North Korean contingent is the beginning of the end of the North Korean deployment or if it&apos;s the prelude to a larger and more steady stream of troops,&#x201D; Hardie told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;At this rate, seeing how badly the latest round of Russian offensives went (in November), I think a lot will now depend on how well the North Koreans will perform &#x2013; if they can tip the scales,&#x201D; Paroinen told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;(North Korean troops) certainly change up the game now that they are using different tactics to what the Ukrainians are used to and they will bring the numbers.&#x201D; The Ukrainian official briefed on the intelligence, speaking anonymously, said that there are no signs that Russia would deploy North Korean troops en masse in Ukraine in the near future, as Moscow is focused on reclaiming the entirety of Kursk Oblast. Paroinen from the Black Bird Group estimated that, as of December, Ukraine still controlled less than 500 square kilometers of Kursk Oblast, which is roughly the size of Chicago.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-especially-vulnerable-to-drones-but-gaining-ground-in-kursk-oblast-experts-say/	2024-12-19T10:44:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1074306244.jpg
Zelensky dismisses ceasefire as Putin’s ploy to regroup, seeks coordinated peace plan	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 that American and European participation in possible peace negotiations with Russia is crucial while rejecting the idea of freezing the conflict. Ahead of the anticipated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s focus on ending the war after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Zelensky expressed hope that Europe would be involved in the effort, sharing a strong, united stance. Zelensky warned against granting Moscow a temporary break it seeks through a ceasefire, advocating instead for concerted international pressure to achieve an actual ending of Russia&apos;s war. &#x201C;We need coordinated work for a lasting peace, not just the suspension of hostilities that Putin seeks in order to buy time,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;We cannot live with a frozen conflict. When it comes to ceasefire, people know what comes after. How everything will end. You have to know what tomorrow brings in order to have a ceasefire.&#x201D; Zelensky also highlighted the role of the so-called Global South nations, including China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil, in supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity and influencing Russia. He urged Europe to recognize and leverage these countries&apos; potential to advance peace, noting their alignment with the principles of territorial sovereignty. Reports of Trump&#x2019;s intentions to end the war, potentially by pressuring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia or relinquish its NATO aspirations, have raised concerns among Ukraine supporters and in Kyiv. Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end the war in &#x201C;24 hours,&#x201D; but he has not elaborated on his approach. On Dec. 12, he reiterated his belief that European troops should lead efforts to monitor any potential ceasefire, saying that Europe must assume greater responsibility in countering Russian aggression. The EU, however, does not foresee negotiations or a ceasefire in the near future, according to a high-ranking EU official who spoke to the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-dismisses-ceasefire-as-putins-ploy-to-regroup-seeks-coordinated-peace-plan-zelensky-says/	2024-12-19T10:17:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/0de35cc483afba4f3068809e809b4d53_1734626087_extra_large.jpeg
Denmark allocates $292 million to bolster Ukraine’s air defense, minister says	Denmark has allocated 2.1 billion Danish kroner (over $292 million) to bolster Ukraine&apos;s air defense, Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen announced on Dec. 19. The announcement comes amid intensified Russian attacks against Ukraine, including one of the largest aerial strikes on Dec. 13, which targeted energy infrastructure across Ukraine. The package includes financial support for the operation of Ukraine&#x2019;s F-16 fighter jets used to counter Russian air targets. &#x201C;One of Ukraine&apos;s most urgent needs right now is the ability to protect itself from Russian air strikes. That is why we are prioritizing more support for air defense,&#x201D; Poulsen said. Denmark has already transferred the second batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 7. Denmark has provided Ukraine with about $7.5 billion worth of military aid since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. It was also the first country to offer military aid to Ukraine through direct purchases from Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry. Denmark is part of a broader coalition effort to bolster aid to Ukraine ahead of the uncertain future of U.S. aid under incoming President Donald Trump. On Nov. 27, the heads of government from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, and Sweden reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine. The countries identified Russia as a significant long-term threat and called for stronger sanctions and enhanced defense measures to counter Moscow&#x2019;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-allocates-292-million-to-bolster-ukraines-air-defense/	2024-12-19T09:13:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-914935130.jpg
‘Just thugs’ — Zelensky blasts Putin’s Oreshnik threats, 'high-tech' duel proposal with the West	At a press conference in Brussels on Dec. 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s recent threats of using the new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Kyiv to test Western air defense systems in what he called a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West. Putin proposed the &quot;high-tech duel&quot; during his annual press conference on Dec. 19. He suggested launching an Oreshnik at a site in Kyiv while challenging the West to deploy their air defenses to intercept it, claiming the missile was unbeatable. &quot;Do you think this is an adequate person? They are just thugs,&quot; Zelensky said while commenting on Putin&apos;s threats. Putin&apos;s remarks followed his earlier threats to use Oreshnik missiles to strike at &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv. Russia first launched an Oreshnik at the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. The strike was accompanied by a Russian propaganda campaign claiming the attack was carried out in response to the U.S. and U.K.&apos;s decision to lift restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia and aimed at undermining Western support for Kyiv. Zelensky also commented on the 2022 Istanbul negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and Putin&apos;s peace proposal back then, dismissing them as a sham. &#x201C;He simply offered Ukraine to surrender, freeze the conflict, shift allegiance to Russia, and give up our independence,&#x201D; Zelensky said. &#x201C;This person calls these some kind of agreements. He is just an old fantasist living in his own aquarium.&#x201D; The draft of the Istanbul agreement was published in full by The New York Times in June. According to it, both sides agreed to exclude Ukraine&apos;s Crimea from the treaty, leaving it under Russian occupation without Ukraine recognizing Russian sovereignty over it while the status of other Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine was to be decided in later talks between presidents Zelensky and Putin. Ukraine offered to abandon aspirations to join NATO or any other military alliance, but the treaty allowed Kyiv to enter the EU. Russia also demanded the lifting of all sanctions, repealing Kyiv&apos;s laws related to language and national identity, and limiting Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/just-thugs-zelensky-blasts-putins-oreshnik-threats-high-tech-duel-proposal-with-the-west/	2024-12-19T08:08:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/7e69d910db63590990aa61727350f2a8_1734609326.jpeg
Ukraine's brigade commander arrested over alleged power abuse after media investigation	A court in Ternopil took into custody Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk, the commander of the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade, who is suspected of abuse of power, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported. The court set the bail for Poberezhniuk at Hr 908,400 ($21,600). He was charged with abuse of office after he allegedly had four of his subordinates help build his house in Khmelnytskyi Oblast in the fall of 2023. While performing the service for Poberezhniuk, the four service members received full salaries and combat payments and were officially listed in a working visit to Mykolaiv Oblast. On Dec. 16, Ukrainska Pravda reported that the unit&apos;s officers had beaten service members, extorted money from them, and even tied one soldier to a wooden cross as a punishment. In response to the media investigation, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ordered an inspection and suspended Poberezhniuk. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov also ordered an investigation into the alleged abuse, extortion, and humiliation of soldiers. The 211th Brigade, formed in August 2023, performs engineering work, builds defenses in the rear, and does not participate in direct combat. According to Ukrainska Pravda, the cases of abuse surfaced after the start of official checks in the spring of 2024. The outlet&apos;s sources named now-Captain Vladyslav Pastukh, Poborezhniuk&apos;s godson and the son of the unit&apos;s chief of staff, as one of the main perpetrators. The officer was said to have extorted money from soldiers on account of being related to the unit&apos;s most senior officers. Though Pastukh no longer serves in the unit, the media investigation identified almost a dozen cases of fathers and sons or husbands and wives serving together in the 211th Brigade. The revelations come as Ukraine faces mounting challenges in replenishing the ranks of its Armed Forces, facing low enlistment rates and even cases of desertion. Mykhailo Drapatyi, the new commander of the Ground Forces, recently announced wide-ranging reforms focusing on recruitment and training.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-brigade-commander-arrested-over-alleged-power-abuse-after-journalists-investigation/	2024-12-19T05:53:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1738887156.jpg
Ukraine's economy healthier that Russia's in some indicators, The Economist reports	Ukraine&apos;s economy has adapted well to the realities of the full-scale war while Russia&apos;s economy faces increasingly unfavorable forecasts, The Economist wrote on Dec. 18. Although Ukraine appears to be &quot;winning the economic war against Russia,&quot; the outlet&apos;s analysis suggests that further development will depend on how Kyiv manages incoming challenges like workforce and resource shortages or Donald Trump&apos;s presidency. Russia&apos;s invasion caused a major hit to Ukraine&apos;s economy, which suffered a whopping 29.1% fall in GDP in 2022. Since then, the country has made strides in stabilizing the situation, and the GDP is expected to grow by over 4% in 2024 and 2025. In comparison, Russia faces surging inflation and a falling ruble that forced the central bank to institute a 21% interest rate, the highest level since the early 2000s. Ukraine&apos;s central bank also recently raised the interest rate but only to 13.5%. Russia&apos;s expected economic growth is also slowing down, forecasted to grow by 0.5-1.5% next year. The Economist attributed Ukraine&apos;s positive development to the joint efforts of local businesses, the state, and international partners. Ukrainian enterprises have successfully adapted to operating under energy restrictions caused by Russian strikes. Ukraine resumed shipping in the Black Sea despite an attempted Russian blockade, and international support has helped the country&apos;s budget stay afloat. As the full-scale war nears its third anniversary, Ukraine faces &quot;its biggest threats yet&quot; in the shape of labor shortages, energy deficits, and increasingly tight finances, The Economist wrote. The Group of Seven (G7) countries agreed in 2024 to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan backed by proceeds from frozen Russian assets to fund the state&apos;s operations and defense needs. The prospect of further aid nevertheless remains increasingly uncertain amid political instability in major European countries and the incoming Trump administration. The U.S. president-elect has shown little appetite for prolonged support for Ukraine, vowing to bring both sides to the negotiating table and quickly end the war. Kyiv&apos;s problems are multiplied by unfavorable developments on the front. Russia currently holds the upper hand on the battlefield, advancing at a rapid pace in Donetsk Oblast while Ukraine struggles to replenish its ranks to hold back more numerous Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-economy-healthier-that-russias-in-some-indicators-the-economist-reports/	2024-12-19T05:52:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1420136216.jpg
Putin claims Russia wasn't 'defeated' in Syria	Moscow achieved its goals in Syria, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed during his annual press conference and a call-in program on Dec. 19. following the collapse of dictator Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime. Commenting on the fall of Assad&apos;s regime for the first time, Putin said Russia invaded Syria to prevent the creation of &quot;a terrorist enclave.&quot; &quot;All that is happening in Syria is not a defeat for Russia,&quot; he added. Russia has been Assad&apos;s key supporter, deploying troops in the country since 2015 to back the dictator in the civil war and losing at least hundreds of soldiers in the process. Syrian rebels announced on Dec. 8 that they successfully ousted Assad following a lightning offensive across the country, which culminated with the capture of the capital city of Damascus. Moscow persuaded Assad to flee to Russia with his family after realizing his regime was bound to lose to the opposition&apos;s rapid advance, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 11, citing its sources. The Russian president said at the press conference that he had not met with Assad since he arrived in Moscow. Putin also claimed that most Syrian factions would welcome the continued presence of Russian military bases in the country but said Moscow must first assess its future relationship with them. &quot;We maintain relations with all the groups that control the situation there... The vast majority of them tell us that they would be interested in our military bases remaining in Syria,&quot; Putin claimed. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know. We have to think about this because we must assess our relations with those political forces that are in control and will be in control of the situation in the future.&quot; Putin&apos;s statements contrast with multiple reports indicating Russian forces are preparing to withdraw from their bases in the Middle Eastern country.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-claims-russia-achieved-its-goals-in-syria/	2024-12-19T05:39:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-959602072-1.jpg
Zelensky meets top EU officials in Brussels, discusses 'just peace' approach	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with the new president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a two-day summit in Brussels on Dec. 19. Zelensky and Costa discussed how to support Ukraine and the importance of Western efforts to achieve a &quot;just peace.&quot; &quot;As we approach the start of the new year, we really need unity between the United States, the EU, and European countries,&quot; Zelensky said alongside Costa. &quot;Only together, the U.S. and Europe can truly stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and save Ukraine.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky and European Council President Antonio Costa during a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 19, 2024. (Volodymyr Zelensky/X)Among other topics, the officials discussed protecting Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure from Russian aerial attacks and increasing domestic defense production. Separately, Zelensky and von der Leyen also discussed Kyiv&apos;s accession to the EU and the use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine&apos;s needs. Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it will provide $20 billion in loan assistance to Ukraine, marking its contribution to a broader $50 billion initiative supported by G7 countries. Ukraine is expected to receive 18.1 billion euros ($18.8 billion) in macro-financial aid from the EU as part of the G7 loan. The first tranche will be disbursed in January 2025, Zelensky added.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-meets-top-eu-officials-in-brussels/	2024-12-19T04:36:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GfKP2FIXkAAs7-f.jpg
Shooting reported in Russian-occupied Abkhazia's local council; council member killed	A shooting in the &quot;people assembly&quot; building of Georgia&apos;s Russian-occupied region of Abkhazia left one person dead and another injured, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Dec. 19. Vakhtang Golandzia, a member of the assembly that de facto serves as the occupied region&apos;s legislative body, was fatally shot, and his colleague Kan Kvarchia was injured, RFE/RL reported, citing local health authorities. The suspected perpetrator, council member Adgur Kharazia, fled the crime scene, the Apsynpress news agency reported. Kvarchia has been hospitalized with a wound to his arm, according to local officials. The Amra-life Telegram channel alleged that the council was discussing a bill on a mining ban. During the deliberations, Kharazia and Kvarchia got into an argument, after which Kharazia pulled out a gun and opened fire at Kvarchia, the channel wrote. Golandzia was shot after supposedly attempting to intervene. Russia has occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia after a war with Tbilisi in 2008, backing local breakaway leadership. Both regions are internationally recognized as Georgia&apos;s sovereign soil.	https://kyivindependent.com/shooting-reported-in-abkhazia-local-council/	2024-12-19T04:17:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2173673388.jpg
Ukraine's parliament passes bill dissolving medical commissions after corruption scandals	The Ukrainian parliament on Dec. 19 adopted a bill dissolving the system of medical examination commissions (MSEC) for determining the severity of disabilities. President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree in October to disband the commissions after several officials were accused of using corrupt schemes to acquire falsified disability certifications. A total of 259 members of parliament voted in favor of the bill, said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of the opposition Holos party. Obtaining disability status through medical examination commissions allows one to avoid military service and receive a higher pension, among other social benefits. Starting Jan. 1, Ukraine will introduce new expert commissions in major hospitals for assessing people&apos;s medical status based on a new, &quot;modern system,&quot; Zhelezniak said. &quot;The system of medical and social expertise that currently exists in Ukraine was formed before Ukraine gained independence. It does not meet the current challenges that our country faces during the armed aggression by the Russian Federation, nor the current approaches to establishing disability adopted in the world,&quot; the explanatory note to the draft law read. The bill&apos;s authors expect that the new system will help create a transparent procedure for assessing the needs of the applicants. The replacement of commissions is expected to reduce the administrative burden and help reduce appeals against their decisions. The draft law has to be signed by the president before becoming law. Following the National Security and Defense Council meeting on Oct. 22, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that the SBU had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions in 2024, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions have been charged with committing crimes, while another nine suspects have been convicted. According to Zelensky&apos;s October decree, all commissions in Ukraine will be eliminated by Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following the reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-passes-bill-dissolving-medical-commissions-after-corruption-scandals/	2024-12-19T03:36:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Russia building ring road around Azov Sea in occupied parts of Ukraine, Putin says	Russia is planning to build a ring road around the Azov Sea, passing through the occupied territories of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference and a call-in program on Dec. 19. The road is expected to run through Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast, the occupied Ukrainian towns of Mariupol, Melitopol, and Henichesk in the country&apos;s east and south, and through Dzhankoi in occupied Crimea. Moscow has already built a 40-kilometer-long (25 miles) segment between the Russian city of Taganrog and Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast, according to Putin. &quot;We plan to bring the roads to Russian standards within three years,&quot; he said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Russia is also illegally constructing a railroad between Russia&apos;s city Rostov-on-Don and Crimea, which would run via occupied Donetsk, Mariupol, and Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The railroad will likely serve as an alternative to the Kerch Bridge, which connects the Russian mainland with the Crimean Peninsula and became a critical supply route for Moscow&apos;s forces after the launch of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said the Russian railway could pose &quot;a serious problem&quot; and is &quot;an important target&quot; for Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-building-ring-road-around-azov-sea-putin-says/	2024-12-19T03:26:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1245201349.jpg
Putin proposes to 'experiment' on Western air defenses by launching Oreshnik at Kyiv	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 19 mockingly suggested a &quot;high-tech duel&quot; with the West by launching the Oreshnik missile against Kyiv to prove Western air defenses cannot intercept it. Speaking during his annual press conference and a call-in program, Putin again claimed that Russia&apos;s &quot;new&quot; Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) cannot be intercepted by air defenses. &quot;And those Western experts who think (the Oreshnik can be intercepted), let them suggest to us and those in the West who pay them to conduct a technological experiment,&quot; Putin said. &quot;Let&apos;s call it a high-tech duel of the 21st century. Let them determine some site to hit, let&apos;s say, in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defenses there, and we will strike there with the Oreshnik and see what happens.&quot; Russia launched an Oreshnik missile against Dnipro in Ukraine on Nov. 21, supposedly as a response to the U.S. and the U.K. lifting restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes inside Russia. The Oreshnik strike was followed by a propaganda blitz reportedly aimed at scaring off the Western support for Kyiv. Despite Putin&apos;s claims, Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that there already are air defense systems that can successfully take down the missile The U.S. operates the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), designed to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system has not been supplied to Ukraine and, therefore, has never been tested against the Oreshnik. Speaking at the press conference, the Russian president said that U.S. air defense systems are &quot;costly and ineffective&quot; and said he sees &quot;no problem&quot; if Washington supplies THAAD to Ukraine. Putin also insisted that the Oreshnik missile, which he said has a range of 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), is a completely new weapon. Experts disputed this statement, saying that the weapon is based on the existing RS-26 Rubezh system. The Kremlin&apos;s chief previously threatened to strike Kyiv&apos;s &quot;decision-making centers&quot; with the Oreshnik and said Russia would begin mass-producing the weapon. Undisclosed Russian officials told The Moscow Times that mass production is unlikely due to Russia&apos;s technological shortcomings.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-on-oreshnik-kyiv/	2024-12-19T03:03:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189232547.jpg
US reimposes sanctions on entities involved in Nord Stream 2 construction	The U.S. reimposed sanctions against a number of entities involved in the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, the U.S. State Department announced on Dec. 18. Washington imposed sanctions on entities previously sanctioned under the Protecting Europe&#x2019;s Energy Security Act (PEESA) for their involvement in the pipeline&apos;s construction, as well as several new owners of vessels previously blocked under PEESA. The Nord Stream 2 was meant to funnel Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea. Berlin has been heavily criticized by Ukraine, the U.S., and other partners for the project, which they said would deepen Germany&apos;s energy dependence on Russia. The U.S. sanctions list includes 11 Russian companies, including Nord Stream 2 AG, the project operator that provided insurance to the project&apos;s companies, and Matthias Warnig, the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to continue to work and ensure that Russia is never able to weaponize its energy resources and its energy positioning for political gain again,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters on Dec. 18. The construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was almost completed when Russia began concentrating its forces near Ukraine&apos;s border in late 2021 and early 2022 Ukraine for the full-scale invasion. In September 2022, the Nord Stream 1 and 2 underwater pipelines connecting Russia to Germany were blown up under unclear circumstances. Investigations have been ongoing since then but have yet to produce a definitive conclusion regarding the cause of the explosions. Moscow and the West have traded blame for the incident. German investigators reportedly issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian national, believed to be part of the group that blew up the pipeline, the German media reported in August. Kyiv has denied any involvement.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-reimposes-sanctions-on-entities-involved-in-nord-stream-2-construction/	2024-12-19T02:32:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/2021-12-thumbnail-image-882jpeg960x0-q90-crop-upscale.jpg
Putin acknowledges sanctions have impact on Russia's economy	International sanctions are affecting growing prices in Russia, but there are also shortcomings by Russian authorities, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference on Dec. 19, state news agency TASS reported. Russian officials have largely dismissed the importance of Western sanctions imposed over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, boasting about a strong and resilient economy. While independent observers mostly agreed that the sanctions fell short of the desired effect, there are mounting warning signs regarding Russia&apos;s economy ahead of 2025. &quot;The sanctions are having an effect, but they are not of key importance,&quot; Putin said when talking about the surging inflation and prices in Russia. The country&apos;s annual inflation rate rose 9.2-9.3% while the ruble oscillates around 100 to the U.S. dollar. Russia&apos;s central bank sought to curb inflation by instituting the highest interest rates &#x2013; 21% &#x2013; since the early 2000s. According to Putin, inflation is driven by the supply not keeping up with the demand and the rising prices of some products globally. Many experts also connected the development to increased defense spending as Russia invests record sums in its full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;Some experts believe that the central bank could have used tools unrelated to raising the key interest rate more effectively and earlier,&quot; Putin said. &quot;The central bank began doing this in the summer, but these experts believe this could and should have been done earlier.&quot; The combined effect of sanctions and inflation is beginning to threaten the Russian economy in various sectors, including automotive, aviation, and retail. This development comes amid a growing push by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to launch negotiations in Ukraine as soon as possible, though Moscow has shown little interest in peace talks.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-acknowledges-sanctions-have-impact-on-russias-economy/	2024-12-19T02:07:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1246324907.jpg
Ukraine won't limit army's strength as part of potential peace talks, Zelensky says	Ukraine will not agree to reduce its Armed Forces even if Kyiv receives an invitation to join NATO, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists in Brussels overnight on Dec. 19, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. &quot;Demilitarization&quot; was one of the insincere excuses that Russian President Vladimir Putin used to justify a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow demanded Ukraine to reduce its army to 50,000 people, five times fewer than the country had by 2022, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) investigation project Sistema reported in November, citing an obtained first draft of Moscow&apos;s peace offer to Kyiv. According to Zelensky, Western guarantees to provide Kyiv with military and financial aid are not enough to guarantee that Putin will not attack Kyiv again. &quot;Therefore, the best thing is a strong army, a large army, the largest army in Europe. We simply have no right to limit the strength of our army in any case,&quot; the president said. Kyiv&apos;s membership in NATO would be the best security guarantee, Zelensky reiterated during a briefing after meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Brussels on Dec. 19. &quot;We do not expect (an invitation to NATO) from anyone, (but) we are fighting for this right,&quot; he added. Zelensky also told journalists that Ukraine will make every effort to be strong enough in 2025 to end the war through diplomacy. Earlier, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said that Kyiv is not prepared to enter negotiations with Russia as it lacks sufficient Western support to engage from a position of strength. &quot;We will do everything so that next year we can be strong and move on to diplomacy,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;I don&apos;t believe that Putin wants the war to end, so we will figure it out. In any case, on our part, we are doing everything to end this war fairly for us, for Ukraine.&quot; Ukraine has shifted its rhetoric amid growing expectations of possible ceasefire talks as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he aims to push Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-wont-limit-its-army-zelensky-says/	2024-12-19T01:32:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Ukraine strikes 'only oil refinery operating' in Russia's Rostov Oblast, military says	Ukraine&apos;s Navy and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) carried out a combined strike against the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Dec. 19, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Russian authorities and Telegram channels reported explosions and fire at the facility earlier the same day, connecting it to a Ukrainian drone attack. The Novoshakhtinsk facility is &quot;the only oil refinery operating&quot; in the region, the General Staff said. It reportedly produces up to 7.5 million tons of oil products annually and specializes in fuel production. The city of Novoshakhtinsk lies around 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Russo-Ukrainian border and over 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the front line. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show the aftermath of a Ukrainian strike against the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery, Rostov Oblast, Russia, overnight on Dec. 19, 2024. (SBU source)Initially, SBU drones attacked the facility to distract Russian air defenses, providing a &quot;window&quot; for Ukrainian-made missiles to strike the facility, an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. The strike resulted in a massive fire and caused significant damage, the source claimed. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said the fire had been extinguished as of 6:45 a.m. local time. One person was reportedly injured in the region due to falling drone debris. The fire also affected the refinery&apos;s ELOU-AVT-2.5 catalytic cracking unit, according to the General Staff. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify all the claims. Ukraine has previously targeted the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery with drone strikes. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces claimed that a July attack on the refinery destroyed &#xA0;1.5 million tons of oil and oil products worth $540 million. The refinery partially shut down after an attack in March. Ukrainian forces regularly target Russian oil depots in addition to attacks on weapons factories and military airfields. Fossil fuel exports are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-only-oil-refinery-operating-in-russias-rostov-oblast-military-says/	2024-12-19T00:52:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Picture2-1.png
At least 100 North Korean soldiers killed, 1,000 wounded in Russia-Ukraine war, South Korean official says	At least 100 North Korean troops have been killed while fighting for Russia against Ukraine, a South Korean lawmaker said after an intelligence briefing, the BBC reported on Dec. 19. Another 1,000 of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers have been injured, South Korean MP Lee Sung-kwon told reporters, connecting the high casualty rates to the lack of experience with terrain and drone warfare. The comments come after an undisclosed U.S. official estimated for the media that &quot;a couple of hundred&quot; of North Korean troops have been injured or killed since joining combat earlier this month. &#xA0; Pyongyang has dispatched over 10,000 of its soldiers to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast since early August, Kyiv and Western officials said. &quot;Within the Russian military, complaints have reportedly surfaced that the North Korean troops, due to their lack of knowledge about drones, are more of a burden than an asset,&quot; Lee Sung-kwon said in comments quoted by the BBC. After reporting initial but limited clashes with North Korean troops in the fall, Ukraine said that in December, Russia also began using the soldiers in ground assaults. The full extent of North Korean losses might be hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean personnel had engaged in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and suffered their first losses.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-100-north-korean-soldiers-killed-seoul-says/	2024-12-19T00:23:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2057474423.jpg
Russia fails to breach Ukraine's defense lines in simultaneous attacks, Syrskyi says	Russian troops have intensified attacks in several areas along the front line over the past few days, but failed to break through Ukraine&apos;s defense lines, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 19. Syrskyi described the battlefield situation as &quot;extremely difficult.&quot; His statement comes as Russia keeps on advancing in Donetsk Oblast in an attempt to occupy the key towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff has recorded a total of 250 front-line clashes over the past day. &quot;In the heavy battles, Ukrainian defense forces did not allow Russian forces to breach the defense and achieve operational success in any direction,&quot; Syrskyi said following a phone call with Admiral Tony Radakin, the head of the U.K.&apos;s Armed Forces. Syrskyi said that, according to Radakin, London will &quot;significantly increase&quot; certain aspects of its support for Ukraine in 2025. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line. Apart from Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine expects Russian forces to launch larger-scale attacks in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Syrskyi said on Dec. 17 that Russian forces were also carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast, deploying North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in the Russian region since early AUgust.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-fails-to-breach-ukraines-defenses-syrskyi-says/	2024-12-19T00:13:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/photo_2024-02-08-22_12_44.jpeg
Russian attacks kill 1, injure 8 in Ukraine over past day	Russian attacks across Ukrainian regions killed at least one civilian and injured at least eight other people over the past day, regional authorities reported on Dec. 19. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 45 of the 85 Shahed-type drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

Trump's peace envoy nominee to visit Ukraine in early January, Zelensky confirms	Keith Kellogg, nominated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump as Ukraine peace envoy, will visit Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration in January, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed to journalists in Brussels overnight on Dec. 19, according to a Kyiv Independent reporter. A day earlier, Reuters reported that Kellogg is planning to visit Kyiv and several European capitals before Trump takes office on Jan. 20 as part of the new administration&#x2019;s effort to address Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Two unnamed sources told Reuters that Kellogg does not intend to travel to Moscow during this trip. &quot;(The visit to Ukraine) will take place in early January. We are waiting for Mr. Kellogg, and then we will talk about what he had meant,&quot; Zelensky said. The president referred to Kellogg&apos;s latest remarks about potential Ukraine-Russia peace talks. &quot;I think both sides are ready,&quot; the incoming envoy told Fox News on Dec. 18. Trump has pledged to quickly bring an end to the war but has not provided details on how he plans to do it. At his first news conference since winning the election, Trump voiced his intention to make &quot;a little progress&quot; toward peace. Zelensky recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-peace-envoy-nominee-to-visit-ukraine-in-early-january-zelensky-confirms/	2024-12-18T23:06:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
North Korea producing missiles for Russia's use in Ukraine within months, researcher tells UN	North Korea is producing ballistic missiles for use by Russia against Ukraine faster than previously thought, Jonah Leff, the executive director at the independent Conflict Armament Research (CAR) group, told the U.N. Security Council on Dec. 18. Leff said that the researchers from his group examined remnants of four North Korean missiles recovered in Ukraine in July and August. One of them had marks showing it was procured in 2024, according to the researcher. &quot;This is the first public evidence of missiles having been produced in North Korea and then used in Ukraine within a matter of months, not years,&quot; Leff said. North Korea has shaped up to be Russia&apos;s leading supporter in its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing not only ballistic missiles and artillery ammunition but also soldiers. Leff told the U.N. Security Council back in June that his group has &quot;irrefutably&quot; established that Russia is using North Korean missiles against Ukraine. According to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, Russian forces have launched at least 60 North Korean ballistic missiles, namely the short-range KN-23/24 model, as of early December. &quot;Their accuracy, in principle, is not very high. We understand that the technology with which they were manufactured is outdated,&quot; Andrii Cherniak, a military intelligence spokesperson, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Leff also said that some of the components found in the missile debris did not originate in North Korea and were produced as early as 2023. &quot;Despite nearly two decades of sanctions on the DPRK, it has demonstrated this year its ability to produce and supply ballistic missiles for use against Ukraine within just a matter of months,&quot; the researcher commented. The DPRK is the official name of North Korea. &quot;Through CAR&apos;s collaborative approach with industry, we have ascertained that these components found in remnants of weapons systems used against Ukraine derived from supplies by third-party distributors, mostly based in East Asia.&quot; Russia has not officially confirmed weapons shipments from North Korea but affirmed a close military and economic relationship with Pyongyang. Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a strategic partnership pact in July, and North Korea has subsequently dispatched over 10,000 soldiers to aid Russian forces in the embattled Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-producing-missiles-for-russia/	2024-12-18T22:50:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166581524.jpg

Russian hockey player sentenced to prison in Poland for spying	Russian professional ice hockey player Maxim Sergeyev was convicted by a Polish court on Dec. 16 on charges of espionage and sentenced to nearly three years in prison. Sergeyev, who previously played on the OKS Zagliebie Sosnowiec professional ice hockey team in the second division of Poland&apos;s junior league, was arrested in June 2023, the Russian independent media outlet Meduza reported. Authorities said that Sergeyev, 21, spied on and took photos of Polish and NATO military sites, including a military equipment factory. After being recruited by a Russian intelligence official on Telegram, Sergeyev also posted pro-Russian &quot;political content&quot; on social media, writing, among other things, that the war in Ukraine &quot;does not concern Poles.&quot; Sergeyev received a small payment for the content through cryptocurrency transfers. Prosecutors also said that Sergeyev later joined a 16-person Russian cell with the intention of sabotaging a train carrying weapons and humanitarian aid to Ukraine in exchange for 10,000 euros ($10,380). Sergeyev plead guilty to the charges, and will be deported back to Russia in May 2025 once his 2 year and 11 month sentence, which he is currently serving in Lublin, is up. Several European countries have in recent months reported numerous cases of espionage and sabotage suspected of being carried out on the behest of Russia.&#x200B;&#x200B; Alleged Russian spy rings have been discovered in countries including Ukraine, the U.K., and Slovenia. Separately, it was revealed in May that Russia is recruiting violent right-wing extremists to carry out sabotage attacks in Europe and the U.K., raising concerns among intelligence chiefs.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hockey-player-sentenced-to-prison-for-spying-in-poland/	2024-12-18T21:32:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2058422331.jpg
UK announces $283 million military aid package for Ukraine	Following his visit to Kyiv, U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey announced a 225 million pound ($283 million) military aid package for Ukraine on Dec. 19. According to media reports, the package includes over 92 million pound ($115 million) in equipment to support Ukraine&apos;s navy, including small boats, as well as reconnaissance drones. A further 68 million pounds ($85 million) will be used to supply over 1,000 counter-drone electronic warfare systems. Munitions, spare parts, and equipment will also be included in the package. The latest aid package comes as Healey made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Dec. 18 to meet with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, in a show of solidarity for the embattled country. &quot;The brave people of Ukraine continue to defy all expectations with their unbreakable spirit... but they cannot go it alone &#x2013; which is why the UK will step up our international leadership on Ukraine throughout 2025,&quot; Healey said in a statement. The delivery of counter-drone electronic warfare systems comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky has been calling on Western allies to provide additional air defense systems as Russia continues it onslaught of aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities. During a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Brussels on Dec. 18, Zelensky called on NATO allies to provide more air defense. The president later announced during a press briefing with reporters that the country needs 19 air defense systems to protect critical infrastructure across the country, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist present at the briefing. The U.K.&apos;s announcement on Dec. 19 comes amid news that the U.S. may run out of time to deliver the remaining $5.6 billion in military aid allocated to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-announces-283-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-12-18T20:26:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/gettyimages-2189965534-612x612.jpg

Explosions reported at Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia's Rostov Oblast	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Explosions occurred at the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast in the early hours of Dec. 19, Russian media reported. A fire broke out at the facility after a mass drone attack, the Russian Telegram news channel Astra reported, citing eyewitnesses. The outlet also posted video footage of the site in flames. Officials have not commented on the alleged attack. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm the report at the time of publication. Shortly before reports began circulating of the strike on the Novoshakhtinsk refinery, acting Rostov Oblast Governor Yury Slyusar claimed that Russian air defenses shot down seven drones over the region. The reported attack comes on the heels of an alleged strike on the Kamensky Combine, another Russian industrial facility in Rostov Oblast. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, said the site was attacked on Dec. 18. The Kamensky Combine is one of the largest chemical plants in Russia. The facility produces rocket fuel, including fuel for intercontinental ballistic missiles, Kovalenko said. Ukraine has previously targeted the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery with drone strikes. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces claimed that a July attack on the refinery destroyed &#xA0;1.5 million tons of oil and oil products worth $540 million.

Following their meeting on Dec. 18, Zelensky said that Macron discussed the communications he has had &quot;with other partners to implement all necessary steps to achieve peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-macron-discuss-possibility-of-peacekeeping-force-in-ukraine/	2024-12-18T15:20:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/macronzel.jpeg
World Bank approves over $2 billion in funds for Ukraine	The World Bank&apos;s Board of Directors on Dec. 18 approved $2.05 billion in Development Policy Operation (DPO) grants to Ukraine, part of which is funded by a portion of the new U.S. $20 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets. The funding supports the Ukrainian government in implementing reforms that will strengthen and stabilize the economy, the World Bank said in press release. The DPO funds are co-financed by two sources: $1 billion from the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine Financial Intermediary Fund (F.O.R.T.I.S. Ukraine FIF) and $1.05 billion from the Advancing Needed Credit Enhancement (ADVANCE) Ukraine Trust Fund, supported by the U.K. and Japan. The $1 billion grant via the intermediary fund represents the first payment Ukraine will receive from the Group of Seven (G7) plan to issue $50 billion in financing to Kyiv backed by frozen Russian assets. The U.S., which is contributing a loan worth $20 billion to the G7 effort, transferred its portion to the World Bank&apos;s intermediary fund on Dec. 10. &quot;Despite significant challenges, the Government of Ukraine has stabilized the economy and remains focused on its development goals, particularly its ambition to join the European Union,&quot; Bob Saum, World Bank Regional Country Director for Eastern Europe, said on Dec. 18. &quot;There have been significant achievements, and Ukraine continues to advance in its efforts to implement reforms to establish a vibrant market economy. The World Bank Group and our international partners will continue to support the Ukrainian people in realizing their EU aspirations.&quot; The DPO funds will focus on Ukraine&apos;s growth potential, supporting the railway sector, banking, and renewable energy generation, the World Bank said. Funding will also support efforts to increase domestic revenues.	https://kyivindependent.com/world-bank-approves-over-2-billion-in-funds-for-ukraine/	2024-12-18T14:31:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2171755120.jpg
One of Russia's largest chemical plants reportedly attacked in Rostov Oblast	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being edited. The Kamensky Combine, one of the largest chemical plants in Russia, was hit in an attack on Rostov Oblast, Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center, claimed on Dec. 18. The factory produces rocket fuel and components of ammunition and explosives, Kovalenko said. Russian officials have not commented on the alleged strike on the Kamensky Combine. Rostov Oblast Acting Governor Yury Slyusar claimed that Russian air defense forces shot down 10 missiles over the region on Dec. 18. Kovalenko posted a video on his official Telegram channel purporting to show explosions at the plant. The Kamensky Combine &quot;is engaged in the production of rocket fuel (specializing in the manufacture of solid fuel components for rocket engines, in particular for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and intercontinental ballistic missiles using solid fuel),&quot; Kovalenko said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims at time of publication. The Kamensky Combine has been sanctioned by the E.U., U.K., and U.S. for its role in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The reported strike comes a week after Ukraine allegedly struck a boiler plant in Rostov Oblast in an overnight missile attack on Dec. 11. Kyiv continues to target military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, and oil refineries in Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/one-of-russias-largest-chemical-plants-reportedly-hit-in-attack-on-rostov-oblast/	2024-12-18T13:35:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/rostov.png
25% of Russian malls may face bankruptcy in 2025	Approximately one quarter of Russia&apos;s shopping centers face pre-bankruptcy conditions and risk closure by 2025, according to reports from industry leaders published by Russian media on Dec. 18. The forecast comes as Russia faces record-breaking interest and inflation rates amid an ongoing economic crisis. Representatives from the Russian Council of Shopping Centers (RCSC) said that about 25% of Russia&apos;s malls are at risk of closure in the coming year. &#xA0;The challenges stem from a combination of factors, including the departure of major foreign companies after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, rising operational costs, and increased competition from online marketplaces. A significant rise in interest rates on commercial loans, driven by the Central Bank&apos;s policies, has exacerbated financial difficulties. Oleg Voytsekhovsky, managing director of the RCSC, said that many shopping centers are unable to refinance existing loans or secure new financing. This has hampered profitability and the ability to maintain and modernize facilities. Pavel Lyulin, RCSC&apos;s vice president, pointed to a sharp increase in property values, leading to higher tax burden on shopping centers. In some cases, taxes have increased by as much as tenfold over the past two years. Lyulin estimated that about half of the income from malls is now consumed by taxes, with additional increases expected in 2025. Russia&apos;s Central Bank raised the interest rate from 19% to 21% in October to curb inflation amid economic strains caused by the war in Ukraine. Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said on Dec. 4 that further rate hikes are under consideration. After the launch of the full-scale invasion, Russia saw an exodus of Western companies reluctant to contribute to the country&apos;s economy and war effort. The combined total of losses for foreign companies that exited Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has exceeded $107 billion, Reuters reported on March 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/quarter-of-russian-malls-may-face-bankruptcy-by-2025-report-warns/	2024-12-18T12:51:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1251631736.jpg
Ukraine war latest: 'Couple hundred' North Korean troops lost fighting for Russia against Ukraine, AP reports	Key developments on Dec. 18: A couple hundred North Korean troops have been killed or wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast against Ukraine, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 17, citing a senior U.S. military official. The official did not give an exact figure but said the high casualty rate was in part due to the soldiers&apos; lack of battle experience. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. Despite the losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17 that Russian and North Korean forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row. &quot;For the third day, Russian forces have been conducting intensive offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, actively using North Korean units,&quot; Syrskyi said in an online address to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities held in Lviv, according to Interfax-Ukraine. Citing Ukrainian soldiers, The Economist wrote that Ukraine likely lost around half of the territory it had captured in the initial phase of the operation in August and September. An officer talking to the outlet connected this development to the redeployment of elite units that first spearheaded the offensive. Ukraine likely seeks to hold on to a piece of Russian territory as a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations. Sweden does not exclude the possibility of expanding its physical presence in Ukraine to strengthen the country&apos;s defenses, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent published on Dec. 18. In response to a question over whether Sweden would potentially take part in a more direct physical presence in Ukraine amid talks of potentially deploying peacekeepers to monitor a possible ceasefire, Jonson said he doesn&apos;t &quot;exclude that possibility.&quot; The minister noted that Sweden already has a physical presence in Ukraine through its defense procurement agency that works with the Ukrainian government to purchase military equipment. Jonson also said Sweden does not rule out the possibility of conducting military training inside Ukraine. As of October, Sweden&apos;s military support to Ukraine has amounted to around $4.4 billion since the start of the full-scale invasion. Jonson stressed the necessity of bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses against Russian aggression and said he supports extending the mandate of the EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), which coordinates military support for Kyiv. He called for urgent measures to secure peace in Ukraine by 2025, describing the situation as &#x201C;absolutely dire and extremely important.&#x201D; &#x201C;The stakes in this war are enormous for the Ukrainian people, but also for the rest of Europe,&#x201D; he said. Russian security forces have detained two suspects over the assassination of a top Kremlin general and his assistant in Moscow, Russian media reported on Dec. 18. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov was killed in Moscow on Dec. 17, with a bomb attached to a scooter. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Kommersant and several other Russian outlets cited by the independent news website Meduza, the two suspects carried out the killings on the orders of the SBU. They were detained by police who saw surveillance cameras&#x2019; footage from the scene which recorded a pair of suspicious cars. Russian Telegram channel 112 said the suspects had already confessed to authorities. Russian officials have not yet announced the conclusion of the investigation. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Kirillov, 54, was the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops (RKhBZ). A day before his assassination, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. Moscow&apos;s forces have been increasingly deploying gas attacks against Ukrainian troops, the Kyiv Independent reported in August, and Kirillov has since been sanctioned by the U.K. and Canada for his role in their use. &quot;Kirillov was a war criminal and a completely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 17. &quot;Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.&quot; Peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow will only be possible when Russia has run out of resources to fight its full-scale war, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Dec. 17. &quot;I would like to emphasize once again that only the strong are helped, so we must remain strong,&quot; he told the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Lviv, in comments reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). &quot;Real negotiations for a lasting peace will begin only when the enemy no longer has the resources to continue the war,&quot; he added. With no military plan in sight to retake lost territories, pressure is mounting on Kyiv to enter into peace negotiations with Russia. Yermak warned that any concessions to Russia would only allow it to replenish its army and launch a new offensive in the future. &quot;If Russia is not forced to make a just peace, there will be no peace. There will be a pause and Moscow will use this pause to restore forces and continue the offensive,&quot; Yermak said. During the same event, President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for negotiating with Moscow about peace over Ukraine&#x2019;s head &quot;without leverage.&quot; Orban flew to Moscow in July during a so-called &quot;peace mission&quot; and phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. &quot;How will he put pressure on Putin? With a joke, a smile? Let him keep it,&quot; Zelensky said. Slovak President Peter Pellegrini, also argued in December that achieving peace in Ukraine would likely require accepting partial territorial losses and called for the immediate start of peace negotiations. However, some of Ukraine&#x2019;s European allies rejected such ideas, with Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski earlier this month arguing that Western nations should push Russia, not Ukraine, into peace negotiations to stop the war. The U.S. may run out of time to deliver the remaining $5.6 billion in military aid allocated to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office next month, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 17. &quot;We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,&quot; a U.S. official told the NYT. &quot;But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use,&quot; they added. Although the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden plans to allocate some funds from the presidential drawdown authority, it is unlikely to spend the whole amount. The presidential drawdown authority is a scheme that allows any U.S. President to transfer weapons from the Pentagon&#x2019;s own stockpile instead of ordering them from manufacturers which would take precious time. The U.S. gave more than $60 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine during the Biden administration. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. There are concerns that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its military support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russia&#x2019;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-couple-hundred-north-korean-troops-lost-fighting-for-russia-against-ukraine/	2024-12-18T12:44:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
Russian bombers detected in Alaskan air defense zone	The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) reported on Dec. 18 that it had detected and tracked four Russian military aircraft operating within the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ as a designated stretch of international airspace that necessitates the identification of all aircraft for national security purposes. NORAD reported that the Russian planes remained in international airspace and did not breach U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace. Such events occur &quot;regularly,&quot; the agency said. Russia&apos;s state-owned TASS news agency confirmed the presence of Tu-95MS bombers near Alaska, saying that the flight was part of a planned operation. These aircraft are the same type as those Russia uses to carry out large-scale missile strikes on Ukraine. A number of similar incidents occurred earlier this year. U.S. and Canadian fighter jets on July 25 intercepted Russian and Chinese military aircraft in the ADIZ. NORAD also reported tracking four Russian warplanes in the zone in mid-August. The incidents underscore ongoing tensions surrounding the strategically significant Arctic region, where both Russia and NATO members continue to assert their presence.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-bombers-approach-alaskas-air-defense-zone-norad-says/	2024-12-18T12:19:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240508647.jpg
‘Not a good idea’ — Trump's peace envoy nominee criticizes Russian general assassination	U.S. General Keith Kellogg, nominated as Ukraine peace envoy by President-elect Donald Trump, criticized the recent assassination of Russian Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov during an interview with Fox News on Dec. 18. Kirillov and his assistant were reportedly killed on Dec. 17 in Moscow by a bomb attached to a scooter. Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) claimed responsibility, calling him a &#x201C;war criminal&#x201D; who allegedly ordered the use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops. Kellogg said the incident was a potential violation of the rules of warfare, however, emphasizing that it does not obstruct possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg acknowledged that Kirillov&apos;s targeting could be seen as legitimate, given the accusations against him. However, he cautioned that killing military officers in their hometowns may &quot;escalate tensions.&quot; &quot;When you kill admirals or generals in their hometown, it&apos;s kind of like you&apos;re extending it. And I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a smart thing to do,&quot; Kellogg said. He added that the alleged use of a mercenary in Kirillov&#x2019;s assassination was &quot;not a good idea at all.&quot; Russian security forces have detained two suspects over the assassination of a top Kremlin general and his assistant in Moscow. Two sources cited by Russian media outlet RBC indicated that investigators consider Ukrainian involvement the most plausible scenario.	https://kyivindependent.com/not-a-good-idea-trump-peace-envoy-criticizes-russian-lieutenant-assassination/	2024-12-18T12:06:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1242112038.jpg
Kursk operation prompted Russia's first POW exchange initiative, ombudsman says	Amid Ukraine&apos;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, Moscow has, for the first time, initiated communication with Ukraine on prisoner-of-war (POW) exchanges, Ukrainian Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda on Dec. 18. &#x201C;This year, for the first time, the Russian side personally took the initiative to communicate,&#x201D; Lubinets said. &#x201C;It was at the start of the Ukrainian Armed Forces&#x2019; military operation in Kursk Oblast. I believe the Kursk operation provided strong arguments in favor of Ukraine.&#x201D; Since the beginning of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine and Russia have carried out nearly 60 prisoner exchanges. Around 3,600 Ukrainians have been freed, while tens of thousands &#x2014; both military personnel and civilians &#x2014; are estimated to remain in captivity. During the surprise incursion into Kursk Oblast, Ukraine captured hundreds of Russian conscript soldiers stationed in the region. Some of them were exchanged during the 58th swap carried out on Oct. 18. Lubinets said that Russia continues to engage in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, including in the context of prisoner exchanges, undermining Ukrainian authorities and the negotiation process. In January, a Russian Il-76 plane reportedly carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs crashed in Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast. Russia claimed all the POWs died in the crash. Ukraine, however, has not confirmed this and called for an international investigation &#x2014; a proposal Moscow rejected. The Olenivka prison, located in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, housed Ukrainian POWs and civilians, many captured after the fall of Mariupol in May 2022. In June 2022, the prison was struck by an explosion that killed at least 54 POWs and injured over 150. According to Ukrainian authorities, Russia deliberately targeted the prison, specifically the part of the building where Ukrainian Azov Regiment members had been moved to. Kyiv has claimed that Russia used artillery or a thermobaric munition in the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/kursk-operation-prompted-russias-first-pow-exchange-initiative-ombudsman-says/	2024-12-18T11:45:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1752126648.jpg
Two EU accession clusters for Ukraine to open in first half of 2025, EU official says	Two European Union accession clusters for Ukraine are expected to open during the first half of 2025 under Poland&#x2019;s presidency of the EU Council, a high-ranking EU official told The Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18. EU accession negotiations are structured according to clusters and chapters. During the negotiations, a candidate country prepares to implement EU laws and standards. Poland&#x2019;s EU presidency is set to begin on Jan. 5, 2025, with the clusters likely to be opened closer to the summer, according to the EU official. These developments align with Ukraine&#x2019;s ambitious goal of accelerating its integration into the EU. Speaking on Dec. 17, President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized Ukraine&apos;s commitment to advancing its EU accession process. &#x201C;During Poland&#x2019;s EU presidency, we expect to open at least two clusters and six in total. Our goal is very ambitious &#x2014; to open all the clusters next year,&#x201D; he said. The EU&#x2019;s Commissioner for Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, said that Ukraine could potentially join the bloc by 2029 if it successfully implements necessary reforms. The European Commission has praised Ukraine&apos;s progress in areas such as judicial reform, the rule of law, and anti-corruption measures. Ukraine was granted EU candidate status in June 2022, with the European Council approving the launch of accession talks in December 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/two-eu-accession-clusters-for-ukraine-to-open-in-first-half-of-2025-eu-official-says/	2024-12-18T10:27:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-497631536.jpg
A shake-up in Ukraine’s drone buying alarms corruption watchdogs	The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers discreetly dethroned the former czar of drone purchases &#xA0;&#x2014; Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov &#x2014; as the result of a one-sided power struggle from the Head of the President&#x2019;s Office, Andriy Yermak, allege observers. A new decree shifted a key office in the drone purchasing process away from Fedorov, and the new leader of the office is, say anti-corruption watchdogs, a yes-man for Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s closest ally who has attracted controversy over his ever-growing influence and overreach. Critics fear the responsible agency may stop reporting details on over a billion dollars a year of government drone contracts, leaving them vulnerable to embezzlement. Before February 2022, Fedorov was mostly occupied with putting government services onto mobile apps, as well as improving the lives of Ukrainian techies and IT workers. At the outset of the war, he was early to spot the increasing use of drones by Ukrainian soldiers to make up for the lack of air power and reconnaissance. From his position at the center of a network of recently militarized techies following Russia&#x2019;s invasion, Fedorov became the face of a new &#x201C;army of drones,&#x201D; a government initiative launched in July 2022 to supply the Ukrainian military with unmanned aerial vehicles. A UJ-22 Airborne (UkrJet) reconnaissance drone, bought in the frame of the program &apos;The Army of Drones&apos; readies to land during a test flight in the Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine on Aug. 2, 2022, prior to being sent to the front line. (Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)The popularity of such drones was slow to break through the traditional defense apparatus. Then-Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov downplayed the role of civilian drones in military operations, saying in December 2022, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s not idealize these Mavics. I don&#x2019;t have Mavics in my orders, just so you understand. Soldiers aren&#x2019;t asking for them,&#x201D; making fun of them as drones for filming weddings rather than fighting wars. At the time, soldiers were actually sourcing donations for Mavics, with Ukrainian civilians pitching in to send them to their favorite units. Due to Reznikov&#x2019;s attitude, Fedorov ended up spearheading government drone procurement. For his wartime work, Fedorov has become a major public persona within Ukraine and abroad, including a glowing profile in Wired magazine. He hosted a short-lived YouTube series, welcoming private start-ups to the ministry. Fedorov also drove the set-up of Brave1, which links his ministry and the Defense Ministry to sponsor military technology. Despite Fedorov&#x2019;s role, the actual budget for the government&#x2019;s drone purchases initially ended up not in the hands of the Defense Ministry nor the Digital Transformation Ministry, but rather with the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine. The Communications Service is the agency in charge of securing government and military communications and cyber defense. The Cabinet of Ministers granted Fedorov semi-formal authority over the long-overlooked Communications Service as it underwent reforms starting in 2020. As fundraising money flew into Ukraine following Russia&#x2019;s invasion, the Communications Service ended up holding the purse strings for drone fundraising by United24, a Ukrainian-government-run platform to raise money for the war effort. The situation was enshrined into law in June. The Communications Service found itself in possession of a considerable war chest as a result of these changes. The agency&#x2019;s budget for next year includes Hr 46.9 billion &#x2014; about $1.125 billion specifically allocated to drones. The service retains that drone money in a special fund far larger than its regular budget. That fund also dwarfs the size of the whole budget for the Digital Transformation Ministry, which is just under Hr 2.5 billion &#x2014; about $60 million. The service has seen scandals in the past. Former head Yuriy Shchyhol along with his deputy, Viktor Zhora, were arrested for embezzling Hr 62 billion in software last November. Viktor Zhora, a former deputy head of the State Special Communications Service, on Dec. 7, 2022. (Viktor Zhora/X)A year later, the Communications Service saw another shake-up of leadership and, as a result, control over that billion-dollar drone budget. Fedorov&#x2019;s appointee Yuriy Myronenko announced his surprise resignation from his post as head of the Communications Service on Nov. 15. Myronenko was appointed to lead the agency in charge of drone procurement after its previous head resigned amid embezzlement allegations. He himself is a former commander of a drone company in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Upon resignation, Fedorov took Myronenko into his team: Myronenko was appointed digital transformation vice minister, under Fedorov. Meanwhile, all eyes were on who would replace him at the Communications Service and be in charge of the rich drone budget. Oleksandr Potiy, longtime deputy chief of the Service, took over the job soon after Myronenko&#x2019;s resignation. The service subsequently named Rostislav Zamlynsky as Potiy&#x2019;s deputy. Just a few days later, the Cabinet of Ministers formally established that the Communications Office would report to the cabinet itself, not to Fedorov&#x2019;s Digital Transformation Ministry. Critics, including anti-corruption activists and journalists, were quick to allege that the changes indicate that the lucrative and popular direction of drone procurement was effectively taken over by the allies of Andriy Yermak, head of Zelensky&#x2019;s office. The relationship between Yermak and the new leaders of the Communications Service is not direct but widely treated as fact by critics. &#x201C;Potiy&#x2019;s a basic guy from the military. He&#x2019;s very much under the president&#x2019;s office,&#x201D; Valeriia Radchenko, a communications officer at the Anti-Corruption Action Center tells the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;There will be no super direct connections. These guys are smart enough not to put their own classmates in these positions.&#x201D; &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a man of Yermak&#x2019;s team,&#x201D; says Yuriy Nikolov, a Ukrainian journalist and investigator. Mariana Bezuhla, a member of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, also named the ouster at the Communications Service the latest of the &#x201C;intrigues of Yermak&#x201D; in a Dec. 11 Facebook post. Bezuhla is a former member of Zelensky&#x2019;s party who was excluded from it at the start of 2024.

(Viktor Kovalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&#x201C;Andriy Yermak thinks politically and sees Fedorov as a competitor. The prospect of a young, ambitious, and independent Fedorov in the role of defense minister is Andriy Borisovych (Yermak)&#x2019;s nightmare,&#x201D; Bezuhla continued, referring to Fedorov&#x2019;s wartime advancement from an initially technological station and his recent moves to expand the influence of drones across the Defense Ministry. Nikolov also points at Yermak allegedly seeing Fedorov as competition and the last standing member of the president&#x2019;s original circle. &#x201C;When Yermak went into the president&#x2019;s office in 2020, he cleared out everyone who helped Zelensky win in 2019,&#x201D; Nikolov told the Kyiv Independent, noting Fedorov as one of few who survived. Others pointed at Zamlynsky, the new deputy head of the Communications Service. His previous tenure was in the Defense Ministry at the time when it was shaken by procurement scandals. Editor-in-Chief of Ukrainian news outlet Censor.Net Yuriy Butusov likewise portrayed the Communications Service reshuffle as an unambiguous power grab on the part of Yermak in a Nov. 24 Facebook post. Butusov has been an outspoken critic of Zelensky and Yermak. &#x201C;The Head of the President&#x2019;s Office, (Andriy) Yermak, will busy himself with the drones, but the money will be allocated by the bureaucrat who controlled the finances under Reznikov,&#x201D; Butusov wrote, illustrating Fedorov&#x2019;s recent efforts to expand the influence of drones across the military. Butusov pointed to new officials who Fedorov had put forward to the chain of drone command, including a vice minister of defense and Vadym Sukharevsky as the first commander of Ukraine&#x2019;s new Unmanned Systems Force. &#x201C;As soon as Fedorov gave voice to this plan, Yermak became his fatal enemy. Yermak tries to control all internal policy.&#x201D; For his part, Fedorov put out an eminently diplomatic statement on his Telegram channel, saying that the stable of ministries said to be jockeying over drone acquisitions have &#x201C;one common goal &#x2014; to defend the country.&#x201D; &#x201C;Please, without the attempts to turn the institutions of government against each other through planted information, rumors, and hunts for empty sensationalism that nobody needs,&#x201D; wrote Fedorov. The concrete consequences of the change-up remain uncertain. Bezuhla claimed that a shortage of drones is already apparent at the front, and that &#x201C;purchases and developments in the sector have fallen critically &#x2014; literally over the course of a month by several times. Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry, over the whole of 2024 has purchased almost no drones.&#x201D; Public concern is so great that the Service has spent the first half of December releasing a series of announcements assuring that &#x201C;the delivery of drones to the front will go according to plan.&#x201D; &#x201C;All of us are working as one team, for we understand well that only quality work from every link will secure high effectiveness of the whole process,&#x201D; reads a quote the announcement attributes to Potiy. One key area of concern on the part of critics is the transparency of the Communications Service&#x2019;s drone acquisitions, specifically their published contracts. &#x201C;As of now (the new Communications Service) can find ways to close information about those contracts. They publish reports of how much they are spending on these drones,&#x201D; explains Radchenko. &#x201C;They can just make the decision to hide this kind of information, and then say that they procured drones for $1 million &#x2014; but not the price per drone.&#x201D; &#x201C;Fedorov&#x2019;s team had the brains to make these purchases public, but, legally, they have the right to make these purchases private,&#x201D; says Nikolov, whose website, Nashi Hroshi (Our Money) &#x2014; specializes in investigations based on Ukraine&#x2019;s public contracts. The ultimate fear is that &#x201C;they could take the same budget to buy half as many drones,&#x201D; Nikolov explains, noting the funds could easily be siphoned off.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Limited transparency has been at the heart of many of the scandals surrounding Ukrainian military acquisitions, many of which, unlike those civil drone purchases, aren&#x2019;t publicly reported at all. Concern over Zamlynsky&#x2019;s appointment reflects his presence in the Ukrainian Defense Ministry during a rations acquisitions scandal that helped end Oleksiy Reznikov&#x2019;s tenure as defense minister in 2023. When contacted, the Digital Transformation Ministry over which Fedorov presides directed the Kyiv Independent to the Communications Service. When reached, a press representative for the President&#x2019;s Office, which Yermak leads, directed the Kyiv Independent to the Defense Ministry and did not respond to further questions. A top advisor to Yermak did not return a request for comment. Neither the Communications Service nor the Defense Ministry returned requests for comment. A representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry directed the Kyiv Independent to a deputy minister who could not be reached. Natalia Kushnerska, the head of Brave1, which coordinates defense tech between the Defense Ministry and the Digital Transformation Ministry, would not comment on the situation when reached. Mykhailo Fedorov himself could not be reached.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-shake-up-in-ukraines-drone-buying-alarms-corruption-watchdogs/	2024-12-18T10:03:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2182889803.jpg
Sweden 'does not exclude' more direct physical presence in Ukraine to bolster defense	Sweden does not exclude the possibility of expanding its physical presence in Ukraine to strengthen the country&apos;s defenses, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent published on Dec. 18. In response to a question over whether Sweden would potentially take part in a more direct physical presence in Ukraine amid talks of potentially deploying peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire, Jonson said he doesn&apos;t &quot;exclude that possibility.&quot; The minister noted that Sweden already has a physical presence in Ukraine through its defense procurement agency that works with the Ukrainian government to purchase military equipment. Jonson also said Sweden does not rule out the possibility of conducting military training inside Ukraine. As of October, Sweden&apos;s military to support to Ukraine has amounted to around $4.4 billion since the start of the full-scale invasion. Jonson stressed the necessity of bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses against Russian aggression and said he supports extending the mandate of the EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), which coordinates military support for Kyiv. He called for urgent measures to secure peace in Ukraine by 2025, describing the situation as &#x201C;absolutely dire and extremely important.&#x201D; &#x201C;The stakes in this war are enormous for the Ukrainian people, but also for the rest of Europe,&#x201D; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-defense-minister-does-not-rule-out-eu-nato-troop-presence-in-ukraine/	2024-12-18T09:59:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2017683210.jpg
EU does not expect Ukraine war ceasefire, peace talks in near future, EU official says	The EU does not anticipate potential negotiations or a ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia in the near future, a high-ranking EU official told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 18. The official also said that there are no discussions currently ongoing at the EU level on sending European troops to Ukraine to enforce a potential ceasefire. Western leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, have reportedly considered deploying peacekeepers to monitor a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump on Dec. 12 reiterated his view that European troops should lead efforts to monitor a ceasefire, which is in line with other previous statements of his that Europe must assume more responsibility in addressing Russian aggression and European security. The EU official&apos;s comments contrast with statements made by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Dec. 10, who expressed optimism that peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine could start as early as this winter. President Volodymyr Zelensky has made it clear that Kyiv would only consider peacekeeping proposals after securing a clear timeline for NATO membership.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-eu-troops-in-ukraine-for-now-costa-highlights-integration-efforts/	2024-12-18T09:27:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183596448-1.jpg
As Lukashenko gears up for new election, Belarusian political prisoners recount horrors they endured in his prisons	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for 30 years, is looking to reelect himself for the seventh time. In the run-up to the January 2025 presidential elections, Lukashenko has pardoned prisoners convicted of extremism, claiming that it was a &quot;humane gesture&quot; toward those who had &quot;gone astray.&quot; Far from being criminals, those pardoned were political prisoners incarcerated following the public uprising sparked by Lukashenko&apos;s previous &quot;electoral victory&quot; in 2020. Kiryl, a journalist whose name has been changed due to safety concerns, became one of those political prisoners after Belarusian security services detained him on the streets of Minsk. &quot;A gun was pressed to my back, I was put into a car, a bag was pulled over my head, and I was taken to a forest,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They beat me without saying anything or making demands and then took me home where a search was already underway. After the search, I was taken for questioning, and they told me to pack my things because I wouldn&apos;t be returning home.&quot; More than 1,300 political prisoners remain in Lukashenko&apos;s prisons, according to the Belarusian human rights organization Viasna. While in custody, they face harassment and abuse by prison authorities, deprivation of medical care, harsh living conditions, and forced labor. The seventh wave of pardons issued in early December brings the total number of political prisoners released since July 2024 to 207 individuals. Those who were freed are speaking out about the ongoing terror their fellow citizens back home continue to face. Most do it anonymously to protect their family, their friends, and themselves from a new round of state-sponsored persecutions. As a journalist, Kiryl started to attract the attention of Belarusian authorities for reporting on Lukashenko&apos;s mishandling of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, during which no quarantine was imposed, and the morgues quickly became overcrowded. He also covered the humanitarian crisis that unfolded in 2021 after Lukashenko&apos;s regime transferred migrants from the Middle East to the Polish-Belarusian border to ignite tensions with the European Union, which had imposed sanctions for the political crackdowns following the 2020 presidential election. The journalist&apos;s last report before being arrested was about Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. During questioning, the security service officers asked Kiryl who had put him up to making the reports, who was paying him, and what ties he had with Poland or Ukraine. &quot;I explained I was reporting on facts,&quot; Kiryl said. &quot;How could I not report on what was happening?&quot; Kiryl was taken to Okrestina, one of Belarus&apos;s most notorious detention centers, where many of the protestors detained during the 2020 revolution were subjected to brutal torture.

(Sergei Gapon / AFP via Getty Images)The International Committee for the Investigation of Torture in Belarus documented over 100 cases of abuse at Okrestina. Former prisoners described men being beaten so severely that others could hear the sound of their bones breaking. Guards also inflicted psychological torture upon the prisoners, telling them, &quot;You&apos;ll die here.&quot; The threat of death extends beyond intimidation, though &#x2014; Viasna has documented at least seven known cases of political prisoners who have died in Lukashenko&apos;s prisons since 2020. In Okrestina, Kiryl was placed in a small cell with 12 other prisoners. All of them were forced to stand throughout the day, and they had to sleep on the floor at night. The prisoners were brought into the corridor twice daily for beatings, and the floors were washed with bleach, making it difficult to breathe. After five days, Kiryl was transferred to a pre-trial detention center where there were &quot;always more people than beds.&quot; There was no natural light in the overcrowded basement cell, and prisoners had to take turns sleeping in shifts. He spent a year there before finally facing trial. During the trial, the prosecutor openly laughed at Kiryl&apos;s lawyer while the judge ignored his defense. The prosecution accused the journalist of &quot;intentional distortion of facts,&quot; charged him with &quot;threatening national security,&quot; and sentenced him to four years in prison. There was a significant surge among Belarusians in demand for independent, high-quality news during the 2020 presidential campaign and the protests that followed, as the public sought accurate information amid a climate of state-controlled media and escalating political unrest. &quot;(People) felt the urge to act because, at that moment, we were deciding the fate of the country,&quot; Iryna Shchasnaia, who worked as an editor in independent media, told the Kyiv Independent. But she realized by the end of that summer that individuals like herself would be targeted in the growing political crackdowns, prompting her to flee the country for Kyiv. During Shchasnaia&apos;s time in Ukraine, the fear of arrest faded, and she continued to work while awaiting to reunite with her husband and child in the fall. Yet, she was filled with a deep longing for Belarus and began planning her return. &quot;I told my friends in Kyiv about my plan. They were frightened for me and said that returning to Belarus was sheer foolishness and suicide. But I stopped listening to anyone, I completely lost my sense of reality. One day, I packed my things and went home to Minsk,&quot; she said. Though she felt a sense of relief upon returning to Belarus and reuniting with her family, the arrest of several acquaintances quickly underscored the growing peril surrounding her. By November, she became increasingly aware that she was being closely monitored by authorities, who, in a stark display of intimidation, were no longer even attempting to conceal their surveillance. On the morning of Nov. 18, security service officers burst into her home. &quot;My mother and my 10-year-old son were home. It was brutal and terrifying. I deeply regret that my loved ones had to witness it,&quot; she said. &quot;Then they took me out of the apartment, and I knew it would be a very long time before I returned home.&quot; That evening, she was charged with &quot;preparing to participate in mass unrest&quot; and taken to Okrestina. &quot;The first days were a blur. I remember constantly worrying about my husband and son. I didn&apos;t know if they had managed to leave the country after my arrest,&quot; she said. By late spring, Shchasnaia had passed through two other pre-trial detention centers. At the first one, she &quot;braced for something terrible&quot; when the guard opened the door to her cell, but she was met by three other women who offered her coffee and something to eat. After being transferred in April to another pre-trial detention center in the eastern city of Mahilyow, Shchasnaia met non-political inmates but &quot;managed to find some common ground with them.&quot; Later, she shared her cell with another political prisoner and recalled how they were a source of deep emotional support for each other. By May 2021, Shchasnaia had been sentenced to four years in prison. She was transferred to a prison in the southeastern city of Homel to serve out her sentence. &quot;Somehow, I had a sense my life turned into hell with this latest development,&quot; she said. &quot;And I was right.&quot; Belarusian political prisoners&apos; uniforms are marked with a yellow tag, making them easily identifiable from other inmates. Under the watchful eye of the prison authorities, they are frequently targeted and accused of fabricated offenses. Kiryl recalled how one young man was sent to solitary confinement for failing to shave even though his face was covered in razor cuts from shaving too often out of fear of that very punishment. Torture in prison has increasingly taken the form of psychological abuse, with methods designed to erode the prisoners&apos; sense of self and hope, according to Kiryl. Yet, it was common practice just a year and a half ago for the head of the penal colony to publicly single out a political prisoner, kick him in the chest, and beat him in front of others. Some prisoners who collaborate with the prison authorities would also try to provoke political prisoners to create problems for them. While political prisoners were not isolated from one another, they understood that if they were seen communicating, they could be punished. &quot;I met one of our well-known opposition politicians there, and although we only talked about some general topics, someone snitched on us &#x2014; both of us were sent to solitary confinement for 10 days,&quot; Kiryl said. Solitary confinement consisted of a concrete floor and open windows, regardless of the season. On one occasion, Kiryl was placed there with a high fever despite deprivation of medical care being against prison regulations. The prison doctor dismissed his fever, saying that &quot;if he can stand, then he&apos;s fine.&quot; Riot police detain a man during a rally to protest against the Belarus presidential election results in Minsk, Belarus on Oct. 11, 2020.

(AFP via Getty Images)&quot;You constantly want to sleep during the day because of the cold, and at night, you can&apos;t fall asleep because you&apos;re freezing,&quot; Kiryl said. &quot;Lack of sleep led to hallucinations. They fed you small portions &#x2014; one ladle of watery broth, three tablespoons of porridge, and a piece of bread. That was a typical lunch in solitary confinement.&quot; The most physically demanding and hazardous labor was another form of psychological punishment for political prisoners, as they were assigned quotas that were nearly impossible to fill. These tasks could include extracting 10 kilograms worth of aluminum wire from dismantled cables or cutting tires from Belaz trucks to be melted down. In addition to solitary confinement, the removal of food packages, and the denial of visitation rights, other forms of punishment for not filling work quotas could include being forced to treat wooden products with bleach without being provided masks or gloves, leading to burns on prisoners&apos; hands and the loss of taste and smell for weeks. Female prisoners face similar harsh treatment at the hands of prison authorities. &quot;There wasn&apos;t a single day (at the prison in Homel) where you didn&apos;t feel your life was in danger,&quot; Shchasnaia recalled. &quot;In winter, you&apos;re made to carry sacks of snow or chip ice from the asphalt. In the summer, you&apos;re called to do &apos;inventory work,&apos; where you haul scrap metal, and no one cares how you feel about it,&quot; she said. The female prisoners were also required to work shifts in a factory, where they were tasked with sewing military uniforms. Refusal to comply led to immediate punishment, often in the form of solitary confinement, where conditions were also &quot;unbearable.&quot; &quot;From the first day in a penal colony, the administration makes it clear how they treat political prisoners,&quot; Shchasnaia explained. &quot;We are perceived as enemies of the people who shouldn&apos;t expect any mercy.&quot; Though intended as a temporary punishment measure, solitary confinement in Belarus has been imposed for extended periods on some of the country&apos;s most prominent political figures. Maria Kalesnikava, who helped lead opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya&apos;s presidential campaign in 2020, was detained by authorities and sentenced to 11 years in prison after she refused to be exiled. Despite being in critical health, Kalesnikava was placed in solitary confinement in November 2022. Her family and lawyers lost contact with her in February 2023, and nothing was known about her condition until mid-November of this year, when a photo surfaced showing her hugging and smiling alongside her father, who was finally allowed to see her. In early December, Lukashenko issued his seventh wave of &quot;pardons,&quot; releasing 29 more political prisoners, including the elderly and those with chronic illnesses. Kiryl was among those who were pardoned, signing a document that secured his release. &quot;Recent releases of political prisoners are partly due to the constant pressure on the regime but also an attempt by Lukashenko to send a signal to the West: &apos;Look, this is an act of humanity, I&apos;m releasing people.&apos; Of course, it&apos;s all a game, and we must not fall for these tricks. We&apos;ve seen this in past years. It&apos;s important to note that while, say, 50 people are released, twice as many are imprisoned during the same period,&quot; Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Estonian media in mid-November. &quot;If someone submits a petition for pardon, this should never be condemned &#x2013; because these people are innocent. If it&apos;s their only chance to save their lives, then it&apos;s understandable why they might take this step.&quot; Demonstrators paste photos of opposition supporters killed during the post-election protests on the Okrestina prison wall during a rally demanding to free jailed activists of the opposition in Minsk, Belarus on Oct. 4, 2020. (AFP via Getty Images)Some political prisoners, like Shchasnaia, serve their full sentence. Upon her release in 2024, Shchasnaia was placed under &quot;supervision,&quot; which meant that she was constantly monitored by police, subjected to curfews, and banned from attending public gatherings. If the police recorded three &quot;violations,&quot; then she could be sent back to prison. &quot;I decided not to wait (for them to find reasons to send me back). Two days later, I left Belarus,&quot; she said. Now in exile, Shchasnaia is trying to rebuild her life, but the path forward often seems daunting and unclear &#x2014; thoughts of home in Belarus continue to pull at her. &quot;But returning there means returning to prison,&quot; she said. &quot;So I have to learn to live abroad. I have to believe in a better future. I hope that one day I&apos;ll return to my beloved Minsk.&quot; For Kiryl, the challenges of life in exile, like finding a new apartment or learning a new language, are overshadowed by the newfound freedom of walking the streets and living without fear. &quot;In Belarus, there&apos;s constant fear. You only need to look at the people walking down the street: they&apos;re frightened, grey, broken,&quot; he said. &quot;(But abroad) there&apos;s no anxiety that someone is always watching you, no worry that opening a chat or channel will lead to trouble simply for reading the &apos;wrong&apos; article.&quot; According to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), up to 500,000 Belarusians have fled the country since 2020. As the exile community grows, those who have been abroad longer try to offer guidance in online chat groups, helping newcomers with resources to navigate the challenges of rebuilding their lives. &quot;It&apos;s wonderful to feel that kind of support (from other Belarusians),&quot; Kiryl said. &quot;Most of our conversations are about the future &#x2014; hoping that one day we can return home or at least visit freely.&quot; Belarusians continue to face arrest and imprisonment for their involvement in the 2020 protests against the rigged election. According to Viasna, at least 671 politically motivated repressions, including detentions and searches, were reported in November alone. Given the ongoing attacks against political dissent, no genuine opposition candidates are expected to run in the 2025 presidential election, and protests on the scale of those in 2020 seem unlikely. With the opposition largely silenced, Lukashenko appears poised to secure another five-year presidential term. In the struggle to shine a light on these political prisoners, human rights organizations also find themselves navigating a delicate balancing act &#x2014; working to raise awareness about their plight without inadvertently exacerbating their suffering.

(Grigory Sysoyev POOL/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;The authorities cut off human rights defenders and society from information about political prisoners, and we are sometimes forced to limit our activities so as not to cause more harm to them. A broad information campaign can cause additional repression,&quot; Pavel Sapelka, a board member of Viasna, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The human rights situation in Belarus is catastrophic &#x2014; every political prisoner is under the threat of torture as well as cruel forced labor with virtually no pay. The worst thing is that at any moment, the list of the dead and other victims of the Belarusian regime can increase.&quot; Belarusians in exile, especially those who survived Lukashenko&apos;s prisons, hope the world won&apos;t forget that their fight for democracy is far from over and that countless Belarusians have already spilled blood for it. &quot;This is our personal, national tragedy,&quot; Kiryl said. &quot;but it will be terrifying if we are left alone with it.&quot; Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan. Thank you for taking the time to read this article. The Belarusian people&apos;s ongoing struggle for a better future is both courageous and inspiring. Despite bravely facing Lukashenko&apos;s harsh authoritarian regime, their efforts receive far too little attention. They deserve greater recognition and our unwavering support.

Ukraine delivered 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Umerov says	Ukraine has delivered more than 200,000 domestically-produced drones to front-line units so far in December, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov wrote in a Facebook post on Dec. 18. &quot;Alongside equipment from our partners, more and more Ukrainian-made weapons are already operating on the frontlines &#x2014; a joint effort of defenders and manufacturers,&quot; Umerov said. Domestically manufactured drones help Kyiv close the ammunition gap as they face Russian forces with more artillery shells on the battlefield. Ukraine also aims to ramp up the production of long-range drones and missiles as part of the country&apos;s resilience plan. Zelensky previously said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones in 2025, used to target Russian warships, naval bases, oil refineries, and airfields inside occupied territories and deep behind enemy lines. The Unmanned Systems Forces was established in September to improve Ukraine&apos;s work with drones, form special drone-specific units, and improve the production, training, and innovation of unmanned vehicles. Various aerial, naval, and ground drones have been developed and often successfully used for reconnaissance, combat, and other tasks throughout the full-scale with Russia. The Ukrainian military has proven to be a pioneer in drone technology, using innovative ways to undermine Russia&apos;s material and numerical advantage. Aerial drones have been used to ram into Russian helicopters or drop molten metal on ground positions, while naval drones were a key component in upending Russia&apos;s dominance in the Black Sea. In turn, Russia has also widely deployed drone capabilities during the full-scale invasion, both on the battlefield and to attack Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-delivered-200-000-domestically-produced-drones-to-front-line-units-so-far-in-december-umerov-says/	2024-12-18T06:15:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168760161.jpg
Intercepted Russian phone call suggests North Korean troops suffering trainloads of wounded	An intercepted phone call released by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on Dec. 18 suggests North Korean troops are suffering hundreds of casualties fighting for Russia in Kursk Oblast. In the call, a nurse at a Moscow hospital tells her husband, a soldier fighting in Kursk Oblast, that wounded fighters are being brought in by the trainload. &quot;Yesterday there was a train with about 100 people. Today there are 120 &#x2014; that&apos;s already (about) 200,&quot; she says. &quot;How many more are there? God only knows,&quot; she adds. She also claims that wards are being emptied to make way for the North Korean wounded, and hospital staff have trouble communicating with them and are not allowed to speak to them in English. &quot;Are they elite, or what, these Koreans? We are freeing up certain wards for them,&quot; she says. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the veracity or contents of the call, but the claims made are in line with recent Western estimates of North Korean losses. A couple hundred North Korean troops have been killed or wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast against Ukraine, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 17, citing a senior U.S. military official. The official did not give an exact figure but said the high casualty rate was in part due to the soldiers&apos; lack of battle experience. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Ukraine&apos;s &#xA0;Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. Despite the losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17 that Russian and North Korean forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row.	https://kyivindependent.com/intercepted-russian-call-suggests-north-korean-troops-suffering-trainloads-of-wounded/	2024-12-18T05:28:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166040844.jpg
US may not be able to send remaining $5.6bn in military aid to Ukraine before Trump takes office, NYT reports	The U.S. may run out of time to deliver the remaining $5.6bn in military aid allocated to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes office next month, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Dec. 17. &quot;We will continue to do drawdown packages for the remainder of this administration,&quot; a U.S. official told the NYT. &quot;But $5.6 billion is a substantial amount of authority, so I would certainly anticipate that there could be remaining authority that would transition and be available for the next administration to use,&quot; they added. Although the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden plans to allocate some funds from the presidential drawdown authority, it is unlikely to spend the whole amount. The presidential drawdown authority is a scheme that allows any U.S. President to transfer weapons from the Pentagon&#x2019;s own stockpile instead of ordering it from manufacturers that would take precious time. The U.S. gave more than $60 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine during the Biden administration. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. There are concerns that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its military support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russia&#x2019;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-may-not-be-able-to-send-remaining-5-6bn-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-before-trump-takes-office-nyt-reports/	2024-12-18T04:27:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170417898.jpg
Slovak PM Robert Fico to discuss gas transit through Ukraine with EU chief	Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico will hold talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Dec. 19, to discuss the possibility of continuing its gas transit through Ukraine beyond 2024, Reuters reported on Dec. 18. Slovakia currently imports 3 billion cubic meters of gas per year through Ukraine from Russia&#x2019;s energy giant Gazprom. Kyiv recently said it will not prolong the deal that allowed Russian gas to transit to the EU through Ukrainian territory beyond its expiry date on Dec. 31. &quot;I take into account the decision of the Ukrainian government that they do not want to extend the contract with Gazprom,&quot; Fico told Slovakia&apos;s European Affairs Committee. &quot;But that does not mean we cannot take gas from the east,&quot; he added. Fico also said Slovakia is exploring the possibilities to receive non-Russian gas through Ukraine, and will aim to secure the EU Commission&#x2019;s backing during Thursday&#x2019;s talks for future negotiations. He did not elaborate on who would replace Russian gas in the country&#x2019;s import of energy. Kyiv is open to negotiating gas transit for any origin, except Russian, its Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told his Slovakian counterpart on Dec. 18. Despite Europe&apos;s efforts to wean itself off of Russian fossil fuels in the wake of a full-scale invasion, many countries remain heavily dependent on Russian gas, with Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria among the main buyers. Landlocked countries in central-Europe have been depending on Ukraine&#x2019;s transit to receive Russia&#x2019;s gas. Slovakia&apos;s state-owned energy company SPP and its partners in Hungary, Italy, and Austria called for continued gas transit through Ukraine in a declaration published on Dec. 17. SPP chairman Vojtech Ferencz said that replacing the entire volume of gas transiting from Ukraine would cost the company an additional 150 million euros ($157 million). A Russian-friendly populist, Fico halted military aid to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks after taking office in September 2023 in a stark foreign policy reversal. He recently announced he had accepted the Kremlin&apos;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-pm-robert-fico-to-discuss-gas-transit-through-ukraine-with-eu-chief/	2024-12-18T03:23:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2188638934.jpg
Zelensky to meet NATO chief Rutte, EU allies during talks in Brussels	President Volodymyr Zelensky will travel to Brussels on Dec. 18. to meet with the leaders of European allies, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Zelensky is expected to meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the EU to discuss military and humanitarian aid a month before Donald Trump enters the White House in January 2025. Trump has promised to push for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. Frugal with details, the president-elect has hinted at reducing military aid to Ukraine to force it to the negotiating table. Ukraine&apos;s allies have doubled down on economic and military support for Kyiv in attempts to strengthen the war-torn nation&apos;s hand before any potential peace talks. Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration&apos;s incoming Ukraine peace envoy will visit Kyiv to hold discussions with senior Ukrainian leaders in Kyiv in early January. He will also visit several European capitals, but will not travel to Moscow. His visit underscores the incoming Trump administration&#x2019;s intent to end the conflict as soon as possible. However, former national security and intelligence officials have expressed skepticism regarding the feasibility of Trump&#x2019;s intentions, pointing out that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have little incentive to negotiate under conditions acceptable to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-meet-nato-chief-rutte-eu-allies-during-talks-in-brussels/	2024-12-18T02:27:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185712185.jpg
Peace talks with Russia only possible when Moscow runs out of resources, Ukraine’s Yermak says	Peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow will only be possible when Russia has run out of resources to fight its full-scale war, Andriy Yermak, head of the Presidential Office, said on Dec. 17. &quot;I would like to emphasize once again that only the strong are helped, so we must remain strong,&quot; he told the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Lviv, in comments reported by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). &quot;Real negotiations for a lasting peace will begin only when the enemy no longer has the resources to continue the war,&quot; he added. With no military plan in sight to retake lost territories, pressure is mounting on Kyiv to enter into peace negotiations with Russia. But Yermak warned that any concessions to Russia would only allow it to replenish its army and launch a new offensive in the future. &quot;If Russia is not forced to make a just peace, there will be no peace. There will be a pause and Moscow will use this pause to restore forces and continue the offensive,&quot; Yermak said. During the same event, President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for negotiating with Moscow about peace over Ukraine&#x2019;s head &quot;without leverage.&quot; Prime Minister Orban flew to Moscow in July during a so-called &quot;peace-mission&quot; and phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. &quot;How will he put pressure on Putin? With a joke, a smile? Let him keep it,&quot; Zelensky said. Slovak President Peter Pellegrini, also argued in December that achieving peace in Ukraine would likely require accepting partial territorial losses and called for the immediate start of peace negotiations. However, some of Ukraine&#x2019;s European allies rejected such ideas, with Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski earlier this month arguing that Western nations should push Russia, not Ukraine, into peace negotiations to stop the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/peace-talks-with-russia-only-possible-when-moscow-runs-out-of-resources-ukraines-yermak-says/	2024-12-18T00:52:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
Russia detains two suspects over assassination of General Igor Kirillov, Kremlin media reports	Russian security forces have detained two suspects over the assassination of a top Kremlin general and his assistant in Moscow, Russian media reported on Dec. 18. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his assistant were killed in Moscow on Dec. 17, with a bomb attached to a scooter. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Kommersant and several other Russian outlets cited by independent news website Meduza, the two suspects carried out the killings on the orders of the SBU. They were detained by police who saw surveillance cameras&#x2019; footage from the scene which recorded a pair of suspicious cars. Russian Telegram channel 112 said the suspects had already confessed to authorities. One, a 29-year-old male, reportedly said he flew to Moscow where he rented a car, installed cameras to record the explosion, and used a homemade explosive device. According to his alleged testimony, he was promised $100,000 for the murder and was in touch with an SBU officer through a messaging app. Russian officials have not yet announced the conclusion of the investigation. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Kirillov, 54, was the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops (RKhBZ). A day before his assassination, Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. Moscow&apos;s forces have been increasingly deploying gas attacks against Ukrainian troops, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August found, and Kirillov has since been sanctioned by the U.K. and Canada for his role in their use. &quot;Kirillov was a war criminal and a completely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 17. &quot;Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-detains-two-suspects-over-assassination-of-general-igor-kirillov-kremlin-media-reports/	2024-12-17T23:30:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189847816.jpg
Couple hundred' North Korean troops lost fighting for Russia against Ukraine, AP reports	A couple hundred North Korean troops have been killed or wounded fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast against Ukraine, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Dec. 17, citing a senior U.S. military official. The official did not give an exact figure but said the high casualty rate was in part due to the soldiers&apos; lack of battle experience. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Ukraine&apos;s &#xA0;Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. Despite the losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17 that Russian and North Korean forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row. &quot;For the third day, Russian forces have been conducting intensive offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, actively using North Korean units,&quot; Syrskyi said in an online address to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities held in Lviv, according to Interfax-Ukraine. Citing Ukrainian soldiers, The Economist wrote that Ukraine likely lost around half of the territory it had captured in the initial phase of the operation in August and September. An officer talking to the outlet connected this development to the redeployment of elite units that first spearheaded the offensive. Ukraine likely seeks to hold on to a piece of Russian territory as a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/couple-hundred-north-korean-troops-lost-fighting-for-russia-against-ukraine-ap-reports/	2024-12-17T22:47:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 766,690 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 766,690 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 18. This number includes 1,580 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,571 tanks, 19,772 armored fighting vehicles, 31,610 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,164 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,025 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,470 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-766-690-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-17T22:25:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1997061526.jpg
Gazprom shares fall to 16-year low	Shares of Russian gas giant Gazprom fell to their lowest level since January 2009, The Moscow Times reported on Dec. 17. The shares dropped to 106.1 rubles ($1.01) on Tuesday, marking a 2.4% drop from Monday and a 33.5% decline since the start of 2024. The fall began after the European Commission announced its readiness to halt Russian gas transit without significant price impacts, confirming the availability of alternative supply sources. Gazprom&apos;s profits have suffered due to a steep decline in European exports, which have dropped over 80% compared to 2021. Additionally, Austrian oil and gas company &#x201C;OMV&#x201D; recently ended its long-term gas supply contract with Gazprom. Moscow has also heavily taxed Gazprom&apos;s revenues over the last two years and the company paid $28 billion to the government in 2023, accounting for 9% of the government&apos;s revenue last year. Oleg Abelev, head of the analytical department at Rikom-Trust investment company, predicted that Gazprom&apos;s shares will likely hover between 100-115 rubles ($.96-$1.10) per share in the near future.	https://kyivindependent.com/gazprom-shares-fall-to-16-year-low/	2024-12-17T21:30:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
Oscars shortlist includes two Ukrainian documentaries	The Ukrainian documentaries &#x201C;The Porcelain War&#x201D; and &#x201C;Once Upon a Time in Ukraine&#x201D; have been shortlisted for the 97th Academy Awards, the U.S. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Dec. 17. &#x201C;The Porcelain War,&#x201D; directed by Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev, is among 15 films selected for the Documentary Feature Film category, chosen from a total of 169 eligible submissions. The film follows three artists who join the Ukrainian army during the war, while continuing to create porcelain figurines as an act of resistance. In the Documentary Short Film category, &#x201C;Once Upon a Time in Ukraine,&#x201D; co-directed by Betsy West and Earl Mack and co-produced by Ukraine and the U.S., advanced to the shortlist. The documentary portrays war through the eyes of Ukrainian children and shows how they use creativity and imagination to cope with the hardships. &#x201C;La Palisade,&#x201D; a film by Philip Sotnychenko, was nominated by the Ukrainian Oscar committee as Ukraine&#x2019;s entry for Best International Feature Film, but it did not make the shortlist. In 2024, the Ukrainian documentary &#x201C;20 Days in Mariupol&#x201D;, directed by Mstyslav Chernov, made history as the first Ukrainian film to win an Oscar, taking home the Best Documentary Feature award. The film also earned the BAFTA award for Best Documentary earlier that year. The documentary recorded the Russian siege of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast from the perspective of Chernov and his crew during the first weeks of the full-scale invasion. The film comprises 30 hours of footage they shot in Mariupol amid the siege.	https://kyivindependent.com/oscars-shortlist-includes-two-ukrainian-documentaries/	2024-12-17T19:53:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1245538531.jpg
Rheinmetall to provide Ukraine with 20 more Marder infantry fighting vehicles	German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall has received an order to supply Ukraine with 20 additional Marder infantry fighting vehicles, the company announced on Dec. 17. The delivery is scheduled for the first half of 2025, with the contract valued in the tens of millions of euros, funded by Germany. The statement by Rheinmetall noted that the Marder 1A3 model features enhanced targeting capabilities through a laser rangefinder. Rheinmetall has so far transferred about 200 combat vehicles, including over a hundred Marder 1A3 models, to Ukraine directly or indirectly through the so-called circular exchange program. The German manufacturer first received an order for the Marder infantry fighting vehicles in March 2023. In late July, Rheinmetall announced that it had received an order from the Ukrainian government to begin the construction of an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The company previously said it planned to open at least four production plants in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/rheinmetall-to-provide-ukraine-with-20-more-marder-infantry-fighting-vehicles/	2024-12-17T17:47:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2154591881.jpg
Trump's Ukraine peace envoy plans January trip to Kyiv, European capitals, Reuters reports	The Trump administration&apos;s incoming Ukraine peace envoy, Keith Kellogg, plans to visit Kyiv and several European capitals in early January as part of the new administration&#x2019;s effort to address the Russia-Ukraine war, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Kellogg, who will serve as President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, does not intend to travel to Moscow during this trip, the sources said. Instead, he will hold discussions with senior Ukrainian leaders in Kyiv. Kellogg&apos;s team is also arranging meetings in other European cities, including Rome and Paris, though the itinerary remains subject to change, one source added. The meetings are expected to focus on &quot;fact-finding&quot; to inform the incoming Trump administration, rather than launching formal negotiations, according to the sources. However, the trip signals the urgency Trump has placed on resolving the war in Ukraine. Trump has pledged to end the war within 24 hours of assuming office, however, he hasn&apos;t provided details on how he plans to do it. At his first news conference since winning the election, Trump voiced his intention to make &quot;a little progress&quot; toward ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking from Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16, he called the war &quot;horrible&quot; and underscored the urgent need to bring it to an end. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to get a little progress. It&#x2019;s a tough one, it&#x2019;s a nasty one, it&#x2019;s nasty.&quot; Former national security and intelligence officials have expressed skepticism, pointing out that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have little incentive to negotiate under conditions acceptable to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-ukraine-peace-envoy-plans-january-trip-to-kyiv-european-capitals-reuters-reports/	2024-12-17T15:54:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228656063.jpg
Poland-Ukraine relations show progress on historical issues, defense cooperation, Tusk says	President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Lviv on Dec. 17 to discuss bilateral cooperation, historical reconciliation, and coordination with Western partners. Both leaders reported progress in addressing complex historical issues, including the legacy of the Volyn massacre. Zelensky highlighted the ongoing collaboration between the Ukrainian and Polish Ministries of Culture on historical matters, saying: &quot;There is cooperation, there are meetings, joint work has begun, and there is progress in this.&quot; Tusk acknowledged the challenges but emphasized that history &quot;certainly cannot divide us.&quot; Poland has long sought progress on the exhumation of victims of the 1940s events in Volyn, and Tusk expressed an understanding of Ukraine&apos;s current challenges. He reaffirmed that historical complexities would not undermine the strong alliance between the two states. The leaders also discussed the front-line situation, diplomatic strategies, and the need for a just peace. Tusk underscored the importance of unwavering Western support, warning against speculation of a Ukrainian defeat, which he dismissed as baseless. Zelensky emphasized the shared vision of a strong and secure Ukraine supported by Western unity. Expectations for Poland&apos;s upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2024 were addressed, along with discussions on defense cooperation. Zelensky expressed gratitude for Poland&apos;s military aid and its support for Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO and EU aspirations. Tusk reaffirmed Poland&apos;s steadfast backing for Ukraine&apos;s European integration and security objectives, calling it vital for regional stability. The ongoing dialogue over the Volyn massacre continues to be a sensitive issue in Polish-Ukrainian relations. While Polish officials characterize the events as genocide perpetrated by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), Ukrainian officials have called for recognizing shared responsibility for the violence, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Poles and Ukrainians during World War II. Both sides view continued engagement as crucial for reconciliation.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-ukraine-relations-see-progress-in-historical-dialogue-defense-cooperation-tusk-says/	2024-12-17T13:57:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/ad251d9b370ace3d876b64ad229cbd6c_1734456764.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine's SBU assassinates Russian general charged with chemical weapons crimes	Key developments on Dec. 17: Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, was killed in Moscow on Dec. 17 in an operation of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. Kirillov and another Russian service member were reportedly killed in an explosion on the morning of Dec. 17 in the Russian capital. Ukrainian prosecutors previously charged the commander with using banned chemical weapons in the war against Ukraine. According to the source, explosives attached to a scooter detonated when Kirillov and his aide were near the entrance of the house on Ryazansky Prospect in Moscow. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purportedly shows the explosion in Moscow, Russia, that killed Russian Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. (SBU source)&quot;Kirillov was a war criminal and completely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; the source said. &quot;Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.&quot; According to the Mash Telegram channel, the explosion occurred at around 6 a.m. local time when a service car arrived for Kirillov. The pro-state outlet Kommersant reported that the general and his aide were killed by a homemade explosive device of around 300 grams of a TNT equivalent. Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee began investigating the case as terrorism. Two undisclosed sources told the Russian RBC news agency that the investigators consider Ukraine&apos;s involvement the most likely scenario. Moscow&apos;s forces have been increasingly deploying gas attacks against Ukrainian troops, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August showed. Ukrainian soldiers and officers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent acknowledged that the tactic is effective, allowing Moscow to capture positions occasionally without destroying them. In October, the U.K. issued sanctions against Kirillov and his unit over the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. The officer held senior positions within the radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops since 2012 and was appointed the department&apos;s chief in 2017, Meduza reports. Kirillov has also repeatedly disseminated false narratives about U.S.-backed &quot;bio laboratories&quot; in Ukraine, supposedly researching biological weapons for use against Russia. Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces killed 50 North Korean soldiers and injured 47 others in three days of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit said on Dec. 17. The Special Operation Forces published footage of first-person-view (FPV) drones successfully targeting soldiers and equipment on the battlefield. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. &quot;Soldiers of the 8th Special Forces Regiment of Prince Izyaslav Mstislavich organized a warm welcome for North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast,&quot; the unit said on Facebook. Two armored vehicles, two cars, and one all-terrain vehicle were also allegedly hit. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. After reporting initial but limited clashes with North Korean troops in November, Ukraine said that over the weekend, Russia also began using the soldiers in ground assaults. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency (HUR) said that 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or injured during assaults on Dec. 14-15. The full extent of North Korean losses might be hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean personnel had engaged in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and suffered their first casualties. Russian forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17, as Ukrainian forces are on the defensive in the border region. &quot;For the third day, Russian forces have been conducting intensive offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, actively using North Korean units,&quot; Syrskyi said in an online address to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities held in Lviv, according to Interfax-Ukraine. Russia reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. &quot;North Korean mercenaries have already suffered heavy losses,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s commander said, adding that Kyiv&apos;s troops are holding the defenses, destroying personnel and equipment. The Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties.

An officer talking to the outlet connected this development to the redeployment of elite units that first spearheaded the offensive. Ukraine likely seeks to hold on to a piece of Russian territory as a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has no leverage over Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine does not need his mediation in potential peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 17. &#x201C;Ukraine is a strong country and has proven it on the battlefield throughout Putin&apos;s aggression. Does anyone else in Europe have this experience now? No. Does Orban have such an army? No. How will he put pressure on Putin? With a joke, a smile? Let him keep it,&#x201D; Zelensky said, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. Hungary has maintained close ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, frequently criticizing EU sanctions on Russia and blocking military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said that Ukraine needs direct relations with the United States, rejecting Orban&apos;s role as an intermediary. &#x201C;Prime Minister Orban... will not succeed. I won&#x2019;t let him or people like him in,&#x201D; he said, clarifying that his remarks were directed at Orban, not the Hungarian people, who he argued overwhelmingly support Ukraine. Zelensky&#x2019;s comments followed escalating tensions after Orban&#x2019;s recent phone call with Putin and his criticism of Zelensky for allegedly rejecting a Christmas ceasefire proposal. Ukrainian officials have dismissed these claims, emphasizing their focus on achieving a just peace through strength. &#x201C;Negotiations on a sustainable peace will begin only when the enemy does not have the resources to continue the war,&#x201D; Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Dec. 17, adding that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory plan was created to bolster its position. For the first time, a majority of Polish citizens support ending the war in Ukraine even if it requires Ukraine to cede territory, Polish Radio reported on Dec. 17, citing a survey by the Polish Center for Public Opinion Research (CBOS). The survey found that 55% of respondents prioritized ending the conflict over Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity, up from 39% in September 2024 and 26% in April 2022. Only 31% of Poles believe Ukraine should continue fighting without concessions to Russia, a significant drop from 46% in September 2024 and 59% in April 2022. CBOS noted that this shift reflects a growing fatigue with the ongoing war, especially as Polish society had previously been predominantly in favor of Ukraine continuing the fight. The survey highlighted that younger Poles aged 18-24, residents of smaller cities, individuals with less education, and those with more conservative views were more likely to support a negotiated peace. In contrast, a recent poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) revealed that nearly two-thirds of Ukrainians remain willing to endure the war &quot;as long as it takes.&quot; This figure has declined slightly from 73% in late 2023 to 63% in October 2024, but the majority still firmly reject territorial concessions. The contrasting attitudes underscore the challenges facing Ukraine as it braces for renewed Russian offensives and continued pressure from some Western quarters for negotiations. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov recently stated Moscow&#x2019;s aim to fully occupy Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts by 2025, signaling no intent to halt aggression. President-elect Donald Trump also weighed in on the conflict during a Dec. 16 news conference, describing the war as &#x201C;horrible&#x201D; and expressing his intent to make &#x201C;a little progress&#x201D; toward peace, though he provided no specifics. Trump has previously suggested reducing U.S. aid to Ukraine to pressure both sides into negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraines-sbu-assassinates-russian-general-charged-with-chemical-weapons-crimes/	2024-12-17T13:51:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189820966.jpg
MP Boyko calls Putin 'war criminal', apologizes for pro-Russian statement after interrogation	Lawmaker Yuriy Boyko on Dec. 17 apologized for his earlier video interpreted by many as pro-Russian and called Russian President Vladimir Putin a &quot;war criminal.&quot; Boiko made the apology in a TikTok video after he was questioned by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) over his previous statement. &#x201C;I do not want my words to be used by the Russian Federation or war criminal Putin to justify their aggression against our country,&#x201D; Boyko said. &quot;If my words insulted some Ukrainians who are fighting on the front line or working on the home front to achieve victory, I want to apologize.&quot; He added that &#x201C;we should all be united, focused on defeating the foreign enemy, and put aside all internal differences.&#x201D; In his Dec. 14 video on TikTok, Boyko echoed pro-Russian narratives about alleged &#x201C;radicals&#x201D; in Ukraine and restrictions on language and religion. Boyko claimed that &#x201C;radicals&#x201D; were &#x201C;tearing down monuments, renaming cities, forbidding people to speak their native language and attend the church of their choice&#x201D; without citing specific examples or evidence. Boyko, a parliamentary member since 2007 and former deputy prime minister under ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, has a long history in Moscow-aligned political factions. His recent statements and subsequent apology suggest an attempt to navigate Ukraine&#x2019;s political landscape, potentially aiming to rebuild his relevance ahead of potential elections. In wartime Ukraine, however, pro-Russian rhetoric provokes fierce criticism and could hinder Boyko&#x2019;s political rehabilitation.	https://kyivindependent.com/pro-russian-mp-boyko-retracts-claims-on-radicals-condemns-putin-after-public-outrage/	2024-12-17T13:13:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1201665758.jpg
NATO takes lead in coordinating Western military aid to Ukraine, Reuters reports	NATO has assumed responsibility for coordinating Western military aid to Ukraine through the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) center, Reuters reported on Dec. 17, citing its sources. The center, located at a U.S. military base in Wiesbaden, Germany, is now &quot;fully operational.&quot; Established following the Alliance&#x2019;s July 2024 summit in Washington, the organization aims to streamline training programs and the delivery of weapons to Ukraine. It involves approximately 700 personnel, including troops stationed at NATO&apos;s SHAPE headquarters in Belgium and logistics centers in Poland and Romania. This shift marks a greater role for NATO in supporting Kyiv&#x2019;s defense against Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Diplomatic sources noted that the transfer of authority to NATO might have limited impact, as the U.S., under President-elect Donald Trump, could still reduce its support for Ukraine. Trump, who has signaled a potential reduction in U.S. aid, met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Dec. 7. While the meeting did not produce a specific peace plan, Trump advocated for an immediate ceasefire, while Zelensky stressed the importance of security guarantees for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-takes-lead-in-coordinating-western-military-aid-to-ukraine-reuters-says/	2024-12-17T12:30:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183596448-1.jpg
Russia may encircle Ukrainian forces near Velyka Novosilka, monitoring group says	Russian troops may encircle Ukrainian forces near Velyka Novosilka, located 74 kilometers from the regional center of Donetsk, the monitoring group DeepState reported on Dec. 17. DeepState, an independent mapping project known for its close ties to Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry and widely trusted for accurate territorial updates, highlighted that Russian operations in the area aim to sever logistics and occupy the village. According to DeepState&apos;s map, Ukrainian troops in Makarivka south of Velyka Novosilka have been almost surrounded. Analysts warn that the situation around Makarivka is becoming more critical as Russian troops continue their advances. A recent Russian raid on Novyi Komar, just 4 kilometers north of Velyka Novosilka, achieved partial success, with Russian forces reportedly entering the village. The DeepState monitoring group map, as of December 17. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi previously described the ongoing Russian offensive as &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Over the autumn, Russian forces have achieved operational gains in southern Donetsk Oblast, particularly near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk, while also advancing on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-intensifies-push-to-encircle-ukrainian-forces-in-donetsks-velyka-novosilka-analysts-say/	2024-12-17T12:14:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162045293.jpg
Most Poles favor Ukraine peace deal with territorial concessions, poll finds	For the first time, a majority of Polish citizens support ending the war in Ukraine even if it requires Ukraine to cede territory, Polish Radio reported on Dec. 17, citing a survey by the Polish Center for Public Opinion Research (CBOS). The survey found that 55% of respondents prioritized ending the conflict over Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity, up from 39% in September 2024 and 26% in April 2022. Only 31% of Poles believe Ukraine should continue fighting without concessions to Russia, a significant drop from 46% in September 2024 and 59% in April 2022. CBOS noted that this shift reflects a growing fatigue with the ongoing war, especially as Polish society had previously been predominantly in favor of Ukraine continuing the fight. The survey highlighted that younger Poles aged 18-24, residents of smaller cities, individuals with less education, and those with more conservative views were more likely to support a negotiated peace. In contrast, a recent poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) revealed that nearly two-thirds of Ukrainians remain willing to endure the war &quot;as long as it takes.&quot; This figure has declined slightly from 73% in late 2023 to 63% in October 2024, but the majority still firmly reject territorial concessions. The contrasting attitudes underscore the challenges facing Ukraine as it braces for renewed Russian offensives and continued pressure from some Western quarters for negotiations. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov recently stated Moscow&#x2019;s aim to fully occupy Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts by 2025, signaling no intent to halt aggression. President-elect Donald Trump also weighed in on the conflict during a Dec. 16 news conference, describing the war as &#x201C;horrible&#x201D; and expressing his intent to make &#x201C;a little progress&#x201D; toward peace, though he provided no specifics. Trump has previously suggested reducing U.S. aid to Ukraine to pressure both sides into negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-fatigue-grows-in-poland-majority-prioritize-peace-over-ukraines-sovereignty/	2024-12-17T10:59:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1239548149.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 158	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 158 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Dec. 9-14, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. The Cabinet of Ministers completes the composition of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s new supervisory board. On Dec. 10, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the candidacies of three state representatives for Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board, completing the set of board candidates. The three new state representatives are: As we reported earlier, the Cabinet approved four new independent members of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board on Nov. 27: Patrick Roland Graichen, Luigi de Francisci, Jeppe Sebastian Kofod, and Jan Henrik Montell. See Issue 156 for more detail. According to Ukrenergo&#x2019;s charter, its supervisory board should consist of seven members: four independent members and three state representatives. The new composition of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board is thus complete. All the above candidates are to be appointed as supervisory board members by a decision of the Ministry of Energy in its capacity as the general shareholders meeting of Ukrenergo. As it follows from the information below, such a decision must have been made. On Dec. 12, the newly appointed Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board held its first meeting. Jeppe Kofod (independent member) was elected as the board&#x2019;s Chair, while Anatolii Hulei (state representative) became his Deputy. The supervisory board also established an audit committee, a nomination and remuneration committee, and an investment and strategy committee, as well as &#x201C;made up its mind&#x201D; on their chairs. Ukrenergo did not specify the names of committee chairs. G7 Ambassadors welcomed the appointment of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s new supervisory board. The new board should launch the selection of a new CEO without delay, they emphasized. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. According to the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement between Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo had to be re-established by end-December 2024. This is a conditionality for Ukraine&#x2019;s access to about $1.1 billion under the IMF program. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member would be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure. The selection of all board members &#x2013; four independent and three state representatives &#x2013; was scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9 Ukrainian energy infrastructure struck for the third time in less than a month. On Dec. 13, Ukraine&#x2019;s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko reported that Russia had launched yet another massive missile and drone attack targeting energy facilities across Ukraine. This marked the third massive attack since November 2024 and twelfth since the beginning of the year, the Energy Ministry added. Russia&#x2019;s attack occurred during the afternoon of Dec. 12 and morning of Dec. 13, and was characterized by the use of combined weapons, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said. Russia launched an unprecedented 287 aerial weapons. Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses intercepted 81 missiles and 80 drones, while 105 drones failed to reach their targets. Later, Ukrenergo confirmed damage to energy facilities in several oblasts. As a result, the transmission system operator had to tighten the power outage schedules for the following days. Rinat Akhmetov&#x2019;s DTEK, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy holding, reported that Russia attacked its thermal power plants (TPPs) again, severely damaging equipment. This marked the ninth massive attack on its TPPs in 2024, DTEK added. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), five of Ukraine&#x2019;s nine operating nuclear reactor units reduced power output due to the attacks. From March 22 to Nov. 28, Ukraine faced nine massive missile and drone strikes on electricity facilities.&#x202F;See our Issues 124, 125, 127, 129, 131, 134, 145, 154, and 156 for more detail. Following each Russian attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s vital infrastructure, emergency outages occur, often lasting for days due to ongoing repair work. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks. The Hague court confirms that Russia must compensate Naftogaz for assets seized in Crimea. On Dec. 13, Naftogaz Group announced that the Supreme Court of the Netherlands dismissed Russia&#x2019;s cassation appeal, upholding the Partial Award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague concerning compensation for damages caused by the illegal expropriation of the Group&#x2019;s assets in Crimea. This ruling confirms for the second and final time the legality and validity of the Partial Award, Naftogaz explained. &#x201C;This decision strengthens Naftogaz Group&#x2019;s position in enforcement proceedings to recover compensation from Russia for the illegal seizure of assets in Crimea,&#x201D; Roman Chumak, Naftogaz&#x2019;s acting CEO said. As we wrote in April 2023, the Hague&#x2019;s Arbitration Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration ordered Russia to pay $5 billion to compensate Naftogaz for its losses in Crimea following the 2014 seizure of assets. See our Issue 83 for more detail. As we reported in November 2024, the Helsinki District Court froze Russian assets in Finland at Naftogaz&#x2019;s request. See Issue 154 for more detail. The Cabinet approved the terms of seized Motordetal-Konotop&#x2019;s privatisation. The starting price for the sale of the 100% stake is Hr 278.5 million ($6.6 million at the current exchange rate). All proceeds from this sale will go to the Fund for the Elimination of Consequences of Armed Aggression, part of the state budget. As we reported in Issue 149, on Sept. 26, the auction commission of the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) set the terms for the privatization of Motordetal-Konotop LLC, a plant confiscated earlier from sanctioned Russian senator Sergey Kalashnik. The company was transferred to the management of the SPFU by a ruling of the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) in 2023. Located in Sumy Oblast, Motordetal-Konotop is one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest producers of piston rings for internal combustion engines, the SPFU said. The company&#x2019;s clients include well-known car brands such as Rolls-Royce, Scania, MAN, Iveco, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Renault, and CAT. See our Issue 149 for more detail. HACC Appeals Chamber confirms the seizure of Ocean Plaza&#x2019;s debts to the Rotenbergs, paving the way for its privatization, the Justice Ministry announced on Dec. 12. According to the ministry, the claim rights of sanctioned Ethoder Investments Limited, a non-resident company related to the Rotenbergs, were seized in favor of the state, namely: The ruling comes into force immediately after its announcement and is not subject to appeal in cassation, the ministry noted. According to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP), in July 2023, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) seized 100% of the little-known Avangard-Vilarti LLC. The ultimate beneficial owners of this company were the children of Arkady Rotenberg, a sanctioned Russian oligarch close to Vladimir Putin. Avangard-Vilarti, now managed by the SPFU, owns 66.65% of Investment Union Lybid LLC (IU Lybid), which owns Kyiv&#x2019;s Ocean Plaza shopping mall. The remaining 33.35% in IU Lybid is owned by Andriy Ivanov&#x2019;s Lanita Invest LLC. Another company founded by Avangard-Vilarti is Ethoder Investments Limited, to which IU Lybid owes $177.4 million. It is because of this debt that Ocean Plaza has not yet been put up for privatization, the media explained. IU Lybid and Ethoder signed a loan agreement in 2009 for the construction of the Ocean Plaza shopping mall. The future asset was pledged as collateral to secure the agreement, EP said. According to the investors, UDP Holdings of Vasyl Khmelnytsky and Andriy Ivanov, and KAN Development of Igor Nikonov, the mall&#x2019;s construction cost was $300 million. It is unclear who owned Ethoder in 2009 when the loan agreement was signed. Nikonov said that the developers had attracted a &#x201C;pool of private investors.&quot; They sold the mall to the Rotenbergs in 2012 for $280-350 million. In 2019, Khmelnytsky bought back 33.35%, and in 2021, he allegedly resold this stake to Ivanov when they announced the separation of their businesses. IU Lybid stopped all payments on the loan in February 2022. The outstanding loan posed a problem for the SPFU and potential new owners, as the mall building itself served as a collateral, EP wrote in January 2024. According to EP, the SPFU and the Justice Ministry then had several options for solving this problem. Ultimately, they decided to clear the asset through the courts by imposing sanctions on the loan. As we wrote in Issue 106, the SPFU wants to sell the state&#x2019;s 66.65% stake in Ocean Plaza, previously owned by sanctioned Rotenbergs. As we wrote in April 2024 (Issue 127), the starting price was set at Hr 1.65 billion (39.2 million euros at the exchange rate at that time). See Issues 106, 109, 113, and 127 for more detail on Ocean Plaza&#x2019;s privatization.

Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 5	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 5 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Dec. 9-Dec. 15, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Tax committee approves bills extending tax benefits The Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy has recommended the adoption of two draft laws exempting certain imports and other operations from taxes and customs duties. Specifically, the proposed laws suggest: exempting components imported for the production of ammunition and shells as well as components for all types of drones from customs payments; extending tax benefits for the import of unmanned aerial vehicles, night vision devices, and anti-drone rifles; and introducing personal income tax exemptions for funds raised by volunteers for charitable foundations etc. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament, is scheduled to review these draft laws during its sessions on Dec. 17&#x2013;20. Parliament to consider draft law on High Administrative Court According to the agenda shared with MPs, this week the Verkhovna Rada is expected to discuss a draft law establishing a new High Administrative Court. However, the updated draft text has not yet been submitted to parliament. The deadline for this step, as stipulated in the IMF Memorandum, is the end of December. It&#x2019;s worth mentioning that the upcoming sessions of the parliamentary meetings from Dec. 17&#x2013;20 will be the last for the year. As noted in Issue 4, the Rada previously rejected three draft laws on the above-mentioned issue, as they were found to contradict Ukraine&#x2019;s commitments under the International Monetary Fund financial support program (EFF). The benchmark for canceling &apos;Lozovyy amendments&apos; is at risk of not being met on time In December, the deadline approaches for Ukraine to fulfill the IMF Memorandum requirement to amend the Criminal Procedure Code. These amendments have to enable the The Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor&apos;s Office to manage extradition and mutual legal assistance requests and rationalize consequences from expiration of time limits for pre-trial investigations cancelling so-called &#x201C;Lozovyy amendments.&quot; Currently, the structural benchmark is proposed to be addressed through amendments to another draft law, #10242. The bill is widely criticized by anti-corruption NGOs such as the Anti-corruption Action Center, Dejure Foundation, and Transparency International Ukraine for increasing the risks of criminal liability for investigative journalists. Given that the parliament will hold only one plenary week before the end of the year, there is a risk that the structural benchmark will not be met on time. Moreover, anti-corruption experts insist that the provision to transfer the authority to extend pre-trial investigations within a year from investigative judges to prosecutors must be incorporated into the draft law. Social Policy Ministry proposes pension reform draft law The Social Policy Ministry has unveiled a draft law on pension reform. The proposal includes updating the solidarity-based pension system by introducing a basic pension level, simplifying the calculation of current pensions insured by the state, and establishing a mandatory second-tier pension system based on accumulated savings. Before submission to Parliament, the draft law must receive approval from the Cabinet of Ministers.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-5/	2024-12-17T10:11:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2167201208-1.jpg
Who was Russian General Igor Kirillov, Ukraine’s latest assassination target?	Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov met his demise in Moscow on Dec. 17, reportedly killed by a bomb attached to a scooter planted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). &quot;Kirillov was a war criminal and a completely legitimate target, as he gave orders to use banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.&quot; Born on July 13, 1970, 54-year-old Kirillov was the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops (RKhBZ). According to the think tank and research group Global Security, the RKhBZ are ostensibly &quot;special troops designed to perform the most complex tasks of protecting troops and the population, requiring the use of special equipment.&quot; &quot;They consist of units and divisions for detecting nuclear explosions, radiation and chemical reconnaissance, special processing, aerosol countermeasures, flamethrower, etc,&quot; it adds. A Russian RS-24 Yars thermonuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile arrives for a military parade rehearsal ahead of Russia&apos;s Victory Day celebration in Moscow, Russia, on May 5, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)In Ukraine, Kirillov became best known for his alleged role in the use of chemical weapons by Russian forces against Ukrainian troops. Kirillov&apos;s involvement in chemical weapon attacks predates the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In 2018, Kirillov defended Moscow against accusations that Russia and Syria were tampering with evidence and blocking access to the site of a chemical weapons attack that killed more than 40 civilians in the Syrian town of Douma in 2018. A report from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons later found the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad had likely carried out the attack, despite Russia long-claiming otherwise, and spreading debunked conspiracy theories to try and shift blame away from their ally. Recent witness testimony provided in the wake of the fall of Assad provided further evidence that Syrian and Russian authorities lied and intimidated locals to try to suppress what actually happened. Moscow&apos;s forces have been increasingly deploying gas attacks against Ukrainian troops, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August found, and Kirillov has since been sanctioned by the U.K. for his role in their use. Ukrainian soldiers and officers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent acknowledged that the tactic is effective, allowing Moscow to capture positions occasionally without destroying them. According to an SBU investigation, chemical weapons have been used in more than 4,800 cases since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Since 2022, over 2,000 Ukrainian service members have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said earlier this week. &quot;Russian forces mostly use ammunition with toxic substances by dropping them from FPV (first-person-view) drones on Ukrainian positions. When chemical grenades are detonated, their poisonous compounds affect human mucous membranes, especially the eyes and respiratory tract,&quot; the SBU said. Earlier this year, the U.S. State Department confirmed that Russian forces had used the chemical agent chloropicrin in Ukraine. On Dec. 16, Kirillov was charged in absentia by the SBU for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. Kirillov was one of 123 &quot;elites and close associates of the (Russian) Regime&quot; sanctioned by the Canadian government in February 2023. And in October of this year, the U.K. issued sanctions against Russian units involved in the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. Kirillov along with two Russian Defense Ministry scientific centers were also on the list. &quot;The U.K. will not sit idly by whilst (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his mafia state ride roughshod over international law, including the Chemical Weapons Convention,&quot; British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement at the time. As well as his military endeavors, Kirillov was also a prominent mouthpiece for the Kremlin, and propagator of several debunked conspiracy theories. Shortly after the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Moscow&apos;s propaganda machine went into overdrive in an attempt to convince the world that Ukraine was hosting U.S.-funded bioweapons sites. There was no evidence to support the claims but that didn&apos;t stop the conspiracy theory gaining traction in the West, and even found supporters in the likes of Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump&apos;s pick for Director of National Intelligence. Kirillov played a central part in spreading disinformation, claiming to have documents obtained on the first day of the full-scale invasion that showed &quot;the Ministry of Health of Ukraine has set the task of completely destroying bio-agents in laboratories.&quot; &quot;The Pentagon knows that if these documents fall into the hands of Russian experts, then it&apos;s highly likely that Ukraine and the United States will be found to have violated the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons,&quot; Kirillov added. The World Health Organization (WHO) clarified that Ukraine had been advised to destroy high-threat pathogens in labs in order to &quot;any potential spills,&quot; but stressed this was related to routine scientific research and not biological weapons. Later in 2022, Kirillov was also instrumental in spreading false claims that Ukraine was developing a &quot;dirty bomb,&quot; a crude nuclear device designed to contaminate a wide area with radiation, making it inhabitable. &quot;According to the information we have, two organisations in Ukraine have specific instructions to create a so-called &apos;dirty bomb&apos;. This work is in its final stage,&quot; he said in October 2022. He provided no evidence to back up the claim and none has come to light since. Kirillov and another Russian service member were reportedly killed in an explosion on the morning of Dec. 17 in Moscow. The explosion occurred at around 6 a.m. local time when a service car arrived for Kirillov, the Mash Telegram channel reported.

(Alexander Nemenov / AFP via Getty Images)Russian state media outlet Kommersant said the two men were killed by a homemade explosive device that contained the equivalent of around 300 grams of TNT. An SBU source later told the Kyiv Independent it was responsible for the killing, and that explosives attached to a scooter detonated when the pair left the entrance of a house on Ryazansky Prospect in the capital. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has begun a terrorism investigation into the case, and two undisclosed sources told the Russian RBC news agency that investigators consider Ukraine&apos;s involvement the most likely scenario.	https://kyivindependent.com/profile-russian-lieutenant-general-igor-kirillov-war-criminal-and-ukrainian-assassination-target/	2024-12-17T09:56:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2189820966.jpg
Zelensky rejects Orban's mediation, says he has no leverage over Putin	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has no leverage over Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine does not need his mediation in potential peace talks, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 17. &#x201C;Ukraine is a strong country and has proven it on the battlefield throughout Putin&apos;s aggression. Does anyone else in Europe have this experience now? No. Does Orban have such an army? No. How will he put pressure on Putin? With a joke, a smile? Let him keep it,&#x201D; Zelensky said, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. Hungary has maintained close ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, frequently criticizing EU sanctions on Russia and blocking military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said that Ukraine needs direct relations with the United States, rejecting Orban&apos;s role as an intermediary. &#x201C;Prime Minister Orban... will not succeed. I won&#x2019;t let him or people like him in,&#x201D; he said, clarifying that his remarks were directed at Orban, not the Hungarian people, who he argued overwhelmingly support Ukraine. Zelensky&#x2019;s comments followed escalating tensions after Orban&#x2019;s recent phone call with Putin and his criticism of Zelensky for allegedly rejecting a Christmas ceasefire proposal. Ukrainian officials have dismissed these claims, emphasizing their focus on achieving a just peace through strength. &#x201C;Negotiations on a sustainable peace will begin only when the enemy does not have the resources to continue the war,&#x201D; Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak said on Dec. 17, adding that Ukraine&#x2019;s victory plan was created to bolster its position.	https://kyivindependent.com/keep-the-jokes-zelensky-criticizes-orbans-attempts-at-mediation/	2024-12-17T09:40:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2159697231.jpg
Ukraine sets goal to open all EU negotiation clusters in 2025, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 17 that Ukraine aims to open all negotiating clusters with the European Union in 2025, an ambitious step in the country&#x2019;s EU accession process, Interfax-Ukraine reported. &#x201C;During Poland&#x2019;s EU presidency, we expect to open at least two clusters and six in total. To be honest, our goal is very ambitious &#x2014; to open all the clusters next year,&#x201D; Zelensky said at the All-Ukrainian Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. The EU&#x2019;s Commissioner for Enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, has said Ukraine could join the bloc by 2029, provided it completes the necessary reforms. Ukraine submitted its detailed reform plan on March 20, outlining its vision for reconstruction and modernization as part of its EU membership aspirations. The European Commission recently commended Ukraine&#x2019;s progress in key areas, including the rule of law, judicial reform, and anti-corruption measures. However, it emphasized that additional reforms are needed to meet EU standards. Ukraine received EU candidate status in June 2022. The European Commission recommended launching accession talks with Ukraine in November 2023, and the European Council approved the decision a month later.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-sets-goal-to-open-all-eu-negotiation-clusters-by-2025-zelensky-says/	2024-12-17T08:27:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389-1.jpg
MP expelled from Zelensky's party faces trial on charges of assaulting war veteran	The assault and kidnapping case against Mykola Tyshchenko, an MP who was expelled from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party in 2023, has been sent to trial, the State Investigation Bureau said on Dec. 17. The bureau said it had completed the investigation against Tyshchenko on charges of illegally detaining and assaulting a war veteran in Dnipro. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison. The charges stem from a widely circulated video recorded in June showing Tyshchenko and his bodyguards confronting veteran Dmytro Pavlov, who was walking with his child in central Dnipro. The footage shows an argument escalating into a physical altercation, with Pavlov reportedly detained and sustaining injuries. Tyshchenko, who later admitted to being in Dnipro during the incident, claimed he was investigating alleged bot farms. The incident drew significant backlash from activists, soldiers, and public officials. Zelensky&apos;s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak condemned Tyshchenko&apos;s actions, calling them &#x201C;absolutely disgraceful.&#x201D; Yermak also noted his long-standing acquaintance with Tyshchenko, who had previously christened Yermak&apos;s son. Tyshchenko has a history of controversy, including his expulsion from Zelensky&#x2019;s Servant of the People party in January 2023 after an unauthorized wartime trip to Thailand.

Deals over ideals — Anne Applebaum explains the playbook of autocracies in new book, and how to undermine them	Autocratic regimes like Russia are becoming increasingly bold in their efforts to undermine the principles and norms that came to define the democratic world order in the aftermath of World War II. A month after the start of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov even declared &#x201C;this is not about Ukraine at all, but the world order.&#x201D; &#x201C;The current (war) is a fateful, epoch-making moment in modern history,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;It reflects the battle over what the world order will look like.&#x201D; As Ukraine&apos;s Western allies grapple with how far they can go in supporting the embattled country against a war of total annihilation, Russia&apos;s intent reveals not only a profound contempt for the Ukrainian people, their history, and culture but also a broader aspiration to reshape the world into a landscape marked by the erosion of individual freedoms and consolidation of power at the top. In her latest book, &#x201C;Autocracy, Inc.,&#x201D; U.S. journalist and historian Anne Applebaum delves into the intricate web of financial, technological, and police networks that autocracies such as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran have cultivated to bolster one another. She examines how these regimes, in some instances, have begun to operate as if with complete impunity, disregarding international condemnation and withstanding the impact of severe economic sanctions. The autocratic leaders of today, Applebaum argues, are not driven by spreading ideologies of the past such as communism or fascism. They &#x201C;share a determination to deprive their citizens of any real influence or public voice, to push back against all forms of transparency or accountability, and to repress anyone, at home or abroad, who challenges them.&#x201D; The historian and journalist Anne Applebaum participates in the session &#x2018;Democracies in danger&#x2019; in the XXXV Economy Circle meeting in Barcelona, Spain on May 30, 2019. (David Zorrakino/Europa Press via Getty Images)The alliances between these countries are forged through &quot;deals, not ideals,&quot; enabling them to sidestep the burden of Western financial sanctions that many face. The arrangements between these countries frequently involve the exchange of surveillance technology to bolster internal control over their populations or the mutual enrichment of the considerable wealth they have accumulated. Belarus is one of the more striking examples cited by Applebaum. Despite widespread unpopularity among the Belarusian population and condemnation from international bodies like the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has managed to remain in power for the past three decades. The relatively small country is not as isolated as it may seem, nor is it facing a major economic crisis. Belarusian goods are barred from the EU market due to sanctions, and its national airline, Belavia, is prohibited from flying to European destinations. However, as Applebaum notes, Belarus has found alternative economic partners. &#x201C;More than two dozen&#x201D; Chinese companies have invested in its economy, while Russia has long provided the country with a crucial financial lifeline. The relationship between Belarus and Russia is deeply interdependent. When some Belarusian journalists refused to cover up Lukashenko&#x2019;s widespread election fraud during the 2020 presidential election, for example, Russian state-affiliated media sent their own journalists to take their place. Since the onset of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Belarus has effectively served as both a military base for Russian troops and a launchpad for attacks on Ukrainian territory. As autocratic regimes seek out like-minded allies to forge an alternative to the democratic world order, we are witnessing a number of troubling trends, such as the targeting of dissidents abroad. This alarming strategy sends a clear message &#x2014; that these regimes believe they are on the advance and nothing can stop them. According to Applebaum, &#x201C;the conviction, common among the most committed autocrats, that the outside world cannot touch them &#x2013; that the views of other nations don&#x2019;t matter and that no court of public opinion will ever judge them &#x2013; is (a) relatively recent (phenomenon).&#x201D; One disturbing example is the kidnapping of Belarusian opposition journalist Roman Protasevich from a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius in 2021. When the plane crossed through Belarusian airspace, Belarusian air traffic falsely told the pilots of the Irish-owned airline that a bomb was on board. MiG fighter jets were dispatched to force a landing in Minsk, the country&#x2019;s capital, and Protasevich and his girlfriend were taken off the flight. Applebaum describes the incident as having &#x201C;no exact precedent,&#x201D; shattering the illusion that individuals in the democratic world are insulated from autocratic threats. Protasevich&#x2019;s kidnapping ultimately challenged the belief that democratic systems can &#x201C;protect anyone who lives in them from the lawlessness that prevails in (countries like) Russia or Cuba.&#x201D; Autocracies &#x201C;keep track of one another&#x2019;s defeats and victories, timing their own moves to create maximum chaos,&#x201D; explains Applebaum. In the fall of 2023, Applebaum writes, amid the bolstered discourse of &#x201C;Ukraine fatigue,&#x201D; the long-standing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia reignited as Azerbaijan launched a military offensive on Nagorno-Karabakh, which had already been under a blockade for the past year. In the Middle East, Iranian-backed Hamas militants perpetrated a terrorist attack against Israel that resulted in over 1,000 fatalities and started a new escalation that killed 45,000 people in Palestine. Numerous other conflicts have flared up since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine nearly three years ago. As Applebaum notes, &#x201C;this multifaceted, interconnected, self-reinforcing polycrisis was not coordinated by a single mastermind, and it is not evidence of a secret conspiracy. Instead, these episodes, taken together, demonstrate how different autocracies have extended their influence across different political, economic, military, and informational spheres.&#x201D; Meanwhile, autocracies exploit loopholes in the financial systems of democratic countries, benefiting financially from the very countries they are working to undermine. Autocracies also continue to infiltrate information spaces within democratic societies, aiming to sow seeds of doubt and discord. This includes the &#x201C;fantastical tales of biological warfare (that) began to surge across the internet&#x201D; following Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. The Russian Defense and Foreign Ministries alleged that the U.S. had funded laboratories in Ukraine where experiments on viruses were purportedly being conducted. Although these claims were easily debunked, they proliferated rapidly on platforms like X and formerly Twitter and also gained traction elsewhere, such as in Chinese state media. &#x201C;China had a clear interest in this story, since it muddied recent history and helped relieve China of the need to investigate its own hazardous biolabs, including the one in Wuhan that might have been the true source of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#x201D; Applebaum explains. Even some independent news sites have amplified blatant disinformation. However, as Applebaum explains, many operate as &quot;information laundromats,&quot; disguising themselves as media outlets when their purpose is to disseminate Russian talking points. Readers may find themselves overwhelmed while reading &#x201C;Autocracy, Inc.&#x201D; &#x2014; and justifiably so. In her 2021 article for The Atlantic which partly inspired this book, Applebaum didn&#x2019;t mince words, warning that &#x201C;the bad guys are winning.&#x201D; She paints a grim picture of a possible future where international human rights are no longer guaranteed, and global conflict becomes the norm. At the same time, Applebaum points out that democracies cannot completely sever ties with these autocratic regimes, as cooperation will still be necessary on critical issues like climate change.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Yet, despite these challenges, Applebaum maintains an optimistic outlook and advocates for strategies to confront and counter the rise of global autocracy. These solutions are far from simple &#x2013; if they were, notes Applebaum, they would have been implemented long ago. Applebaum proposes that the solutions she lays out in the book be taken on by coalitions of countries that can be more effective in achieving goals such as working toward eliminating any loopholes that allow for money laundering and dark money. She also calls for undermining the information war rather than engaging in direct confrontation. A key part of this strategy is ensuring the information system &#x2014; given its power over public perception &#x2014; functions under strong laws and regulations, similar to the financial system. &#x201C;Since we first encountered Russian disinformation inside our own societies,&#x201D; Applebaum writes, &#x201C;we&#x2019;ve imagined that our existing forms of communication could beat it without any special effort. But no one who studies autocratic propaganda believes that fact-checking or even swift reactions are sufficient. By the time the correction is made, the falsehood has already traveled around the world.&#x201D; Applebaum also warns against relying too heavily on trade with autocratic countries like Russia and China, calling it an &quot;existential&quot; threat. She recalls Europe&#x2019;s dependence on Russian gas and explains how after Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, the switch to more expensive energy sources triggered inflation. Russia then amplified the crisis through the spread of disinformation, fueling support for far-right movements in countries like Germany. For those living comfortably in democratic societies, the dangers posed by countries like Russia might feel distant. However, North Korean troops supporting Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as Iranian drones and missiles with China-supplied components being used to attack Ukrainian infrastructure underscore how this war is not some isolated event. Ukraine&apos;s struggle is not just a fight against Russia &#x2014; it is emblematic of a larger battle for global democratic values, serving as a wake-up call for the world. As complacency risks setting in among democratic nations, the price of inaction might grow ever steeper. Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this article.

UK sanctions 20 Russian 'shadow fleet' tankers, announces financial aid to Ukraine	The United Kingdom sanctioned 20 vessels of Russia&#x2019;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; and pledged 35 million pounds ($44 million) in aid to repair Ukraine&#x2019;s energy grid, the British government said on Dec. 17. Russia&apos;s shadow fleet is composed of semi-legal cargo ships transporting Russian products around the globe in violation of international sanctions. The U.K. sanctions follow similar restrictions imposed by the EU, which recently banned 52 vessels transporting Russian oil above the $60-per-barrel price cap from accessing EU ports and services According to estimates, 70% of Russia&#x2019;s seaborne oil exports are transported by such old and poorly insured tankers, fuelling the Kremlin&#x2019;s war chest and posing a grave danger to the environment. This was exemplified by two tankers reportedly going under due to severe weather conditions in December in the Kerch Strait, carrying approximately 4,000 tons of fuel oil on board each. The Ocean Faye, Andaman Skies, and Mianzimu are among the 20 newly sanctioned ships, the British government said. Each will have carried more than 4 million barrels of Russian oil by the end of 2024. With the latest measures, the U.K. has sanctioned over 100 ships for transporting Russian energy, 93 of which are oil tankers. &quot;As (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s oil revenues continue to fuel the fires of his illegal war, Ukrainian families are enduring cold, dark nights, often without heating, light or electricity, targeted by Russia&apos;s relentless missile attacks,&quot; British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. The newly pledged 35 million pounds will be used to &quot; carry out vital repairs to the electricity transmission network and provide further power generation capacity and critical protection for energy infrastructure,&#x201D; the statement read. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine&apos;s power grid with mass drone and missile attacks, most recently on Dec. 13, heavily damaging energy infrastructure as the winter sets in.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-sanctions-20-russian-shadow-fleet-tankers/	2024-12-17T05:58:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160310001.jpg
Russian forces heavily attacking in Kursk Oblast for 3rd day, Syrskyi says	Russian forces are carrying out an intensive offensive in Kursk Oblast for the third day in a row, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Dec. 17, as Ukrainian forces are on the defensive in the border region. &quot;For the third day, Russian forces have been conducting intensive offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, actively using North Korean units,&quot; Syrskyi said in an online address to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities held in Lviv. Russia reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. &quot;North Korean mercenaries have already suffered heavy losses,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s commander said, adding that Kyiv&apos;s troops are holding the defenses, destroying enemy personnel and equipment. The Special Operation Forces said that they had killed 50 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast in three days and injured 47 more. The full extent of North Korean losses is hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Despite the losses within Russian and North Korean ranks, the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Kursk Oblast seem to be increasingly on the back foot, facing a Russian advantage in manpower and equipment. Citing Ukrainian soldiers, The Economist wrote that Ukraine likely lost around half of the territory it had captured in the initial phase of the operation in August and September. An officer talking to the outlet connected this development to the redeployment of elite units that first spearheaded the offensive. Ukraine likely seeks to hold on to a piece of Russian territory as a possible bargaining chip ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s expected push for peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-attacking-in-kursk-oblast-for-3rd-day/	2024-12-17T05:30:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
Ukraine's parliament supports bill on multiple citizenship in first reading	The Ukrainian parliament on Dec. 17 supported in the first reading a bill allowing multiple citizenship for Ukrainian citizens, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. The Ukrainian law currently specifies that Ukrainians can hold only a single citizenship, while multiple citizenship is not recognized. President Volodymyr Zelensky submitted the bill legalizing multiple citizenship in August and stressed its importance as part of his internal resilience plan in November. The bill, supported by 247 lawmakers in the first reading, still has to pass a second reading and be signed by the president before becoming law. The parliament also asked the Constitutional Court to review the document. The legislation lists permissible cases for holding multiple citizenship, simplifies procedures for foreigners to obtain Ukrainian citizenship, and establishes new grounds for losing citizenship, such as receiving a Russian passport or serving in the Russian Armed Forces. The bill is also seen as part of Ukraine&apos;s effort to strengthen ties with the Ukrainians living abroad. Zelensky said the document should allow ethnic Ukrainians born abroad to obtain citizenship. Even before the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian diaspora has been widespread around the world, with particularly large communities in the EU, the U.S., and Canada. The war drew millions more from their home, with some 6.7 million living as refugees abroad as of August 2024. To foster the relationship with the Ukrainian community abroad, the government launched a new department called the National Unity Ministry, headed by former Naftogaz chief Oleksii Chernyshov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parliament-supports-bill-on-multiple-citizenship-in-first-reading/	2024-12-17T04:40:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167567610.jpg
Slovak energy company, partners call for continued gas transit via Ukraine	Slovakia&apos;s state-owned energy company SPP and its partners in Hungary, Italy, and Austria called for continued gas transit through Ukraine in a declearation published on Dec. 17. The deal under which Russian gas transits to the EU via Ukrainian territory is set to expire on Dec. 31. Kyiv said it has no intention of prolonging the deal as Moscow continues to wage its all-out war. &quot;The declaration, drafted by the SPP, is meant to support the continuation of gas transit through Ukrainian territory and to sustain its gas infrastructure since it is the most advantageous solution not only for European buyers but for Ukraine itself,&quot; the company said in a statement. The document will be presented to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen so that she can receive &quot;first-hand information about the threat to the energy and economic security in our region,&quot; the statement read. SPP chairman Vojtech Ferencz said that replacing the entire volume of gas transiting from Ukraine would cost the company an additional 150 million euros ($157 million). Cutting the transit will also increase gas prices ahead of the coming winter and can reduce profits of SPP&apos;s subsidiary Eustream, which cooperates with Ukrainian gas companies, Ferencz added. Despite Europe&apos;s efforts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels in the wake of a full-scale invasion, many countries remain heavily dependent on Russian gas, with Slovakia, Hungary, and Austria among the main buyers. Only in June this year did the EU approve sanctions against the Russian gas industry, targeting liquefied natural gas (LNG) rather than pipeline gas. Following discussions with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, his Ukrainian counterpart Denys Shmyhal said Kyiv is open to negotiating gas transit for any origin except Russian. &quot;To this effect, if the European Commission officially approaches Ukraine about the transit of any gas other than Russian, we naturally will discuss it and are ready to reach an appropriate agreement,&quot; Shmyhal noted in a statement. Fico, ahead of his talks with Shmyhal, emphasized that maintaining gas transit is not solely a bilateral concern for Ukraine&#x2019;s neighbors but an issue affecting the entire European Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-energy-company-partners-call-for-continued-gas-transit-via-ukraine/	2024-12-17T04:00:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1247343791.jpg
Latvia announces surprise combat readiness check of its military	Latvia&apos;s Armed Forces on Dec. 17 announced snap military exercises across the country &quot;to test and improve procedures and units&apos; combat readiness.&quot; While the Latvian Defense Ministry said that the drills are &quot;not related to changes in the security environment,&quot; the exercises take place amid surging tensions between NATO and Russia. The partial test will consist of moving units across Latvia to different sites where they will perform assigned tasks. &#x1F4E2; &#x160;odien, 17. decembr&#x12B;, vis&#x101; Latvij&#x101; notiek Nacion&#x101;lo bru&#x146;oto sp&#x113;ku vien&#x12B;bu kaujas gatav&#x12B;bas p&#x101;rbaude.

Latvia, a NATO member country of 1.8 million with a sizeable Russian minority, borders Russia and its key ally in the region, Belarus. One of Ukraine&#x2019;s biggest supporters, Riga has committed to providing military support at the level of 0.25% of its GDP every year and will provide thousands of drones. Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have been raising alarm about a growing Russian threat to the Baltic region and the alliance as a whole. As they prepare for possible conflict, the three nations agreed to build a Baltic defense line in the coming years to strengthen the eastern border with Belarus and Russia. Lithuania, another Baltic state bordering Russia&#x2019;s Kaliningrad enclave, has blocked and fortified a bridge over the Nieman River, linking it to the Russian exclave. The country has also drafted plans to relocate a quarter of its population in the case of war. In light of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, civil preparedness measures have been under review also in Latvia and Estonia.	https://kyivindependent.com/latvia-announces-surprise-combat-readiness-check/	2024-12-17T02:57:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/465153903_985283550296698_6057308511895131157_n.jpg
Ukraine's Special Forces claim to kill 50 North Korean soldiers in 3 days	Ukraine&apos;s Special Operations Forces killed 50 North Korean soldiers and injured 47 others in three days of fighting in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the unit said on Dec. 17. The Special Operation Forces published footage of first-person-view (FPV) drones successfully targeting soldiers and equipment on the battlefield. Russia has reportedly deployed over 10,000 North Korean troops to help oust Ukrainian troops fighting in Kursk Oblast since early August. &quot;Soldiers of the 8th Special Forces Regiment of Prince Izyaslav Mstislavich organized a warm welcome for North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast,&quot; the unit said on Facebook. Two armored vehicles, two cars, and one all-terrain vehicle were also allegedly hit. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. After reporting initial but limited clashes with North Korean troops in November, Ukraine said that over the weekend, Russia also began using the soldiers in ground assaults. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency (HUR) said that 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or injured during assaults on Dec. 14-15. The full extent of North Korean losses might be hard to ascertain, as President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is trying to hide the casualties. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean personnel had engaged in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and suffered their first casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-special-forces-claim-to-kill-50-north-korean-soldiers-in-3-days/	2024-12-17T02:30:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/SOF.png
South Korea imposes new sanctions over Russia-North Korea cooperation	South Korea imposed sanctions on 11 individuals and 15 entities &quot;engaged in illegal military cooperation between Russia and North Korea,&quot; the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Dec. 17. The sanctions will enter into force by Dec. 19. Among the sanctioned individuals are high-ranking North Korean military officers deployed to Russia and a senior missile engineer in the North Korean army, as well as an elite unit called &quot;Storm Corps&quot; and their commander, also deployed to Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. Ukrainian and Western officials issued warnings in the fall of 2024 that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces after Kyiv launched a surprise incursion in the region in August. The sanctions list further includes seven Russian individuals and 13 organizations, including several banks. Seoul accused them of facilitating arms trade between Russia and North Korea, supplying the Russian military with North Korean telecommunications equipment, and helping North Korea&apos;s nuclear and missile program. The sanctions mean that financial transactions with these entities will require Seoul&#x2019;s prior approval. South Korea has committed economic and humanitarian support to Ukraine, recently providing a $100 million loan to help keep Kyiv&apos;s budget afloat. Seoul has not supplied Ukraine with direct lethal support, a step prohibited by the country&apos;s legislation. A Ukrainian delegation to the East Asian country met with the now-impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has signaled the possibility of providing military aid to Ukraine in light of growing cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. In a recent video address, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that North Koreans were participating in Russian assaults in the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence has claimed that at least 30 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded on the Kursk front.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-imposes-sanctions-over-russia-north-korea-cooperation/	2024-12-17T02:01:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1238947016.jpg
Ukraine 'strongly condemns' African delegation's visit to Russian-occupied territories	The Foreign Ministry on Dec. 16 condemned the visit of the Pan-African Parliament&apos;s delegation to Ukraine&apos;s Russian-occupied territories. Representatives from a dozen African countries arrived in Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk Oblast earlier in December &quot;to find out the truth of the Russian people.&quot; Their statements, quoted by the Russian state media, parroted Kremlin propaganda lines about the West&#x2019;s proxy war against Russia and the &quot;brotherhood&quot; of the Russian-Ukrainian nations. &quot;Their statements during this visit about opposing colonialism, made on Ukrainian land illegally seized by Russia in the course of its neocolonial war of aggression against Ukraine, are completely absurd,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry strongly protests the visit of the delegation of the Pan-African Parliament.&quot; The Pan-African Parliament is the legislative body of the African Union, a 55-member strong international organization of the African continent. Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion and the blockade of its Black Sea ports threatened imminent famine in developing countries, including much of Africa, until a trade corridor agreement was reached, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Russia announced in 2023 that it was withdrawing from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, critical for ensuring global food security, effectively collapsing the deal. Subsequently, Ukraine opened a new corridor, restoring its exports via the Black Sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-condemns-african-delegations-visit-to-russian-occupied-territories/	2024-12-17T01:18:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1983501762.jpg

SBU behind killing of Russian general charged with chemical weapons crimes, source claims	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, was killed on Dec. 17 in an operation of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. Kirillov and another Russian service member were reportedly killed in an explosion earlier the same day at a residence in Moscow. Ukraine previously charged the commander with using banned chemical weapons in the war against Ukraine. According to the source, explosives attached to a scooter detonated when Kirillov and his aide approached the entrance of the house on Ryazansky Prospect in Moscow.

Defense Ministry to investigate alleged abuse of service members in 211th Brigade	Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on Dec. 16 ordered an investigation into the alleged abuse, extortion, and humiliation of soldiers in the 211th Pontoon Bridge Brigade by their commanders. The announcement comes after Ukrainska Pravda reported that the unit&apos;s officers have beaten service members, extorted money from them, and even tied one soldier to a wooden cross as a punishment. Umerov ordered the ministry&apos;s main inspectorate to investigate Ukrainska Pravda&apos;s revelations, adding that such behavior would be &quot;unacceptable in the third year of the war.&quot; &quot;My position as a minister is clear: all those responsible must be punished.&quot; Defense Ministry spokesperson Dmytro Lazutkin said that the department had not received any reports of abuse of soldiers in the brigade. He described the commanders&apos; alleged behavior as &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;contradicting the basic principles of building a modern Ukrainian army.&quot; At the same time, Lazutkin said these cases do not happen on a &quot;massive&quot; scale. &quot;The Ukrainian military consists of over a million service members. Various cases happen. We had no information about these cases,&quot; Lazutkin told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In response to the media investigation, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi also ordered an inspection and suspended Colonel Oleh Poberezhniuk, the brigade commander. The 211th Brigade, formed in August 2023, performs engineering work, builds defenses in the rear, and does not participate in direct combat. According to Ukrainska Pravda, the cases of abuse surfaced after the start of official checks in the spring of 2024. The outlet&apos;s sources named now-Captain Vladyslav Pastukh, Poborezhniuk&apos;s godson and the son of the unit&apos;s chief of staff, as one of the main perpetrators. The officer was said to have extorted money from soldiers on account of being related to the unit&apos;s most senior officers. Though Pastukh no longer serves in the unit, the media investigation identified almost a dozen cases of fathers and sons or husbands and wives serving together in the 211th Brigade. The revelations come as Ukraine faces mounting challenges in replenishing the ranks of its Armed Forces, facing low enlistment rates and even cases of desertion. Mykhailo Drapatyi, the new commander of the Ground Forces, recently announced wide-ranging reforms focusing on recruitment and training.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-addresses-alleged-abuse-in-211th-brigade/	2024-12-16T23:29:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1620354990.jpg

Russian general charged with chemical weapons crimes reported dead in Moscow explosion	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, was reportedly killed in an explosion at a residence in Moscow the morning of Dec. 17, according to Russian media. Ukraine&apos;s Security Service (SBU) on Dec. 16 sentenced Kirillov in absentia for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine. Kirillov and another Russian servicemember, reported to be his personal assistant, were killed in an explosion near the entrance to a residential building in Moscow in the early hours of Dec. 17, according to the Russian Telegram news channel Astra. Russia&apos;s Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case on the incident. The committee reported that the explosion was caused by a device planted on a scooter near the entrance to the building. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these reports. The SBU alleged on Dec. 16 that Kirillov was responsible for &quot;the massive use of banned chemical weapons&quot; against the Ukrainian military. &quot;On Kirillov&apos;s orders, since the beginning of the full-scale war, more than 4,800 cases of enemy use of chemical munitions have been recorded,&quot; the SBU claimed. The U.K. issued sanctions against Kirillov and his unit over the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine on Oct. 8. Ukraine has previously targeted Russian officials who play a key role in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. &#xA0; Mikhail Shatsky, a Russian expert involved in modernizing missiles launched against Ukraine, was shot dead near Moscow on Dec. 12, a Defense Forces source told the Kyiv Independent. Aleksey Kolomeitsev, a Russian colonel who trained specialists in the use of attack drones, was killed in the city of Kolomna in Moscow Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 28.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-general-killed-in-moscow-explosion-local-media-reports/	2024-12-16T21:46:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/kirillov-3.jpg
West should pressure Russia into peace talks, not Ukraine, Polish FM says	Western nations should push Russia, not Ukraine, into peace negotiations to stop the war, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at a press conference in Brussels on Dec. 16. Sikorski&apos;s comments come as Europe braces for a withdrawal of U.S. support once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. Trump has promised to accelerate negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. As the aggressor in the conflict, Russia should be the one facing pressure to negotiate, Sikorski said. &quot;Both the United States and the European Union must help Ukraine to achieve a better negotiating position for possible future negotiations, which should be encouraged and forced on the aggressor, not the victim,&quot; he said. Sikorski called on Europe and its allies to form a united front against Russia, and said the E.U. should become more &quot;tense&quot; in its response to Russian aggression. Ukraine&apos;s allies have doubled down on economic and military support for Kyiv in attempts to strengthen the war-torn nation&apos;s hand before any potential peace talks. The E.U on Dec. 16 adopted its 15th sanctions package against Moscow, targeting Russia&apos;s shadow fleet and defense sector. Before the package was announced, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha updated his European counterparts, including Sikorski, on the situation in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-fm-sikorski-calls-for-western-pressure-on-russia-to-end-war/	2024-12-16T21:10:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/sikorski-2-1.jpg
North Korean soldiers 'legitimate targets' for Ukrainian military, US official says	North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast are already &quot;legitimate targets&quot; for the Ukrainian military, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Dec. 16. The remarks came the same day that the Pentagon confirmed the first North Korean casualties in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;North Korean soldiers who were deployed to Kursk are already legitimate targets,&quot; Miller told reporters during a press briefing. &#xA0; &quot;They entered a war, and they are, as such, combatants and are legitimate targets for the Ukrainian military. &#xA0;We have seen North Korean soldiers who have been killed in action on the battlefield inside Russia.&quot; Miller warned that if North Korean personnel crossed the border from Russia into Ukraine and engaged in combat, the U.S. would consider it a significant escalation in the war. &quot;And if they were to cross the border into Ukraine, that would be yet another escalation by the Government of Russia and also an escalation by the Government of North Korea ... That would absolutely be an escalation,&quot; he said. Miller declined to say what the U.S. response would be to such an escalation by Moscow and Pyongyang. &quot;I&apos;m not going to preview that publicly,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on Dec. 14 that North Koreans had begun engaging in assault operations with Russian troops fighting aginst Ukraine in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine and the U.S. had sounded the alarm on the deployment of North Korean soldiers in the region for months prior. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) said on Dec. 16 that at least 30 North Korean personnel had been killed or wounded in assaults in Kursk. Zelensky then alleged that Russia has gone to great lengths to hide North Korean losses, including burning soldiers&apos; bodies. Thus far, North Korean units have only been deployed in Kursk Oblast, the Russian border region that Ukrainian troops attacked in a shock offensive in August. North Korean troops have not yet engaged in combat on the Ukrainian side of the border. Russia and North Korea have deepened their economic and military ties since the full-scale invasion of February 2022. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-legitimate-targets-for-ukrainian-military-us-official-says/	2024-12-16T20:33:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2155312256.jpg
Russia to mass-produce Oreshnik ballistic missiles, Putin claims	Russia plans to begin mass production of its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), Russian President Vladimir Putin alleged at a defense ministry board meeting on Dec. 16. Russia first launched the experimental Oreshnik missile in an attack against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Putin claimed the strike was a response to Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. and British long-range missiles to attack Russian territory. Putin said on Dec. 16 that large-scale Oreshnik production was a goal for the &quot;near future.&quot; &quot;In the near future, serial production of such systems should be ensured to protect the security of Russia and our allies,&quot; he said. A former Russian defense engineer previously told the Moscow Times that mass production of Oreshnik missiles would take years, due to bureaucratic and technological difficulties in Russia. The Oreshnik is an IRBM capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Putin has boasted that the missile travels at 10 times the speed of sound. He has also alleged that the weapon cannot be intercepted by air defense systems, a claim refuted by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Kremlin has leveraged possession of Oreshnik missiles in escalating anti-Western rhetoric and threats against Ukraine. A week after the strike on Dnipro, Putin on Nov. 28 threatened to target &quot;decision-making centers in Kyiv&quot; with Oreshnik strikes. An unnamed U.S. National Security Council representative warned on Dec. 13 that Russia was considering launching an Oreshnik missile at Ukraine over the upcoming weekend. No such attack took place. The intense media attention devoted to the Oreshnik in the aftermath of the Dnipro strike was the result of an orchestrated Russian attempt to stir panic in the West, four Russian officials told the Moscow Times in early December. Some defense experts say the Oreshnik missile is likely not an entirely new development, but rather an upgraded version of Russia&apos;s RS-26 missile. The RS-26, also known as the Rubezh, was first produced in 2011. Russia has yet to use the Oreshnik in any attacks against Ukraine since the strike on Nov. 21. &#xA0; &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-announces-mass-production-of-oreshnik-missiles/	2024-12-16T19:23:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185738307.jpg
Russia trying to hide North Korean losses in Ukraine war, Zelensky claims	The Russian military is attempting to hide the losses of North Korean soldiers fighting in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed on Dec. 16. Zelensky&apos;s remarks came after Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) and the U.S. Pentagon on Dec. 16 reported that North Korean troops suffered casualties in assault operations alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Russia is not only involving North Korean soldiers in assaults on Ukrainian positions, but is also trying to hide the losses of these people,&quot; Zelensky said via his official Telegram channel. The Russian military has attempted to keep the presence of North Korean units secret throughout their training and deployment, Zelensky said. He also claimed that Moscow has resorted to extreme tactics to disguise the identities of North Korean soldiers killed in combat. Russia tries to &quot;burn the faces&quot; of North Korean soldiers after they are killed, Zelensky alleged. His post shared a video purportedly showing Russian personnel setting fire to the bodies of North Korean fighters on the front line. The Kyiv Independent could not confirm Zelensky&apos;s claim or the veracity of the video. &quot;There is no reason for Koreans to fight and die for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And even after their deaths, all that awaits them from Russia is mockery.&quot; Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder confirmed on Dec. 16 that North Korean personnel had engaged in combat operations alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast and suffered their first casualties. The confirmation came after Zelensky reported on Dec. 14 that North Koreans were participating in Russian assaults in the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence has claimed that at least 30 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded on the Kursk front. Ukrainian and Western officials issued warnings in fall 2024 that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces after Kyiv launched a surprise incursion in the region in August. The first clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. Zelensky and Western officials have accused Russia of dramatically escalating the war against Ukraine by involving a foreign state in the conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-trying-to-hide-north-korean-losses-zelensky-claims/	2024-12-16T17:54:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187689001.jpg
Russian gas transit deal ends on December 31, won't be renewed, PM Shmyhal says	Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Dec. 16 that the deal allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine will not be extended beyond the end of the year. His statement comes as several European countries intensify efforts to secure alternative energy supplies. Following discussions with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, Shmyhal said Ukraine is open to negotiating gas transit for any origin except Russian. &quot;To this effect, if the European Commission officially approaches Ukraine about the transit of any gas other than Russian, we naturally will discuss it and are ready to reach an appropriate agreement,&quot; Shmyhal noted in a statement on his Telegram channel. &quot;I stressed that Ukraine&apos;s agreement with Russia on gas transit comes to an end on 1st January 2025 and will not be extended.&quot; Shmyhal added that significant progress has been made over the past year to ensure EU countries have sufficient energy supplies, particularly gas. Slovakia and other nations relying on Russian gas transiting through Ukraine are engaged in discussions to prevent disruptions when the contract expires. Fico, ahead of his talks with Shmyhal, emphasized that maintaining gas transit is not solely a bilateral concern for Ukraine&#x2019;s neighbors but an issue affecting the entire European Union. Fico previously said his goal to ensure continued eastern gas supplies to avoid increased costs associated with alternative transit routes. Slovakia holds a long-term contract with Russian energy giant Gazprom. Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said earlier in Brussels that European countries and companies collectively require around 15 billion cubic meters of Russian gas next year via Ukraine and are negotiating ways to secure new supplies. Slovakia is aiming for an agreement covering gas deliveries for the next two to three years. The EU, meanwhile, has set a target to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-gas-transit-deal-ends-on-december-31-wont-be-renewed-pm-shmyhal-says/	2024-12-16T16:55:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-467548811.jpg
EU imposes sanctions on Chinese companies, North Korean minister over Ukraine war	The EU imposed fully fledged sanctions on Dec. 16, including asset freezes and visa bans, on Chinese firms for supplying Russia&apos;s military for the war against Ukraine. The bloc has also added North Korea&apos;s defense minister to its sanctions blacklist after the secretive state sent troops to Russia to reinforce its military. The move &#x2014; part of the EU&apos;s 15th round of sanctions during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine &#x2014; represented an effort to tackle the crucial role allegedly being played by China in keeping Russia&apos;s war machine going. The EU said it was blacklisting four Chinese companies for &quot;supplying sensitive drone components and microelectronic components&quot; to the Russian military, according to AFP. Two other firms and one Chinese businesswoman were hit for circumventing EU sanctions aimed at stopping equipment flowing to Moscow. Among the companies was Xiamen Limbach, alleged to have supplied engines for long-range attack drones used by Russia against Ukraine. The EU has previously targeted Chinese firms for supporting Russia&apos;s military. But until now, the bloc has imposed bans on European firms doing business with Chinese companies rather than the tougher sanctions now being applied. The EU also took aim at North Korea in the latest package after Pyongyang dispatched troops for Russia to fight Ukraine. The 27-nation bloc added defense minister No Kwang Chol and deputy chief of the general staff Kim Yong Bok to a number of North Korean officials already blacklisted. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported that at least 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded during assault operations near the villages of Plekhovo, Vorozhba, and Martynovka on Dec. 14-15. North Korean soldiers have been stationed in Kursk Oblast since October, initially taking on support roles. Their recent involvement in ground assault operations highlights the growing military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-imposes-sanctions-on-chinese-companies-north-korean-minister-over-ukraine-war/	2024-12-16T15:42:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1882258789.jpeg
Estonia urges NATO allies to boost defense spending to counter Russian threat, Reuters reports	Estonia plans to propose that members of the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force, a coalition of northern European NATO countries, commit at least 2.5% of GDP to defense spending in response to the ongoing threat from Russia, Prime Minister Kristen Michal said on Dec. 16. Currently, only 23 of NATO&apos;s 32 members are on track to meet the alliance&apos;s target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defense. &quot;Everybody in NATO and in the EU right now has the feeling in their backbone that you should increase defense expenditure because of what is happening all over the world and with Russia,&quot; Michal told Reuters, emphasizing that &quot;Europe as the wealthiest region of the world has to spend more on defense, security, and security.&quot; Michal will host the Joint Expeditionary Force leaders in Tallinn this week, with discussions set to focus on Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. He called the fleet &quot;an environmental disaster waiting to happen.&quot; Estonia has significantly increased its defense budget, allocating 3.2% of GDP to defense in 2024, more than double its spending since the all-out war in Ukraine began nearly three years ago. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to raise the U.K.&#x2019;s defense spending to 2.5% of GDP, but only after a defense strategy review and when financially feasible. Meanwhile, incoming U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to end the war in Ukraine quickly, though he has not provided details on his plans. Michal emphasized the importance of securing lasting peace and suggested seizing 200 to 300 billion euros of Russia&#x2019;s frozen assets to help rebuild Ukraine. He also proposed additional taxes on Russian goods, aiming to raise another 300 billion euros. &quot;That would bring lasting peace,&quot; Michal said, explaining that such measures would cripple Russia&#x2019;s ability to continue hostilities, including hybrid attacks, while strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s military resources. &quot;Ukraine is part of Europe; it should be a member of NATO,&quot; Michal added.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-urges-nato-allies-to-boost-defense-spending-to-counter-russian-threat-reuters-reports/	2024-12-16T13:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-477566314.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia sets goal to fully occupy 4 Ukrainian regions in 2025	Key developments on Dec. 16: Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said during a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16 that Moscow aims to seize the entirety of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in 2025. Speaking at a Defense Ministry meeting, Belousov reiterated Russia&apos;s commitment to achieving what he described as the &quot;goals announced by President Vladimir Putin in June.&quot; &quot;In 2025, Moscow plans to achieve victory in the war,&quot; he added. On June 14, Putin stated that Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from the four Ukrainian oblasts and formally abandoned its aspirations to join NATO. Putin&apos;s additional demands include recognizing Crimea and Sevastopol as part of Russia. &quot;As soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,&quot; Putin said at the time. Despite Russia&apos;s claims, large portions of these regions remain under Ukrainian control. Regional capitals Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are firmly held by Ukraine, while Moscow occupies parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, territories it initially invaded in 2014. During the Dec. 16 meeting, Belousov also emphasized the need for Russia to prepare for potential conflicts with NATO within the next decade. Putin&apos;s declaration of the illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in September 2022 was widely condemned internationally. The Kremlin continues to struggle in its attempts to secure full control over these regions amidst fierce Ukrainian resistance. President-elect Donald Trump expressed his intent to make &#x201C;a little progress&#x201D; in ending the war in Ukraine at his first news conference since winning the presidential election. Speaking from Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16, Trump described the conflict as &#x201C;horrible&#x201D; and emphasized the urgent need to stop it. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re trying to get the war stopped, that horrible, horrible war that&#x2019;s going on in Ukraine, Russia, Ukraine,&#x201D; Trump said. He added, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to get a little progress. It&#x2019;s a tough one, it&#x2019;s a nasty one, it&#x2019;s nasty.&#x201D; The President-elect criticized the high human cost of the conflict, claiming the death toll &#x201C;on both sides&#x201D; is likely far higher than reported. Trump attributed the heavy casualties to Ukraine&#x2019;s flat terrain, adding that &#x201C;the only thing that stops a bullet is a body, a human body.&#x201D; Trump confirmed he had not invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to his January inauguration but noted that Zelensky would be &#x201C;welcome&#x201D; if he chose to attend. The president-elect previously met with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Dec. 7 to discuss the war. According to Reuters, the meeting did not yield a specific peace plan, though Trump called for an immediate ceasefire, while Zelensky underscored the need for security guarantees. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is racing to deliver additional aid to Ukraine, announcing a $988 million military aid package on Dec. 7. However, Trump has signaled plans to reduce such assistance once in office to push Ukraine into negotiations that could include territorial concessions. Although critical of Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S. ATACMS missiles against Russian territory, Trump reiterated that he does not plan to &#x201C;abandon&#x201D; Ukraine. Instead, he aims to use U.S. support as leverage to pressure Kyiv and Moscow to reach a peace agreement. Ukraine is now among the nations with laser weapon capabilities, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, announced on Dec. 16, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. Speaking at the &quot;European Defense Industry: Prospects for Cooperation with the Ukrainian Defense Industry&quot; conference, Sukharevskyi said Ukraine&apos;s laser system, called Tryzub, can down aircraft at altitudes exceeding 2 kilometers. &quot;This laser is real and operational,&quot; he emphasized, adding that efforts are underway to scale up its capabilities. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t immediately verify Sukharevskyi&apos;s claim. Sukharevskyi also discussed the development of &quot;mother drones,&quot; or &quot;queen drones,&quot; which carry two FPV (first-person view) light attack drones. These drones, capable of flying over 70 kilometers into enemy territory, serve as repeaters and hit deep targets. He described this innovation as a &quot;breakthrough&quot; in Ukraine&apos;s drone technology. The Unmanned Systems Forces, established less than six months ago, already include combat and research units operating across air, land, and sea. Ukraine&apos;s defense industry has gained momentum since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov recently announced the serial production of Palianytsia, a lightweight missile-drone hybrid, further advancing Ukraine&apos;s military capabilities. North Korean troops have joined combat operations in the Kursk Oblast, marking the first confirmed engagement of North Korean soldiers alongside the Russian military, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder said on Dec. 16. &quot;We do assess that North Korean soldiers have engaged in combat in Kursk. We have indications that they have suffered casualties, both killed and wounded,&quot; Ryder said, as reported by Reuters. While the U.S. lacks precise casualty figures, Ryder added that North Korean troops began combat operations last week. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed that at least 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded during assault operations near the villages of Plekhovo, Vorozhba, and Martynovka on Dec. 14-15. Fresh reinforcements from North Korea&apos;s 94th Separate Brigade are reportedly being deployed to replace the losses. The HUR also alleged that a &quot;friendly-fire&quot; incident on Dec. 14 resulted in North Korean troops killing eight Russian soldiers. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify HUR&apos;s claims. North Korean soldiers have been present in Kursk Oblast since October, initially serving in support roles. Their recent participation in ground assault operations reflects a deepening military collaboration between Pyongyang and Moscow amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia should prepare for multiple scenarios, including a war with NATO, in the next 10 years, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said during a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16, the Interfax news agency reported. Speaking about a possible confrontation with the alliance, Belousov pointed to unspecified changes in NATO countries&apos; doctrines and conclusions reached during the Washington summit in July. &#x201C;(Preparing for war) is indicated by the decisions that were made at the North Atlantic Alliance summit held in July of this year. This is also reflected in the doctrinal documents of the United States and other NATO countries,&quot; Belousov said. During NATO&#x2019;s 75th-anniversary celebration and summit in July, Ukraine received more air defense systems, $43 billion in funding, a NATO representative in Kyiv, and new bilateral security agreements, as well as the pledge that its path toward membership is &quot;irreversible.&quot; Tensions between NATO and Russia have been mounting since the allied countries began providing arms and other support to Ukraine after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. Moscow has issued a number of veiled and overt threats to the West over its support for Kyiv, including warnings of a possible nuclear response. Multiple Western officials have raised warnings about a possible open clash with Russia in the coming years, with NATO leaders calling for increasing the defense spending benchmark from 2% to 3% of gross domestic product. Speaking at the meeting, Belousov claimed that Ukraine lost &quot;almost 1 million people&quot; during the full-scale war, a figure much higher than the numbers provided by Kyiv and the Western media. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine suffered 43,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 injured, while The Economist estimated Kyiv&apos;s casualties at 60,000-100,000 killed and 400,000 injured. Belousov also announced the planned creation of a military branch dedicated to unmanned systems, which should be finalized in the third quarter of 2025. Ukraine already established the Unmanned Systems Forces in September this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin also spoke at the meeting, accusing the West of &quot;pushing Russia to a red line from which we can no longer retreat.&quot; He further said that NATO is increasing its military presence near the Russian border and in other regions of the world. The Kremlin&apos;s chief went on to accuse the U.S. of preparing a deployment of missiles with a range of &quot;up to 5,500 kilometers&quot; in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, saying that Russia will lift &quot;all restrictions&quot; on the deployment of its own weapons if Washington takes this step. Russia withdrew from multiple treaties on nuclear arms during the full-scale war and deployed a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, Oreshnik, in a strike against Dnipro in November. Putin also claimed that Russian forces had conquered 189 settlements in Ukraine this year and that &quot;over 1,000&quot; people sign contracts with Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry every day to join the war. The European Union will train 75,000 Ukrainian military personnel as part of its EUMAM training mission by February 2025, EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas announced at a press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council on Dec. 16. &quot;The EU must continue supporting Ukraine militarily. By the end of winter, the EU will have trained 75,000 Ukrainian service members,&quot; Kallas said. Kallas also highlighted that the EU has provided Ukraine with 4.2 billion euros in budget support this month and will begin allocating 1.5 billion euros monthly starting January 2025. Kallas emphasized the importance of further aid, echoing Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha&apos;s call during the ministerial meeting for increased ammunition supplies, stronger air defenses, and expanded support for Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. &quot;We must give Ukraine what it needs to win the war,&quot; Kallas stressed. Launched in October 2022, the European Union Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM) has already trained approximately 60,000 Ukrainian troops as of August 2024, primarily in Germany and Poland.

Ukraine condemns Hungary’s ‘peacekeeping’ proposals, calls them manipulative	The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has criticized Hungary&apos;s &quot;peacekeeping&quot; statements as unrealistic and manipulative, calling on Hungarian officials on Dec. 16 to stop distorting the realities of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine for political gain. The ministry accused Hungary of effectively advocating for Ukraine to surrender to Russian aggression while obstructing international efforts to support Kyiv. &#x201C;Hungarian officials once again claim that they can stop the war. However, these statements do not reflect reality. Following Hungary&apos;s &apos;peacekeeping&apos; calls to Moscow, deadly missiles and drones are striking Ukrainian cities and communities,&#x201D; the ministry said in a statement. &#x201C;Hungary&#x2019;s actual proposals are even further from peacemaking than its statements,&#x201D; it added, noting that Budapest&#x2019;s continued unilateral contacts with Moscow undermine collective efforts to achieve a just and sustainable peace. The response came after Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto claimed on Dec. 15 that President Volodymyr Zelensky had &#x201C;forcefully but politely&#x201D; declined Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&#x2019;s proposal for a Christmas ceasefire. Hungary, which maintains close ties with Moscow despite Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has consistently criticized EU sanctions against Russia and blocked initiatives to provide military aid to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-condemns-hungarys-peacekeeping-stance-calls-it-manipulative/	2024-12-16T11:52:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157690664.jpg
North Korean troops suffer casualties in Russia’s Kursk Oblast, Pentagon confirms	North Korean troops have joined combat operations in the Kursk Oblast, marking the first confirmed engagement of North Korean soldiers alongside Russian military, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder said on Dec. 16. &#x201C;We do assess that North Korean soldiers have engaged in combat in Kursk. We have indications that they have suffered casualties, both killed and wounded,&#x201D; Ryder said, as reported by Reuters. While the U.S. lacks precise casualty figures, Ryder added that North Korean troops began combat operations last week. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence (HUR) claimed that at least 30 North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded during assault operations near the villages of Plekhovo, Vorozhba, and Martynovka on Dec. 14-15. Fresh reinforcements from North Korea&#x2019;s 94th Separate Brigade are reportedly being deployed to replace the losses. The HUR also alleged that a &quot;friendly-fire&quot; incident on Dec. 14 resulted in North Korean troops killing eight Russian soldiers. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify HUR&#x2019;s claims. North Korean soldiers have been present in Kursk Oblast since October, initially serving in support roles. Their recent participation in ground assault operations reflects a deepening military collaboration between Pyongyang and Moscow amidst ongoing war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-suffer-casualties-in-russias-kursk-oblast-pentagon-confirms/	2024-12-16T11:22:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1767541245.jpg
It's a tough one,' Trump says following questions on how he plans to stop Russia's war against Ukraine	At his first news conference since winning the presidential election, President-elect Donald Trump expressed his intent to make &#x201C;a little progress&#x201D; in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking from Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 16, Trump described the conflict as &#x201C;horrible&#x201D; and emphasized the urgent need to stop it. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re trying to get the war stopped, that horrible, horrible war that&#x2019;s going on in Ukraine, Russia, Ukraine,&#x201D; Trump said. He added, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to get a little progress. It&#x2019;s a tough one, it&#x2019;s a nasty one, it&#x2019;s nasty.&#x201D; The President-elect criticized the high human cost of the conflict, claiming the death toll &#x201C;on both sides&#x201D; is likely far higher than reported. Trump attributed the heavy casualties to Ukraine&#x2019;s flat terrain, adding that &#x201C;the only thing that stops a bullet is a body, a human body.&#x201D; Trump confirmed he had not invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to his January inauguration but noted that Zelensky would be &#x201C;welcome&#x201D; if he chose to attend. The president-elect previously met with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Dec. 7 to discuss the war. According to Reuters, the meeting did not yield a specific peace plan, though Trump called for an immediate ceasefire, while Zelensky underscored the need for security guarantees. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is racing to deliver additional aid to Ukraine, announcing a $988 million military aid package on Dec. 7. However, Trump has signaled plans to reduce such assistance once in office to push Ukraine into negotiations that could include territorial concessions. Although critical of Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S. ATACMS missiles against Russian territory, Trump reiterated that he does not plan to &#x201C;abandon&#x201D; Ukraine. Instead, he aims to use U.S. support as leverage to pressure Kyiv and Moscow to reach a peace agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-vows-a-little-progress-on-ukraine-war-at-first-news-conference/	2024-12-16T10:44:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183887240.jpg
EU will train 75,000 Ukrainian soldiers by early 2025, chief diplomat says	The European Union will train 75,000 Ukrainian military personnel as part of its EUMAM training mission by February 2025, EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas announced at a press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council on Dec. 16. &#x201C;The EU must continue supporting Ukraine militarily. By the end of winter, the EU will have trained 75,000 Ukrainian service members,&#x201D; Kallas said. Kallas also highlighted that the EU has provided Ukraine with 4.2 billion euros in budget support this month and will begin allocating 1.5 billion euros monthly starting January 2025. Kallas emphasized the importance of further aid, echoing Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha&apos;s call during the ministerial meeting for increased ammunition supplies, stronger air defenses, and expanded support for Ukraine&apos;s defense industry. &#x201C;We must give Ukraine what it needs to win the war,&#x201D; Kallas stressed. Launched in October 2022, the European Union Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM) has already trained approximately 60,000 Ukrainian troops as of August 2024, primarily in Germany and Poland. The mission focuses on improving the operational capabilities of Ukrainian forces to bolster their resistance against Russia&#x2019;s aggression. The EU&apos;s previous top diplomat, Josep Borrell, hailed EUMAM as the &quot;most successful training mission the EU has ever launched.&quot; With this expanded commitment, the EU continues to strengthen its military support for Ukraine as the war enters its third winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-train-75-000-ukrainian-soldiers-by-early-2025-chief-diplomat-says/	2024-12-16T10:03:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1475813059.jpg
Bundestag votes no confidence in Scholz government, elections set for February	Chancellor Olaf Scholz failed a confidence vote in the Bundestag on Dec. 16, paving the way for early parliamentary elections scheduled for Feb. 23. Out of 717 lawmakers who participated in the vote, only 207 supported Scholz&#x2019;s government, matching the size of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) faction. A total of 394 MPs expressed no confidence, while 116 abstained. The SPD faces criticism for its defense policies, including its refusal to deliver Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine. According to a leaked draft of the party&apos;s election platform, the SPD remains opposed to the missiles, citing that providing them could escalate Germany&#x2019;s involvement in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Scholz has maintained this stance despite calls from Kyiv and other Western allies. Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has voiced support for supplying Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Merz, whose CDU/CSU alliance is leading in the polls ahead of the February election, visited Kyiv and pledged a more assertive approach to arming Ukraine. &quot;We want your army to be capable of hitting military bases in Russia. Not civilians, not infrastructure, but military targets from which your country is being attacked,&quot; Merz said during his visit, although he cautioned that the missiles would not be a &#x201C;miraculous&#x201D; solution to the conflict. The CDU&#x2019;s election platform reportedly commits to comprehensive support for Ukraine, including diplomatic, financial, humanitarian, and military aid. Merz has also argued that Germany could lift restrictions on the Taurus missiles without becoming a direct participant in the war, following precedents set by the U.K. and U.S. As the elections approach, defense and foreign policy are likely to remain central issues, with the CDU positioning itself as a stronger ally to Ukraine compared to Scholz&#x2019;s SPD.	https://kyivindependent.com/bundestag-votes-no-confidence-in-scholz-government-elections-set-for-february/	2024-12-16T09:28:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183251616-1.jpg
Ukraine possesses laser weapons, advanced drone technologies, commander says	Ukraine is now among the nations with laser weapon capabilities, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, announced on Dec. 16, as reported by Interfax-Ukraine. Speaking at the &#x201C;European Defense Industry: Prospects for Cooperation with the Ukrainian Defense Industry&#x201D; conference, Sukharevskyi said Ukraine&#x2019;s laser system, called Tryzub, can down aircraft at altitudes exceeding 2 kilometers. &#x201C;This laser is real and operational,&#x201D; he emphasized, adding that efforts are underway to scale up its capabilities. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t immediately verify Sukharevskyi&apos;s claim. Sukharevskyi also discussed the development of &quot;mother drones,&quot; or &#x201C;queen drones,&#x201D; which carry two FPV (first-person view) light attack drones. These drones, capable of flying over 70 kilometers into enemy territory, serve as repeaters and hit deep targets. He described this innovation as a &#x201C;breakthrough&#x201D; in Ukraine&#x2019;s drone technology. The Unmanned Systems Forces established less than six months ago, already include combat and research units operating across air, land, and sea. Ukraine&#x2019;s defense industry has gained momentum since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov recently announced the serial production of Palianytsia, a lightweight missile-drone hybrid, further advancing Ukraine&#x2019;s military capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-unveils-laser-weapon-and-advanced-drone-technologies-commander-says/	2024-12-16T08:34:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156537456.jpg
EU imposes new sanctions on Belarusian officials and companies supporting Lukashenko regime	On Dec. 16, the Council of the EU adopted restrictive measures against 26 individuals and two companies linked to the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. The sanctions target judges who sentenced opposition figures, law enforcement officials involved in persecuting dissidents, and heads of penitentiaries where political prisoners are held. Additionally, the measures apply to individuals and companies benefiting from privileges under Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime and involved in circumventing existing European sanctions. Among the sanctioned entities are Belarusian companies Vlate Logistik and Ruzekspeditsiya, along with their owners and co-owners. Lukashenko, in power since 1994, is widely regarded as a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. His leadership has been surrounded by accusations of rigged elections, including the 2020 presidential election, during which opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya gained widespread public support. Despite claims that Tsikhanouskaya won the election, Lukashenko declared victory, sparking mass protests. The demonstrations in Minsk and across Belarus were violently suppressed with Russia&#x2019;s backing. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, more than 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since 2020. The EU continues to apply pressure on Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime as part of broader measures targeting human rights abuses and support for Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-imposes-new-sanctions-on-belarusian-officials-and-companies-supporting-lukashenko-regime/	2024-12-16T08:01:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153837875.jpg
As US pushes Kyiv to lower draft age, why won’t Ukraine conscript younger men?	One thing stands out when looking at Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces &#x2014; it is made up predominantly of older men. Ukraine has never publicly released information about the age of its troops, but the average age is reportedly around 43 years old. Exact figures on the size of Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces are also not publicly known, with estimates ranging from the hundreds of thousands to around 1 million. Time journalist Simon Shuster, who published a book profiling President Volodymyr Zelensky in January 2024, quoted one of Zelensky&#x2019;s aides who was concerned about the age of Ukrainian troops. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re grown men now, and they aren&#x2019;t that healthy to begin with,&#x201D; the unnamed aide told Shuster. &#x201C;This is Ukraine. Not Scandinavia.&#x201D; With some exceptions, Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave the country during martial law, but only men over 25 are eligible for the draft. Until earlier this year, the minimum draft age was 27. Despite lowering the draft age to 25, news emerged in mid-October that U.S. lawmakers were pressuring Kyiv to further lower the draft age. Presidential Office advisor Serhii Leshchenko wrote on X that &#x201C;politicians from both parties&#x201D; were pushing Ukraine to start mobilizing its 18-25-year-olds. The unnamed U.S. lawmakers reportedly cited the fact that America drafted men aged 18-26 during the Vietnam War when some 2.2 million U.S. soldiers were conscripted to fight through the selective service process. The average age of an American soldier in Vietnam was around 22 years old. The conscription of young men to fight in Vietnam was a major catalyst of the anti-war movement, drawing hundreds of thousands to protest and an estimated 30,000 men to emigrate to avoid the draft. Active conscription ended in the U.S. in 1973. In more recent wars, American soldiers were statistically older, with the average age of an American soldier in the Gulf War around 27 years old. Data from 2010 shows the average age of an American soldier deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan was 33.4 years old. Zelensky has refused to budge on changing the conscription age and has instead continued to press for the delivery of more U.S. military aid. Western allies provided enough aid to fully equip only 2.5 out of the 10 Ukrainian brigades that Ukraine had requested support for, Zelensky said in an interview with Sky News published on Nov. 29. The Associated Press reported at the end of November that the Biden administration is still pushing for Ukraine&#x2019;s draft age to be lowered. &#x201C;The pure math of Ukraine&#x2019;s situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight,&#x201D; AP quoted an unnamed senior Biden administration official. In addition to men, women aged 18 to 60 with a medical or pharmaceutical education have been required to be on the military register since 1992 but are still allowed to leave the country. Until April 2024, Ukrainian men only became eligible for conscription at 27. Ukraine&#x2019;s draft age was lowered to 25 in April when Ukraine updated several laws on mobilization to ramp up the number of available troops amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The laws simplified the process for identifying eligible conscripts, introduced additional penalties for those dodging the draft, and lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. There are no official figures for the number of men who have escaped mobilization abroad, but over 20,000 have reportedly illegally left Ukraine. Law enforcement agencies have uncovered around 600 criminal networks that help evade military service by aiding them in fleeing abroad. Despite reports, Kyiv has said it does not have concrete plans to bring back military-aged men who are in the EU forcibly.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Other men are dodging the draft in Ukraine by staying away from official employment and keeping a low profile to avoid being noticed by draft officers. Exact estimates of how many men are avoiding the draft internally are impossible to know. After signing the law lowering the age of military service, President Zelensky said that Ukraine&#x2019;s military needs younger men because they are physically fitter than older men and can master technology used on the battlefield faster. &quot;This is a request from the military command in response to the specific needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,&quot; Zelensky said in an interview with French YouTuber Hugo Travers. &quot;With all due respect to our fighters, there&apos;s a difference between a 25-year-old combatant and a 50-year-old one.&quot; Younger fighters can also master the different technologies used on the battlefield, Zelensky said. &quot;This is a modern type of war,&quot; especially in terms of technologies such as aerial and maritime drones and cybersecurity. &quot;The new generation masters new technologies much more rapidly,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine is unlikely to lower the age further. One argument Kyiv has cited is that its armed forces already suffer from a lack of equipment, a situation made worse by delays in military aid from partners like the U.S. &#x201C;It doesn&apos;t make sense to see calls for Ukraine to lower the mobilization age, presumably in order to draft more people, when we can see that previously announced equipment is not arriving on time,&#x201D; Dmytro Lytvyn, Zelensky&apos;s communications adviser, wrote on X on Nov. 27. &#x201C;Because of these delays, Ukraine lacks weapons to equip already mobilized soldiers.&#x201D; Zelensky repeated this argument in an interview with Sky News on Nov. 29, when he said that Ukraine will &quot;never have enough resources&#x201D; if the West doesn&apos;t provide enough aid. &quot;They speak about mobilization, but the real problem (is) with 10 brigades which our partners didn&apos;t equip.&quot; U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said during a meeting with journalists on Dec. 9 that the U.S. was ready to take over the training of new Ukrainian soldiers and provide them with the necessary weapons if Ukraine changes its mobilization policy.

(Jose Colon/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#x201C;Ultimately, the decisions about the composition of its military force are those are decisions that the Ukrainians have to make for themselves,&#x201D; Miller said. Later on Dec. 9, Zelensky wrote on social media that Ukraine will not use &quot;the youth of soldiers&quot; to make up for its gaps in military equipment and training. &#x201C;The priority should be providing missiles and lowering Russia&apos;s military potential, not Ukraine&apos;s draft age. The goal should be to preserve as many lives as possible, not to preserve weapons in storage.&quot; Regardless of training or equipment, one reason why Ukraine&#x2019;s draft age is not 18 likely relates to concerns about the country&#x2019;s demography. &#x201C;If you have a look at Ukraine&apos;s demographic tree, it makes perfect sense,&#x201D; retired Australian Major General Mick Ryan told the Kyiv Independent. Like other countries that gained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine &#x201C;saw a fairly significant drop-off in birth rates, and that&apos;s now manifesting as a smaller population of people under 30 than a lot of other countries, say, in Europe or the U.S. or Australia.&#x201D; Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated Ukraine&#x2019;s serious demographic crisis. Ukraine&apos;s population has declined by over 10 million since Russia first invaded in 2014 and fell to an estimated 37 million by January 2024.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Ukraine has the lowest birthrate in Europe and an increasingly aged population, with 30% of the population of retirement age. &#xA0; From Ukraine&#x2019;s perspective, &#x201C;we understand we need young men to fight, but we also need young men to have kids,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;This is kind of a pragmatic balance that the Ukrainians are trying to achieve, and it&apos;s the kind of dilemma that no country would really want to have to resolve because there&apos;s probably no resolving it.&#x201D; However, the U.S. is &#x201C;probably using a harsher calculus,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;They&apos;re probably coming from the perspective of &#x2018;if you don&apos;t win the war, your demography won&apos;t matter.&#x2019;&#x201D; &#x201C;There just is no single or simple solution to this. Every potential solution involves trade-offs and every potential solution will have political, human, and societal impacts.&#x201D; The lowering of the draft age appears to be an unpopular sentiment in Ukraine, even among those already serving in the military. Maria Berlinska, a Ukrainian activist and veteran, spoke out against the pressure from Ukraine&#x2019;s partners to lower the draft age, writing on Facebook that she was &#x201C;categorically against it.&#x201D; &#x201C;Sending yesterday&apos;s schoolchildren to the front who have not yet seen life is unreasonable and dishonest,&#x201D; Berlinska argued. Her thoughts were echoed by 43-year-old Ukrainian soldier and writer Artem Chekh, who wrote on Facebook on Dec. 10 that men under 25 &#x201C;have not yet lived.&#x201D; &#x201C;The most absurdity is noticeable in the U.S., where you can&apos;t legally drink until 21, but you could be taken to war,&#x201D; Chekh said. In her post, Berlinska argued that Ukraine should receive manpower from abroad, rather than asking more Ukrainian youths to fight. &#x201C;We are now holding back the invasion of the Axis of Evil countries, we are keeping security for all of Europe, for many NATO countries, with a shield. Therefore, it is time for their armies to get involved, it is time to send their people here.&#x201D; &#x201C;Do you want our children to fight? Ok, no problem, just together with your children.&#x201D; Katya Denisova and Chris York contributed to this report.	https://kyivindependent.com/as-us-pushes-for-ukraine-to-lower-draft-age-why-wont-ukraine-conscript-younger-men/	2024-12-16T07:18:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162045293.jpg
Russia sets 2025 goal to fully occupy 4 Ukrainian regions, Defense Minister says	Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said during a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16 that Moscow aims to seize the entirety of Ukraine&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in 2025. Speaking at a Defense Ministry meeting, Belousov reiterated Russia&#x2019;s commitment to achieving what he described as the &quot;goals announced by President Vladimir Putin in June.&quot; &quot;In 2025, Moscow plans to achieve victory in the war,&quot; he added. On June 14, Putin stated that Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdraws from the four Ukrainian oblasts and formally abandons its aspirations to join NATO. Putin&#x2019;s additional demands include recognizing Crimea and Sevastopol as part of Russia. &quot;As soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,&quot; Putin said at the time. Despite Russia&#x2019;s claims, large portions of these regions remain under Ukrainian control. Regional capitals Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are firmly held by Ukraine, while Moscow occupies parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, territories it initially invaded in 2014. During the Dec. 16 meeting, Belousov also emphasized the need for Russia to prepare for potential conflicts with NATO within the next decade. Putin&apos;s declaration of the illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in September 2022 was widely condemned internationally. The Kremlin continues to struggle in its attempts to secure full control over these regions amidst fierce Ukrainian resistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-sets-2025-goal-to-fully-occupy-four-ukrainian-regions-defense-minister-says/	2024-12-16T07:05:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152227305.jpg
Ukraine charges Russian general over use of banned chemical weapons	Ukrainian prosecutors charged Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces&apos; radiation, chemical, and biological defense troops, in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Dec. 16. According to the SBU&apos;s investigation, chemical weapons have been used in more than 4,800 cases since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Since 2022, over 2,000 Ukrainian service members have been hospitalized with chemical poisoning, and three have died, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk said earlier this week. &quot;Russian forces mostly use ammunition with toxic substances by dropping them from FPV (first-person-view) drones on Ukrainian positions. When chemical grenades are detonated, their poisonous compounds affect human mucous membranes, especially the eyes and respiratory tract,&quot; the SBU&#x2019;s statement said. When detonated, the irritating gases force Ukrainian soldiers finding cover in the trenches to leave and expose themselves to Russian gunfire, the statement noted. Ukraine handed over soil samples that prove the use of banned materials to independent laboratories of the International Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for examination and were confirmed to breach international humanitarian law. Russia&apos;s use of gas attacks is rising, a Kyiv Independent investigation from August showed. Ukrainian soldiers and officers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent acknowledged that the tactic is effective, allowing Moscow to capture positions occasionally without destroying them. The U.K. issued sanctions against Kirillov and his unit over the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine on Oct. 8. Earlier this year, the U.S. State Department confirmed that Russian forces had used the chemical agent chloropicrin in Ukraine. &#xA0;The announcement was part of a larger statement about introducing new U.S. sanctions against more than 280 individuals and entities.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-charges-russian-general-over-use-of-banned-chemical-munitions/	2024-12-16T06:14:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1239649816.jpg
Assad releases first statement since fleeing to Russia, claims he never considered 'seeking refuge'	Toppled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has released his first public statement since fleeing Syria, claiming he never considered &quot;stepping down or seeking refuge&quot; despite leaving the country for Russia. In a post on the official Facebook page of the Syrian presidency, Assad said he was releasing the statement to address &quot;misinformation and narratives far removed from the truth&quot; in the wake of his overthrow. Syrian rebels announced on Dec. 8 that they successfully ousted Assad from power following a lightning offensive across the country, which culminated with the capture of the capital city of Damascus. Moscow persuaded Assad to flee to Russia with his family after realizing his regime was bound to lose to the opposition&apos;s rapid advance, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 11, citing its sources. In the statement, Assad attempts to dispute this version of events. &quot;First, my departure from Syria was neither planned nor did it occur during the final hours of the battles, as some have claimed,&quot; he said. &quot;On the contrary, I remained in Damascus, carrying out my duties until the early hours of Sunday 8th December 2024.&quot; Assad claims that after rebel forces closed in on Damascus, he moved to Latakia &quot;in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations&quot; at a military base. When the base itself came under drone attack, Assad claims Moscow requested &quot;an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th December.&quot; &quot;This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the final military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions,&quot; he added. Despite detailing Moscow&apos;s request to evacuate him, Assad then goes on to claim that at &quot;no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party.&quot; &quot;The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.&quot; Assad does not explain how he continued &quot;fighting against the terrorist onslaught&quot; once he fled Syria, but goes on to try and paint himself in a positive light as someone who couldn&apos;t &quot;forsake his own people or betray the army and nation to which he belongs.&quot; &quot;I have never sought positions for personal gain but have always considered myself as a custodian of a national project, supported by the faith of the Syrian people, who believed in its vision,&quot; he said. On Dec. 15, the Financial Times (FT) reported that Assad airlifted $250 million in cash to Moscow between 2018-19. Quoting financial records seen by the newspaper, the FT said Syria&apos;s central bank flew nearly two tonnes of $100 bills and 500 euro notes into the country, which were then deposited in sanctioned Russian banks. The outlet said the transfers occurred at a time when Syria was heavily indebted to Russia for its military support, and while Assad&apos;s relatives were buying up assets in Russia including luxury apartments. Assad also claims to have only ever acted as a defender of the Syrian people. &quot;I have carried an unwavering conviction in their will and ability to protect the state, defend its institutions, and uphold their choices to the very last moment,&quot; he said. &quot;When the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost, any position becomes void of purpose, rendering its occupation meaningless. This does not, in any way, diminish my profound sense of belonging to Syria and her people &#x2014; a bond that remains unshaken by any position or circumstance.&quot; After a popular uprising in 2011, Assad imprisoned, tortured, and disappeared tens of thousands of Syrians. His armed forces indiscriminately destroyed entire cities, and repeatedly used chemical weapons against Syrian civilians.	https://kyivindependent.com/assad-releases-first-statement-since-fleeing-to-russia-claims-he-never-considered-seeking-refuge/	2024-12-16T06:01:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2187892433.jpg
Russia must be ready for potential conflict with NATO 'within 10 years,' defense minister says	Russia should prepare for multiple scenarios, including a war with NATO, in the next 10 years, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said during a Defense Ministry meeting on Dec. 16, the Interfax news agency reported. Speaking about a possible confrontation with the alliance, Belousov pointed to unspecified changes in NATO countries&apos; doctrines and conclusions reached during the Washington summit in July. &#x201C;(Preparing for war) is indicated by the decisions that were made at the North Atlantic Alliance summit held in July of this year. This is also reflected in the doctrinal documents of the United States and other NATO countries,&quot; Belousov said. During NATO&#x2019;s 75th-anniversary celebration and summit in July, Ukraine received more air defense systems, $43 billion in funding, a NATO representative in Kyiv, and new bilateral security agreements, as well as the pledge that its path toward membership is &quot;irreversible.&quot; Tensions between NATO and Russia have been mounting since the allied countries began providing arms and other support to Ukraine after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. Moscow has issued a number of veiled and overt threats to the West over its support for Kyiv, including warnings of a possible nuclear response. Multiple Western officials have raised warnings about a possible open clash with Russia in the coming years, with NATO leaders calling for increasing the defense spending benchmark from 2% to 3% of gross domestic product.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-for-possible-conflict-with-nato/	2024-12-16T05:00:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152474190.jpg
Assad airlifted $250m in cash from Syria to Russia over two years, FT reports	Toppled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad airlifted $250m in cash to Moscow between 2018-19, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Dec. 15. Quoting financial records seen by the newspaper, the FT said Syria&apos;s central bank flew nearly two tonnes of $100 bills and &#x20AC;500 notes into the country, which were then deposited in sanctioned Russian banks. The outlet said the transfers occurred at at time when Syria was heavily indebted to Russia for its military support, and while Assad&apos;s relatives were buying up assets in Russia including luxury apartments. Moscow deployed its troops to Syria in 2015, providing support to the Assad regime against multiple anti-government forces. Syrian rebels announced on Dec. 8 that they successfully ousted Assad from power following a lightning offensive across the country, which culminated with the capture of the capital city of Damascus. Moscow persuaded Assad to flee to Russia with his family after realizing his regime was bound to lose to the opposition&apos;s rapid advance, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 11, citing its sources. One expert told the FT the transfers of cash from Domascus to Moscow were were evidence of &quot;a combination of securing their ill-gotten gains and Syria&#x2019;s patrimony abroad.&quot; &quot;The regime would have to bring their money abroad to a safe haven to be able to use it to procure the fine life&#x2026; for the regime and its inner circle,&quot; David Schenker, US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs from 2019 to 2021, said. With Assad now ousted, the future of Russia&apos;s military presence in Syria has been thrown into question. Satellite imagery collected by Maxar on Dec. 13 suggested Russia is preparing to scale back its military operations. Two AN-124 heavy military transport planes were spotted at Khmeimim air base, located in Latakia on Syria&#x2019;s Mediterranean coast, with their nose cones lifted, signaling readiness to load cargo. A Ka-52 attack helicopter was also being dismantled, likely in preparation for transport, while components of an S-400 air defense system were being packed up. Imagery from the Tartus naval base, also on the Mediterranean coast, showed minimal changes. Photos taken earlier in the week revealed two Russian frigates stationed off the coast, with no major activity suggesting an immediate departure, according to CNN. Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, described the activity as part of a larger consolidation effort at Khmeimim and the nearby Tartus naval base. &quot;In short, a withdrawal is underway,&quot; Kofman wrote on X. Russia was reportedly evacuating its forces from Syria as one of its military bases faced siege, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Intelligence (HUR) reported on Dec. 10. HUR claimed that Russian troops in Syria are voicing frustration with their commanders over what they described as a chaotic withdrawal process. The Kremlin emphasized the importance of securing its military bases and diplomatic missions in Syria, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying on Dec. 11 that Moscow has maintained contact with Syria&#x2019;s new leadership. He declined to disclose the number of Russian troops in the country or comment on potential evacuations.	https://kyivindependent.com/assad-airlifted-250m-in-cash-to-moscow-over-two-years-ft-reports/	2024-12-16T04:20:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2162733024.jpg
Norway to provide $242 million for Ukrainian naval defense against Russian Black Sea threats	Norway will allocate 2.7 billion Norwegian kroner ($242 million) to bolster Ukraine&#x2019;s navy and help it deter Russian threats in the Black Sea, the country&#x2019;s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere announced on Dec. 16. &quot;It is essential to protect the Ukrainian population and Ukrainian infrastructure from attacks by Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet&#x2026; (and to) protect exports by sea of grain and other products,&quot; Stoere said in a statement. The money will be channeled through the Nansen Support Program, Norway&apos;s civil and military support program for Ukraine. The Black Sea remains heavily mined due to Russia&apos;s full-scale war, seriously threatening civilian vessels. Minesweeping capabilities would help Ukraine strengthen security in the Black Sea, and enable continued shipping. &quot;Mines pose a significant threat to maritime security and safe passage in the Black Sea, and mine clearance operations are very difficult,&quot; Norway&#x2019;s Defense Minister Bjorn Arild Gram said. &quot;The systems we are providing will enhance the ability of Ukrainian forces to detect and defuse mines along their coastline,&quot; he added. Following the announcement, the Nansen program&#x2019;s total value grew to 137.7 billion kroner ($13.2 billion). The program initially was set to spend 75 billion kroner ($7 billion) from 2023 to 2028. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-provide-242-million-for-ukrainian-naval-defense-against-russian-black-sea-threats/	2024-12-16T03:41:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1877343521.jpg
Ukraine produces almost 100 new Peklo missile-drones, media reports	Almost 100 of Ukraine&apos;s new Peklo missile-drone hybrids have been produced as the weapon entered serial production, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Dec. 16. The news comes amid Ukraine&apos;s efforts to ramp up production of long-range drones and missiles as part of the country&apos;s resilience plan. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year. While some details of Peklo&apos;s capabilities remain undisclosed for security reasons, Zelensky highlighted the weapon as a &quot;fundamentally new type.&quot; The Peklo has a range of 700 kilometers (430 miles) and a speed of 700 km/h (430 mph). Officials reportedly said that the system has already been successfully deployed. The weapon represents a mix of drone and missile capabilities, functioning as a long-range drone equipped with a jet engine and more advanced guidance system, Ukrainska Pravda wrote. According to the outlet, 70% of Peklo&apos;s components are produced in Ukraine, but importing the rest into the country represents a serious bottleneck. The interchangeability of elements bridges estimated gaps in supply; for example, Peklo can reportedly run on different engines, depending on their availability on the market. Long-range domestic weapons are critical to Ukraine&#x2019;s defense strategy. They provide the country&apos;s military with an alternative to Western arms, whose use is often restricted. They also compensate for the lack of artillery ammunition on the battlefield. Achieving the target number of missile production next year also means that Ukrainian rockets will be smaller than usual, contradicting Russia&#x2019;s bet on bigger missiles such as the recently developed Oreshnik.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-produces-almost-100-peklo-missiles/	2024-12-16T02:55:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-06-at-1_51_00-PM.jpeg
30 North Korean soldiers killed, injured in Kursk Oblast assaults, Ukraine's intelligence claims	At least thirty North Korean soldiers were killed or wounded during assault operations in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) claimed on Dec. 16. Following the attacks that took place on Dec. 14-15 near the villages of Pliekhovo, Vorozhba, and Martynovka, North Korean losses have to be replenished by fresh soldiers from North Korea&apos;s 94th Separate Brigade, HUR claimed. Three soldiers also reportedly went missing. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify HUR&#x2019;s claims. Ukrainian and Western officials warned in the fall that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The move represents an unprecedented escalation in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The first limited clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November, with North Korean soldiers recently joining ground assault operations. North Korean troops also allegedly opened fire and killed eight Russian soldiers on Dec. 14 in a &quot;friendly-fire&quot; incident.	https://kyivindependent.com/30-north-korean-troops-killed-wounded-hur-says/	2024-12-16T02:19:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg
EU adopts 15th package of sanctions against Russia	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. The Council of the EU adopted on Dec. 16 its 15th package of sanctions against Russia, targeting the Russian shadow fleet of tankers and the military-industrial complex. The new listings include 54 persons and 30 entities &quot;responsible for actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,&quot; the statement read. &quot;This package of sanctions is part of our response to weaken Russia&#x2019;s war machine and those who are enabling this war, also including Chinese companies,&quot; said Kaja Kallas, the EU&apos;s chief diplomat. &quot;It shows the unity of EU member states in our continued support to Ukraine. Our immediate priority is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.&quot; The new package of sanctions targets shipping companies helping Russia to sell its crude oil, filling Moscow&apos;s coffers amid the full-scale war. &#xA0;The EU also banned 52 vessels transporting Russian oil above the $60-per-barrel price cap from accessing EU ports and services. Russia has largely avoided the price cap by using a fleet of older, uninsured tankers, forcing the Western countries to tighten and refine the existing sanctions. The latest package further targets a chemical plant, a Russian airline company providing support to the military, and defense companies. For the first time, the EU imposed full-blown sanctions &#x2013; including a travel ban and asset freeze &#x2013; &quot;on various Chinese actors supplying drone components and microelectronic components&quot; to Russia. Individual listings include the Russian military unit responsible for a deadly strike against the Ohkmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv in July, top managers of energy companies, individuals involved in the deportation of Ukrainian children, dissemination of propaganda, and sanctions circumvention, and two senior North Korean officials. The EU sanctioned North Korean officials after Pyongyang dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war. North Korean soldiers recently saw combat with Ukraine during ground assaults in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The bloc further added 32 entities to the list of those directly supporting Russia&apos;s military-industrial complex, including companies based in China, India, Iran, Serbia, and the United Arab Emirates.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-adopts-15th-package-of-sanctions/	2024-12-16T02:07:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1882258789.jpeg
Russian attacks against Ukraine injure 6 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine injured at least six civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Dec. 16. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 27 of the 49 drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force said. Nineteen drones were reportedly lost across the country thanks to electronic warfare countermeasures. Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast injured two people &#x2013; a 48-year-old woman in Kharkiv and a 54-year-old woman in the village of Kutkivka, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Two other people were injured during strikes against Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Mykolaiv Oblast, two men aged 50 and 53 were hospitalized following a drone attack against the city of Mykolaiv, according to Vitalii Kim, the regional governor. Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-113/	2024-12-16T01:59:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Donetsk-Oblast-Dec-16.jpg
Russian ex-Defense Ministry official suspected of embezzling $5.8 million	Vladimir Shishov, the former deputy head of the Russian Defense Ministry&apos;s military property department, is suspected of involvement in the embezzlement of 600 million rubles ($5.8 million), Russian Interior Ministry official Andrey Kurnosenko told the state-owned TASS news agency in an interview published on Dec. 16. According to the charges, Shishov embezzled 600 million rubles with the help of businessman Dmitry Levchenko, the manager of the RNGS Capital company. The ex-Defense Ministry official served in one of the highest echelons of state service. Shishov was arrested on suspicion of fraud in October 2023 in a case that the Russian media linked to fraud regarding the supply of timber for Russian troops in the occupied parts of eastern Ukraine. The embezzled money was allocated for a &quot;special infrastructure project,&quot; Kurnosenko said. Since April, several Russian high-ranking military officials have been arrested on charges ranging from bribery to abuse of power after the dismissal of Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov. In mid-May, Russian President Vladimir Putin also dismissed his longtime ally Sergei Shoigu from the post of defense minister. Shoigu was replaced by former First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov. Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) recently reported a sharp increase in registered criminal proceedings for bribery in the Russian military. Transparency International&apos;s 2023 corruption perception index saw Russia drop to its worst score in years, while Ukraine&apos;s score has improved, continuing the decade-old trend.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-charges-ex-defense-ministry-official-with-embezzlement/	2024-12-16T00:50:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/Moscow_Frunzenskaya_Embankment_at_Pushkinsky_Bridge_08-2016.jpg
Ukrainian drones destroy Russian ammunition depot in Donetsk Oblast, SBU source claims	The Security Service of Ukraine&apos;s (SBU) drones successfully attacked &#x430; Russian ammunition depot near the occupied village of Markine in Donetsk oblast a &quot;few days ago,&quot; an SBU source told the Kyiv Independent on Dec. 16. &quot;There were thousands of ammunition rounds for armored personnel carriers, tanks, anti-tank guided missiles, mines, grenades, and millions of rounds of ammunition of various calibers,&quot; the source said. A nearby fuel and lubricants depot was also destroyed as explosions could be heard in the area throughout the night, the source added. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Ukraine has been increasingly capable of striking ammunition and weapon depots in the rear to stall the Kremlin&apos;s logistics, hindering Russia&apos;s operations on the front line. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video that purports to show an explosion at a Russian ammunition depot near occupied Markine, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, overnight on Dec. 16, 2024. (SBU source)Some of Ukraine&apos;s domestically produced drones have become capable of traveling 1,500 kilometers (over 900 miles), reaching depots in the rear that were thought to be at a safe distance from the front line. Some of the examples this year include the strikes against the Russian towns of Tikhoretsk and Toropets with drones, setting ablaze over 30,000 tons of ammunition, allegedly including ballistic missiles. Ukraine has also been targeting oil refineries to prevent Moscow from adequately rotating its troops, resupply, and fortify its positions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drones-hit-russian-ammunition-depot-in-donetsk-oblast-sbu-source-claims/	2024-12-16T00:23:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/SBU-Dec-16.png
South Africa will not invite Putin to next G20 summit over ICC arrest warrant	Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be invited to the next G20 summit due to a pending arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), a spokesperson of the South African president told Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency on Dec. 15. South Africa, which has chaired the organization since Dec. 1, was also unable to host the Russian leader in August during their BRICS meeting in Johannesburg. &quot;The legal situation has not changed since the BRICS summit in Johannesburg. We cannot influence the ICC&apos;s decisions in any way,&quot; spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said, according to TASS. The next G20 summit is scheduled for Nov. 21-22, 2025. South Africa, the largest economy on the continent, has claimed neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war but continued to strengthen its economic and political ties with Moscow. The country is a member of the BRICS group alongside Russia, China, and others, and it even carried out joint naval drills with the two countries last year. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin over allegations of war crimes, specifically the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia following Moscow&apos;s invasion in early 2022. This forces the Russian leader to carefully select his travel destinations, as any country in the ICC must arrest him under the warrant. South Africa is a signatory of the ICC&apos;s Rome Statute. In November, Putin also chose not to travel to Brazil for the last G20 summit but sent his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in his place. The G20 group includes several countries that have fostered closer economic cooperation with Russia throughout its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including China and India. Putin visited Mongolia, a member of the ICC, in September of this year, where the Russian president received a warm welcome in Ulaanbaatar.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-africa-will-not-invite-putin-to-next-g20-summit/	2024-12-15T23:58:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1257512425.jpg
Trump's team seeks 'permanent end' to Russia-Ukraine war, national security advisor nominee says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team is discussing how to end the Russia-Ukraine war permanently rather than merely &quot;pausing&quot; it, Trump&apos;s pick for national security advisor, Mike Waltz, told CBS News on Dec. 15. Trump, taking on Jan. 20, 2025, said he aims to bring a swift end to the war without revealing specifics on how to achieve the goal. Some ideas floated with the president-elect&apos;s team reportedly include delaying Ukraine&apos;s entry into NATO in exchange for arms while freezing the war along the current front lines. &#xA0; When asked whether the upcoming Trump administration plans to restrict how Ukraine can use U.S. arms, Waltz said that a &quot;blank check... just isn&apos;t a strategy... This just, kind of, forever war that we seem to be backing into.&quot; Trump recently criticized the outgoing Biden administration&apos;s decision to permit Ukraine to strike targets within Russian territory with ATACMS missiles. At the same time, the president-elect indicated he does not plan to &quot;abandon&quot; Ukraine and instead leverage the U.S. assistance for Kyiv to push Russia to the negotiating table. &quot;What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who&apos;s at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table, and what&apos;s the framework for an agreement? Those are things that we&apos;re thinking through with his fantastic team that he&apos;s assembling,&quot; Waltz said. Waltz added that since Trump&apos;s reelection, his team has been in contact with European partners and Ukraine on how to end this war &quot;in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just a pause.&quot; Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Dec. 7 to discuss the ongoing war. Reuters reported that while the three did not discuss specifics of any concrete peace plan, Trump called for an immediate ceasefire, while Zelensky stressed the necessity of security guarantees. Trump also reportedly called for Europe to take greater responsibility in ensuring security once a ceasefire is reached. When asked about Trump&apos;s meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 9, Waltz noted that Hungary&apos;s leader &quot;has regular engagement with the Russians&quot; and &quot;a good relationship with President Trump.&quot; Trump&apos;s team will take a &quot;hard look&quot; at Orban&apos;s proposal for a Christmas truce as a &quot;first step&quot; to &quot;stop the fighting,&quot; Waltz added. Budapest claimed that Kyiv rejected a proposal for a Christmas truce and a prisoner exchange with Russia, while a Ukrainian official said that Hungary never discussed the idea with Ukraine. Orban has maintained warm ties with Russia throughout the full-scale war and criticized military support for Ukraine while also lauding Trump&apos;s reelection.	https://kyivindependent.com/waltz-on-ending-war-in-ukraine/	2024-12-15T23:21:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162467139.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 763,510 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 763,510 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Dec. 16. This number includes 1,070 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,563 tanks, 19,736 armored fighting vehicles, 31,480 vehicles and fuel tanks, 21,151 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,025 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 20,372 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-763-510-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-12-15T22:12:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Sinking of two Russian oil tankers may cause 'significant environmental impacts,' Greenpeace warns	The sinking of two Russian tankers in the Kerch Strait on Dec. 15 may cause &quot;significant&quot; environmental damage, Greenpeace Ukraine warned. The two tankers, which reportedly sank due to severe weather conditions, were carrying approximately 4,000 tons of fuel oil on board each. &quot;Any oil or petrochemical spill in these waters has the potential to be serious,&quot; the head of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, Dr. Paul Johnston said in a statement issued by Greenpeace Ukraine. &quot;If the ships sink, then there is the potential for releases of oil and petrochemicals over a longer time span.&quot; Johnston added that the type of oil spilled will make a difference to the environmental impact, with heavy residual fuel oils causing more visible damage than marine gas oils which tend to break up easier. It was not immediately clear as to what type of oil was spilled in the sinking of the tankers, which were originally built around 50 years ago and were hastily converted in the 1990s from full-fledged tankers to &quot;river-sea&quot; class vessels. &quot;If (the oil) is driven ashore, then it will cause fouling of the shoreline which will be extremely difficult to clean up,&quot; Johnson added. Greenpeace noted that a 2007 Russian oil tanker spill in the Black Sea, which release 1,200 tons of oil, resulted in &quot;severe&quot; environmental damage which was observed upwards of one year after the incident. Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has caused massive environmental damage, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam and subsequent flooding, widespread forest fires, and the devastation of wide stretches of farm land. According to a joint study conducted by Ukraine&apos;s Environment Ministry and climate NGOs released on June 13, the total damage associated with greenhouse gas emissions from the first two years of the full-scale invasion has exceeded $32 billion. That number does not include other types of environmental damage caused throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion which likely amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars. In October, the Kyiv School of Economics Institute warned that Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of old and poorly insured tankers pose significant environmental risks, as these often uninsured and aging vessels increase the danger of oil spills.	https://kyivindependent.com/sinking-of-two-russian-oil-tankers-may-cause-significant-environmental-impacts-greenpeace-warns/	2024-12-15T20:31:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1822474446.jpg
Peace cannot be achieved without territorial loss for Ukraine, Slovak president says	Slovak President Peter Pellegrini, speaking to Slovakia&apos;s public broadcaster STVR on Dec. 15, argued that achieving peace in Ukraine would likely require accepting partial territorial losses and called for the immediate start of peace negotiations. &quot;When it comes to peace, I believe that realism must be maintained. Today, probably no sensible person in Europe believes that peace can be achieved without some partial territorial losses for Ukraine,&quot; Pellegrini said. Pellegrini&apos;s comments come ahead of the January inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump who has vowed to get Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table for peace talks. Pellegrini has also previously indicated his objection to immediately providing Ukraine with an invite to the NATO military alliance, stating that immediate accession was &quot;not realistic&quot; during wartime. Pellegrini is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has been a vocal critic of military aid for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. On Dec. 2, the Russian-friendly, populist prime minister criticized the EU&#x2019;s new leadership over their supporting words for Ukraine, saying that the made by EU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas and new president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, &quot;did not correspond to the conclusions of the European Union.&quot; Fico halted military aid to Ukraine from the Slovak Armed Forces&apos; stocks after taking office in September 2023 in a stark foreign policy reversal.

Scholz's Social Democratic Party rejects sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine in election program, media reports	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SPD) reportedly rejected the delivery of Taurus missiles to Ukraine in the party&apos;s program for the upcoming February elections, the Berliner Morgenpost reported on Dec. 15, citing a leaked draft program. Scholz has long been adamant in his refusal to provide the country&#x2019;s Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine, even as other major backers of Ukraine, including the United States, have delivered long-range weaponry. Fearing it could draw his country into the war, Scholz has repeatedly refused Kyiv&apos;s request for the cruise missiles, with President Volodymyr Zelensky previously suggested that Germany&#x2019;s refusal to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles is linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s nuclear saber-rattling. &quot;We stand by Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s decision not to deliver the Taurus cruise missile from the Bundeswehr&apos;s stocks,&quot; the SPD program reportedly reads, adding that weapons deliveries should come with &quot;prudence and a sense of proportion.&quot; Despite the weapons refusal, the program also indicates that &quot;the SPD is clearly committed to diplomatic, military, financial and humanitarian support for the Ukrainians in their fight against Russian aggression, which is contrary to international law - for as long as necessary.&quot; The SPD&apos;s program comes in direct contrast with that of German Chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz&apos;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) who previously voiced support for providing Ukraine with the Taurus missiles. Merz, whose conservative CDU/CSU alliance is leading in the polls ahead of the Feb. 23 election, previously visited Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky, promising a more decisive strategy on long-range strikes against Russia. &quot;We want your army to be capable of hitting military bases in Russia. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,&quot; Merz said. Talking to Bild, Merz nevertheless said that the Swedish-German cruise missiles with a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles) would not be a &quot;miraculous&quot; game-changer in the war. The politician also stressed he agrees with Scholz that Germany must not become a party at war, but he pointed out that neither the U.K. nor the U.S. became belligerents when lifting restrictions on the weapons they provided. In the CDU&apos;s section of the election platform on foreign and security policy, the CDU has reportedly pledged to continue supporting Ukraine &quot;with all necessary diplomatic, financial, humanitarian, and military assistance.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/scholzs-social-democratic-party-election-program-rejects-sending-taurus-missiles-to-ukraine-media-reports/	2024-12-15T16:48:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2183251616-1.jpg
Pope Francis refers to Ukraine, Russia as 'brothers,' calls for peace during Sunday Mass	During Sunday prayer on Dec. 15, Pope Francis referred to Russia and Ukraine as &quot;brothers,&quot; while reiterating calls for peace in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. &quot;They are brothers, cousins. Let them come to an understanding. War is always a defeat. Peace to the whole world,&quot; the pope said during a visit to the French island of Corsica. As a precursor to Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has repeatedly framed its invasion as an effort to reunite the two nations as &quot;one people,&quot; relying on numerous false historical claims. In the lead-up to the invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked biblical imagery, describing the two countries as a &quot;brotherhood&quot; and comparing their relationship to that of Cain and Abel. The pope has earned a controversial reputation in Ukraine with his earlier remarks that relativized the responsibility of Russia&#x2019;s war, encouraging Ukrainians to have the &quot;courage&quot; to negotiate for peace. During his Sunday prayer on Dec. 8, Pope Francis called upon politicians and global leaders to bring about a ceasefire across the globe ahead of Christmas. His words came as Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is about to enter its third year, with 2024 marking the 10th anniversary of Russia&#x2019;s illegal occupation of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as the Crimean Peninsula. In October, Pope Francis met President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican to exchange symbolic gifts. Zelensky received a bronze bas-relief with a flower and an inscription, &quot;Peace is a fragile flower,&quot; while Pope Francis received a painting of the Bucha massacre. Chances that the Russian military would halt for Christmas appear slim as they gather speed in eastern Ukraine, ratcheting up their offensive operations before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/pope-francis-refers-to-ukraine-russia-as-brothers-calls-for-peace-during-sunday-mass/	2024-12-15T15:44:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1580497031.jpeg
Hundreds' of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in Kursk Oblast, ambassador says	In an interview with CBS News on Dec. 15, Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said that &quot;hundreds&quot; of North Korean troops are fighting alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast. &quot;We have seen hundreds of (North Korean soliders) on the battlefield already, and (Ukraine is) successfully fighting them as we are fighting with the Russians,&quot; Markarova told CBS News. &quot;We see them now in Kursk Oblast only, and our brave defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions.&quot; Markarova&apos;s statement come immediately after comments made by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 14 that a &quot;significant number&quot; of North Korean soldiers have begun fighting alongside Russian forces in assault operations in Kursk Oblast. &quot;We already have preliminary data that the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults &#x2014; a significant number of them,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address. Ukrainian and Western officials in fall 2024 warned that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The move represents an unprecedented escalation in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. The first clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. Zelensky reported on Dec. 1 that North Korean soldiers had already been killed fighting for Russia, but did not specify figures. Ukrainain forces launched a shock offensive into Kursk Oblast in August. Russia began a counterattack in September and has reportedly taken back 40% of the territory initially captured by Ukraine. During her interview with CBS News, Markarova called on more military aid as Pyongyang&apos;s and Moscow&apos;s relationship continues to strengthen. Moscow has continued to train thousands of North Korean soldiers on the battlefield with modern weaponry and equipment, while providing live combat experience. &quot;Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We&apos;re asking for the military support,&quot; Markarova said. &quot;It&apos;s still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense, most importantly, and the more we can have, the more efficiently we can defend.&quot; When asked whether the idea of a Christmas truce on the battlefield was possible, Markarova responded that &quot;if Russia wants to seriously stop (the war), they can stop it anytime.&quot; Moscow&apos;s losses on the battlefield continue to mount, with reported daily losses of well over a thousand troops in recent months.	https://kyivindependent.com/hundreds-of-north-korean-troops-fighting-alongside-russia-in-kursk-oblast-ambassador-says/	2024-12-15T15:29:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/markarova.jpg
Lithuania and Estonia introduce new sanctions against Georgian officials	Lithuania and Estonia have imposed sanctions against Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze and several government officials, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budris announced on X on Dec. 15. Lithuania expanded its sanctions list to include 17 individuals, while Estonia sanctioned 14 officials earlier that day. The Baltic states had previously imposed sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili, founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party, and members of the Interior Ministry for human rights violations. Similar actions have already been taken by the U.S., which on Dec. 12 announced visa bans on approximately 20 Georgian individuals accused of &quot;undermining democracy.&quot; &#x201C;Lithuania supports the people of Georgia and their European dream,&#x201D; Budris said. &quot;It is time for joint action at the EU level!&#x201D; Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsakhkna also posted about the sanctions on X. &quot;The violence perpetrated by the Georgian authorities against protesters, journalists &amp; opposition leaders is criminal and against human rights. I call on all EU countries to react &amp; to take actions,&quot; he wrote. The measures follow ongoing protests in Georgia, sparked by Kobakhidze&#x2019;s decision to suspend EU accession negotiations until 2028. Over 220 people have been arrested during the ensuing crackdown, with dozens reported injured as the Georgian police deployed tear gas and water cannons.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-and-estonia-introduce-new-sanctions-against-georgian-officials/	2024-12-15T11:47:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186867239.jpg
Ukraine war latest: North Korean troops joining Russian assaults in Kursk, Zelensky says	Key developments on Dec. 14-15: A &quot;significant number&quot; of North Korean soldiers have begun fighting alongside Russian forces in assault operations in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Dec. 14. Ukrainian and Western officials in fall 2024 warned that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The move represents an unprecedented escalation in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;Today, we already have preliminary data that the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults &#x2014; a significant number of them,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address. &quot;The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in Kursk Oblast.&quot; North Korean troops have not yet joined Russian forces in any other areas of the front, but this could change, Zelensky said. Zelensky also reported that North Korean units have sustained &quot;noticeable losses.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has &quot;dragged another state into this war,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;And if this is not escalation, then what is the escalation that so many have been talking about?&quot; The first clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. Zelensky reported on Dec. 1 that North Korean soldiers had already been killed fighting for Russia, but did not specify figures. Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened their alliance over the course of the full-scale war. The two nations signed a defense treaty in June, requiring either state to render military aid to the other in the event of an attack. North Korea has reportedly provided Russia with over 100 ballistic missiles and 5 million artillery shells. In exchange, Moscow has allegedly given Pyongyang economic support and assistance with its nuclear weapons program. Ukrainain forces launched a shock offensive into Kursk Oblast in August. Russia began a counterattack in September and has reportedly taken back 40% of the territory initially captured by Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence agencies destroyed a Russian train carrying 40 fuel tanks in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Dec. 14, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. The source said that the aim of the operation was to disrupt a supply line used to transport fuel from Crimea to Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The operation was carried out jointly by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Ukrainian army&apos;s Tavria Group, the Military Intelligence Agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces (SSO). The operation began with the SBU organizing a sabotage mission to destroy railroad tracks near the village of Oleksiivka in the Bilmak district, the source said. As the train carrying 40 fuel tanks was moving along the tracks, an explosion derailed the train, and some of the tanks ignited, according to the source. Using HIMARS rockets, the Ukrainian forces targeted the locomotive and the outermost cars, preventing Russian forces from ripping apart the tanks and saving some of the fuel. The operation resulted in the complete destruction of the locomotive and 40 fuel tanks, effectively crippling a key supply line to Russian forces in the region and rendering the targeted rail line inoperable, the source said. The operation follows another alleged operation by the Atesh partisan group, which said it had sabotaged a key railway in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Nov. 16, knocking out electrical equipment and disrupting Russia&apos;s military supply chain. Ukraine has been strengthening its defensive positions near the city of Zaporizhzhia in anticipation of a potential Russian offensive in the region. Local authorities, including the citys&apos; mayor, Oleksandr Fedorov, have confirmed the ongoing construction of multi-level fortifications designed to bolster the city&#x2019;s defense. This effort comes amid growing concerns over Russian military movements in the region. On Nov. 25, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine is closely monitoring Russian troop movements in southern Ukraine, noting that the threat of a renewed offensive remains high. The escalation in the south follows a broader trend of intense military activity, with Russia also concentrating its efforts along the eastern front. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces have been pushing aggressively toward key towns such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, aiming to break through Ukrainian defenses. A total of 292 combat clashes were recorded along the extensive eastern front line on Dec. 14, according to a new operational summary from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian forces continue their assaults employing diverse weaponry and tactics to strike Ukrainian positions, with a concentrated focus on Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. According to the report, Russian forces conducted one missile strike, utilizing two missiles aimed at Ukrainian unit positions and settlements. They also carried out 61 aviation strikes, involving 99 Controlled Aerial Bombs (KABs), over 5,000 artillery shelling incidents, including 158 rocket salvo system attacks, and deployed more than 3,000 kamikaze drones across various regions. In response, the Defense Forces conducted 35 targeted strikes against Russian troop concentrations, armaments, and military equipment. These efforts resulted in the destruction of one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control point, three artillery systems, and two air defense systems. Ukrainian forces successfully defended their positions and repelled numerous enemy attacks across multiple regions, including Kupiansk, Lyman, and Pokrovsk. In these areas, Ukrainian defenders thwarted 52 attacks. Other key locations, such as Toretsk, Kurakhiv, Kramatorsk, and Siversk, also saw significant resistance. Despite these official updates, Stanislav Buniatov, a platoon commander of the 24th Separate Assault Battalion Aidar, expressed concerns about the situation in Kurakhiv on his Telegram channel, stating, &quot;The advantage in manpower and firepower is multiple; in such conditions, it is very difficult, one might say unrealistic, to hold defense in dense construction.&quot; These concerns were echoed by DeepState, which reported on its Telegram channel that, as of Dec. 15, Russian forces had captured the city council in Kurakhiv and raised their flag over it. In the northern areas of Volynsk and Polisk, the operational situation remains stable, with no signs of offensive group formations by Russian forces. The situation on Dec. 15 showed a slight intensification in combat compared to the previous day, according to data shared by the General Staff. The number of combat clashes increased from 205 to 292, and Russian airstrikes rose from 38 on Dec. 13 to 61 on Dec. 14. These updates follow reports of a dire situation near Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, as Russian forces continue to gain ground, putting additional pressure on Ukrainian defenses. Recent reports indicate that Russian troops have successfully advanced to key locations, and Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold the line against a well-equipped and larger Russian military, despite efforts to recapture lost positions. Two Russian tankers have suffered significant damage in the Kerch Strait due to severe weather conditions and have already sunk, Russian media outlets Mash and Baza reported on Dec. 15. Russia&apos;s Emergency Situations Ministry also reported that the tankers, Volgoneft 212 and Volgoneft 239, had been damaged. Both vessels were carrying approximately 4,000 tons of fuel oil on board each, according to Baza. The Volgoneft 212 has 13 crew members aboard, while the Volgoneft 239 has 14. Both crews have requested assistance. In response, Russia&apos;s Emergency Situations Ministry stated that a Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers was deployed and that 13 sailors were evacuated from the Volgoneft-212, but one of them had died. The ministry has primarily focused on ongoing rescue operations, offering few details on the current condition of the tankers. According to eyewitness accounts reported by Mash, the Volgoneft-212 was cut in half by waves near the coast of Kerch, while the Volgoneft-139 sank within minutes after waves created a hole in the hull, causing a crack that split the ship in two. Mash reported that both tankers were built around 50 years ago and were hastily converted in the 1990s from full-fledged tankers to &quot;river-sea&quot; class vessels. The rushed modifications included cutting the ships in half, discarding the center, and welding the bow and stern together, leaving a large seam that failed under the impact of powerful waves. This seam ultimately split apart, contributing to the vessels&#x2019; sinking. Baza reported that investigators have opened two criminal cases following the sinking of the tankers, though this has not been confirmed by official sources. Russian-occupied Crimea is home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet but successful Ukrainian strikes on Crimea have forced Moscow to relocate much of its naval forces from the peninsula to the Russian port city of Novorossiysk. Ukraine has repeatedly struck Russia&apos;s vessels since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Around 30% of Russia&#x2019;s Black Sea Fleet is lost or disabled, according to the Ukrainian military. North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast killed eight members of a Russian unit in a &quot;friendly fire&quot; attack, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) claimed on Dec. 14. Earlier in the day, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that a &quot;significant number&quot; of North Korean troops had joined Russian assault operations in the Kursk region. While engaged in combat in Kursk Oblast, a group of North Korean soldiers opened fire on members of the Chechen Akhmat unit fighting for Russia, HUR reported via its official Telegram channel. The attack allegedly killed eight Russian soldiers. The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the report. HUR said the incident was the result of the language barrier between Russian and North Korean troops, which continues to be a &quot;difficult obstacle&quot; on the battlefield. An estimated 200 servicemembers fighting with Russian and North Korean units have been killed as of Dec. 14, HUR claimed. Zelensky previously announced that North Korean personnel had begun incurring &quot;noticeable losses,&quot; but did not provide a figure. Ukrainian and Western officials in fall 2024 warned that over 10,000 North Korean troops had amassed in Kursk Oblast, ready to aid Russia&apos;s attempt to oust Ukrainian forces in the region. The Russian military has instituted special protocols in places where North Korean personnel are located, HUR said. Russian soldiers must undergo inspections before entering these areas, and their phones and electronic devices are confiscated. The first direct clashes between North Korean and Ukrainian troops in Kursk Oblast were reported in early November. According to Zelensky, North Korean personnel have not been deployed to any other areas of the front, but that could change in the future. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-north-korean-troops-joining-russian-assaults-in-kursk-zelensky-says/	2024-12-15T11:14:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Trump picks former intelligence director Richard Grenell as 'envoy for special missions'	Richard Grenell, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, will serve as President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;special missions envoy,&quot; Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Dec. 14. In his post, Trump stated that &#x201C;Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea [and] ... will continue to fight for Peace through Strength, and always put America first.&#x201D; The New York Times describes Grenell as &#x201C;a loyalist known for unbridled social media attacks on Mr. Trump&#x2019;s perceived critics.&quot; He previously served as U.S. Ambassador to Germany during Trump&#x2019;s first term, as acting National Intelligence Director in 2020, and as Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations from 2019 to 2021. Grenell&#x2019;s name emerged during Trump&#x2019;s selection process for the U.S. Ukraine peace envoy, where he was a prominent contender, though the role ultimately went to Keith Kellogg. Michael O&#x2019;Hanlon, director of research in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv Independent that he was &#x201C;more hopeful&#x201D; about Kellogg&#x2019;s selection, contrasting him with Grenell, whom he described as more radical. Ukrainian analyst Volodymyr Fesenko agreed, noting that &#x201C;Grenell is more radical and more inclined to apply strong pressure [to Ukraine].&#x201D; Grenell&apos;s perspective on Ukraine is consistent with the &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach, which involves leveraging military power, economic pressure, and assertive diplomacy to deter aggression and secure peace, as Trump&apos;s advisor Robert C. O&#x2019;Brien elaborated in Foreign Affairs in June 2024. &#xA0; In 2022, he &#x201C;applauded&#x201D; Elon Musk&#x2019;s controversial peace proposal but called for an even &#x201C;stronger [peace] deal.&#x201D; Musk&#x2019;s plan, which proposed Ukraine&#x2019;s neutrality, recognition of Crimea as Russian, and a UN-supervised vote on other occupied territories, ignited widespread criticism. By July 2024, Grenell suggested that peace in Ukraine could involve creating &#x201C;autonomous zones,&#x201D; though he did not provide details. &#x201C;Autonomous regions can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but you got to work through those details,&#x201D; he said. Grenell also expressed the belief that Ukraine should delay its NATO membership ambitions. It remains unclear what priorities and actions this newly created role will entail, as it currently has no established precedent.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-picks-former-intelligence-director-richard-grenell-as-envoy-for-special-missions/	2024-12-15T09:36:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2173291826.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a shortened on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Dec. 16 to Dec. 22. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. Central banks accounting for over 40% of the world&#x2019;s economy will set rates next week &#x2013; incl. a possible record hike in Russia. With inflation expected to reach 9% in 2024 and pressure on the ruble, analysts now expect the Russian Central Bank to increase rates to a record 23% (up 200 basis points). Much of the world is dealing with combinations of low growth, high debt, budget deficits and the fallout of politically destabilizing inflation &#x2013; potentially making macroeconomics a surprise 2025 geopolitical driver. The biggest central bank, the US Federal Reserve, faces uncertainty between a booming economy and highly inflationary Trump tariff plans. It is expected to modestly cut rates (25 basis points) on Wednesday, Dec. 18.The Verkhovna Rada&apos;s final plenary week of the year will take place Dec. 17&#x2013;20. A significant focus will be the first reading of the bill addressing the construction of Units 3 and 4 at the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko is strongly advocating for this construction project. Additionally, lawmakers will consider legislation on multiple citizenships. The presidential election campaign in Croatia is underway, with the first round set for Dec. 29. Current polls show incumbent President Zoran Milanovi&#x107; leading at 35%, while Dragan Primorac holds second place with 24.5%. Maria Selak Raspudi&#x107; trails significantly in third place at 8%. Milanovi&#x107;, known for his pro-Putin stance, advocates for Croatia&apos;s withdrawal from both the EU and NATO. While Primorac, the former Minister of Education and Science, has a viable path to victory through his nomination by the ruling HDZ party and its allies, his campaign&apos;s low visibility and limited political profile may hinder his chances. The dismissal of Ukrainian Institute of National Memory head Anton Drobovych may move forward talks on Volyn exhumations &#x2013; a key source of Polish-Ukrainian tensions. Drobovych often frustrated Poles, most recently claiming Poland had not delivered a list of locations for exhumation work (shortly after a significant communique by Foreign Ministers Andrii Sybiha and Rados&#x142;aw Sikorski seemed to resolve the matter). The issue remains complex, notably given Polish presidential elections next year (and possibly in Ukraine).

Zelensky rejected opportunity to discuss Christmas truce with Orban, Hungarian minister claims	President Volodymyr Zelensky has &quot;forcefully but politely&quot; rejected a call from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n to discuss a Christmas ceasefire, Hungarian Foreign Minister P&#xE9;ter Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3; claimed on Dec. 15. He said that Hungary had proposed organizing a telephone conversation between Zelensky and Orban on the issue but Zelensky had not accepted the proposal. Zelensky&apos;s spokesman Serhiy Nikiforov did not respond to a request for comment. Hungary has maintained close economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow despite Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It has repeatedly criticized EU sanctions against Russia and obstructed efforts to provide military aid to Kyiv. Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3;, quoted by Hungarian news agency MTI, said that the Hungarian peace mission had &quot;tried everything in the past six months&quot; in connection with a proposed Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange in Ukraine. &quot;Christmas is approaching, and when we talk about Christmas, peace gets special emphasis, which is why Hungarian diplomacy - with the prime minister surely taking the lead - took some serious steps recently in order to improve the situation for people living in the affected area, even before the war finally ends,&quot; he first said to MTI on Dec 13. &quot;We have therefore proposed a Christmas ceasefire and a large exchange of prisoners, so that more people can celebrate Christmas at home and in peace even in that part of the world.&quot; The foreign minister said that the Hungarian government presented this proposal to Russian President Vladimir Putin and and to several Russian government officials who allegedly demonstrated &quot;an openness to considering the proposal and carrying out the related talks.&quot; Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3;, however, explained on Dec. 15 that Zelensky had, &quot;in a gesture that is quite unprecedented in diplomacy, forcefully but politely refused the opportunity to negotiate.&quot; &quot;There is an offer on the table that has not been comparable in the past thousand days. It is not up to Hungary whether both parties consider and accept this offer. One party has considered it and finds it suitable for acceptance, but the other party has taken a position of rejection,&quot; he stated. Szijj&#xE1;rt&#xF3;&apos;s statement follows a parallel one by the Hungarian Head of the Prime Minister&apos;s Office Gergely Gulyas. He said on Dec. 12 that Hungary would not give up the goal of a cease-fire, &quot;even though the current Ukrainian government is apparently uncertain about the issue of war and peace, at least until the new U.S. president takes office.&quot; This topic has been in the spotlight since Hungarian Prime Minister Orb&#xE1;n said on his X profile on Dec. 11 that Budapest had proposed a ceasefire. &quot;It&apos;s sad that President Zelensky clearly rejected and ruled out this today,&quot; he said. &quot;We did what we could!&quot; But Dmytro Lytvyn, an advisor for Zelensky, told Suspline that denied the claim that Orban had approached Ukraine with his ceasefire and prisoner exchange proposal. Guly&#xE1;s mentioned on Dec. 12 that Orb&#xE1;n had met with Pope Francis in the Vatican and President-elect Donald Trump in Florida, as well as held phone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo&#x11F;an, but he made no reference to any talks with Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-rejected-the-opportunity-to-negotiate-christmas-truce-hungary-foreign-minister-says/	2024-12-15T08:46:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GSH76_oXwAAKjOP.jpeg

Ukraine destroys Russian train with 40 fuel tanks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, source claims	Ukrainian intelligence agencies have destroyed a Russian train carrying 40 fuel tanks in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Dec. 14, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. The source said that the aim of the operation was to disrupt a supply line used to transport fuel from Crimea to Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The operation was carried out jointly by the the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Ukrainian army&apos;s Tavria Group, the Military Intelligence Agency (HUR), and the Special Operations Forces (SSO). &#xA0; The operation began with the SBU organizing a sabotage mission to destroy railroad tracks near the village of Oleksiivka in the Bilmak district, the source said. As the train carrying 40 fuel tanks was moving along the tracks, an explosion derailed the train, and some of the tanks ignited, according to the source. Using HIMARS rockets, the Ukrainian forces targeted the locomotive and the outermost cars, preventing Russian forces from ripping apart the tanks and saving some of the fuel. The operation resulted in the complete destruction of the locomotive and 40 fuel tanks, effectively crippling a key supply line to Russian forces in the region and rendering the targeted rail line inoperable, the source said. The operation follows another alleged operation by the Atesh partisan group, which said it had sabotaged a key railway in Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Nov. 16, knocking out electrical equipment and disrupting Russia&apos;s military supply chain. Ukraine has been strengthening its defensive positions near the city of Zaporizhzhia in anticipation of a potential Russian offensive in the region. Local authorities, including the citys&apos; mayor, Oleksandr Fedorov, have confirmed the ongoing construction of multi-level fortifications designed to bolster the city&#x2019;s defense. This effort comes amid growing concerns over Russian military movements in the region. On Nov. 25, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine is closely monitoring Russian troop movements in southern Ukraine, noting that the threat of a renewed offensive remains high. The escalation in the south follows a broader trend of intense military activity, with Russia also concentrating its efforts along the eastern front. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian forces have been pushing aggressively toward key towns such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, aiming to break through Ukrainian defenses.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-dorces-disrupt-key-russian-fuel-supply-line-in-zaporizhzhia/	2024-12-15T04:54:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-1861106363.jpg
Georgia's opposition parties appeal to EU following election of pro-Russian president, Sova reports	Georgia&apos;s opposition leaders have urged the EU to reject the pro-Russian presidential candidate and take broader steps to support European values in the country, Sova news outlet reports. In their joint letter, addressed to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, and the foreign ministers of EU member states, the opposition leaders express their concerns. The letter was signed by Nika Melia of the &#x201C;Coalition for Change,&#x201D; Tina Bokuchava of &#x201C;Unity &#x2013; National Movement,&#x201D; Mamuka Khazaradze of &#x201C;Strong Georgia,&#x201D; and Zaza Tavadze of &#x201C;Gakharia for Georgia.&#x201D; The leaders argue that the only solution to the current crisis is &quot;to hold new elections under an improved electoral system, with a politically balanced electoral administration and neutral state institutions.&quot; The letter also criticizes Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of Georgian Dream, for his plan to elect Mikhail Kavelashvili as the sixth president of Georgia, calling it a move that exacerbates the already tense situation. The authors remind the EU that Kavelashvili was one of the initiators of the controversial foreign agents law and is frequently involved in anti-Western propaganda. They urge the EU to take urgent measures to support the Georgian people and protect European values. These measures include the release of all detained politicians, activists, and peaceful demonstrators; the introduction of targeted sanctions against those responsible for &quot;undermining democracy;&quot; the suspension of visa-free travel and visa restrictions for Georgian Dream officials; and the declaration of the &quot;self-proclaimed regime&quot; of Ivanishvili as illegitimate. Similar actions have already been taken by the U.S., which on Dec. 12 announced visa bans on approximately 20 Georgian individuals accused of &quot;undermining democracy.&quot; The opposition leaders emphasize that the Georgian people are &quot;courageously resisting Russian-backed authoritarianism and fighting for their democratic European future.&quot; They stress that EU support is vital to their success, stating, &quot;Your clear voice, together with decisive action, will play a crucial role in de-escalating the alarming situation in Georgia and restoring constitutional order.&quot; Protests have erupted in Georgia against the ruling Georgian Dream party, fueled by accusations of democratic backsliding and alignment with Russian interests. The party&apos;s suspension of Georgia&apos;s EU accession process until at least 2028 and allegations of election violations, including restrictions on overseas voting, have intensified public outrage. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU leader, has criticized these actions and vowed to remain in office until a legitimate parliament is elected. President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Zourabichvili on Dec. 7 and to expressed solidarity with the Georgian people, condemning the Ivanishvili-led government for undermining Georgia&apos;s democratic aspirations. He also emphasized the importance of international backing for Georgia&#x2019;s fight for democracy.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgias-opposition-parties-appeal-to-eu-following-election-of-pro-russian-president-sova-reports/	2024-12-15T02:33:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2186926312.jpg
292 front-line clashes recorded over the past day, General Staff reports	A total of 292 combat clashes were recorded along the extensive eastern front line on Dec. 14, according to a new operational summary from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian forces continue their assaults employing diverse weaponry and tactics to strike Ukrainian positions, with a concentrated focus on Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. According to the report, Russian forces conducted one missile strike, utilizing two missiles aimed at Ukrainian unit positions and settlements. They also carried out 61 aviation strikes, involving 99 Controlled Aerial Bombs (KABs), over 5,000 artillery shelling incidents, including 158 rocket salvo system attacks, and deployed more than 3,000 kamikaze drones across various regions. In response, the Defense Forces conducted 35 targeted strikes against Russian troop concentrations, armaments, and military equipment. These efforts resulted in the destruction of one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control point, three artillery systems, and two air defense systems. Ukrainian forces successfully defended their positions and repelled numerous enemy attacks across multiple regions, including Kupiansk, Lyman, and Pokrovsk. In these areas, Ukrainian defenders thwarted 52 attacks. Other key locations, such as Toretsk, Kurakhiv, Kramatorsk, and Siversk, also saw significant resistance. Despite these official updates, Stanislav Buniatov, a platoon commander of the 24th Separate Assault Battalion Aidar, expressed concerns about the situation in Kurakhiv on his Telegram channel, stating, &quot;The advantage in manpower and firepower is multiple; in such conditions, it is very difficult, one might say unrealistic, to hold defense in dense construction.&quot; These concerns were echoed by DeepState, which reported on its Telegram channel that, as of Dec. 15, Russian forces had captured the city council in Kurakhiv and raised their flag over it. In the northern areas of Volynsk and Polisk, the operational situation remains stable, with no signs of offensive group formations by Russian forces. The situation on Dec. 15 showed a slight intensification in combat compared to the previous day, according to data shared by the General Staff. The number of combat clashes increased from 205 to 292, and Russian airstrikes rose from 38 on Dec. 13 to 61 on Dec. 14. These updates follow reports of a dire situation near Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, as Russian forces continue to gain ground, putting additional pressure on Ukrainian defenses. Recent reports indicate that Russian troops have successfully advanced to key locations, and Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold the line against a well-equipped and larger Russian military, despite efforts to recapture lost positions.	https://kyivindependent.com/292-combat-clashes-recorded-at-the-front-general-staff-reports/	2024-12-15T02:07:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/12/GettyImages-2166525576-1.jpg
