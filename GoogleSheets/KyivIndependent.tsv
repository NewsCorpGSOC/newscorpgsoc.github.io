Ukraine war latest: Russian mass airstrike on Zaporizhzhia kills 4, injures over 30	Key developments on Nov. 7: Russian forces attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia on Nov. 7, killing four people and injuring at least 33 others, local authorities reported. Russia struck Zaporizhzhia five times using guided aerial bombs. The attack partially destroyed an apartment building and houses, and damaged a cancer hospital, according to the statement. A four-month-old girl and two boys aged one and 10 are among the injured, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. The number of casualties can increase as the search and rescue operation is ongoing. Following the attack, President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Kyiv&apos;s partners to provide Ukraine with more air defense systems and to lift restrictions on strikes with Western long-range weapons on targets deep inside Russia. &quot;Each such Russian strike not only kills people and destroys lives, but also destroys the meaning of any words about the lack of conversations with Russia, phone calls to the Kremlin,&quot; he added. The aftermath of a Russian attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on Nov. 7, 2024. (State Emergency Service)Ukraine may have targeted Iranian weapon supply routes in Dagestan strike, media suggestsUkrainian forces may have targeted routes in Dagestan used by Iran to supply weapons to Russia, the War Zone media outlet reported on Nov. 6. Dagestan authorities reported intercepting a drone attack over Kaspiysk, a port city at the Caspian Sea around 1,000 kilometers from the front line (600 miles), on the morning of Nov. 6. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence was behind the attack, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. In the first Ukrainian attack against a naval base in Dagestan, at least two vessels &#x2014; missile ships Tatarstan and Dagestan &#x2014; were damaged in the attack, and possibly also several small Project 21631 ships, according to the source. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Although the precise consequences of the Ukrainian attack are difficult to establish, the recent strike is still &quot;significant in several ways,&quot; the War Zone&apos;s experts said. The port in Dagestan is not only a base for the Russian Caspian Flotilla and several military units of the Russian Armed Forces but is also located along the routes used by Iran to deliver weapons to Russia. Until the recent Ukrainian attack, this route was considered safe for transportation due to being supposedly out of the range of Ukrainian weapons. While Russian authorities claimed to have intercepted a single drone in the skies, a video shared on social media appears to show another drone hitting its target, resulting in a large explosion. The incident took place roughly 15 kilometers (10 miles) from a local airport, the Mash news channel claimed, identifying the drone as a Ukrainian A-22 Flying Fox drone. The nearby Makhachkala airport has suspended operations for an indefinite period due to the incident, local authorities said. South Korea does not rule out providing arms to Ukraine in the light of deepening cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a press conference on Nov. 7. &quot;Now, depending on the level of North Korean involvement, we will gradually adjust our support strategy in phases,&quot; Yoon told the media. &quot;This means we are not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons.&quot; Russian-North Korean ties entered a new level when Pyongyang dispatched around 12,000 troops to join Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Yoon said previously that Seoul might revise its ban on supplying direct military assistance to a war zone in response. South Korea has provided Ukraine with humanitarian and non-lethal aid but refused to provide weapons, citing legislative restrictions. Some media reports from last year claimed that the country secretly supplied artillery shells to Ukraine via the U.S., though the South Korean government denied the reports. It remains unclear what weapons South Korea is considering, though Yoon commented that &quot;defensive weapons&quot; would be a priority. A source in South Korea&apos;s Presidential Office told the Yonhap news agency that a direct supply of 155 mm artillery shells is currently not on the table. Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Nov. 7, striking a residential building in the capital, the Kyiv City Military Administration reported. According to the military administration, the drone strike caused &quot;significant damage&quot; to a unit in the apartment building in the Holosiivskyi district of the city. The military administration also reported a large fire nearby caused by falling drone debris at an auto repair shop. Multiple explosions were heard in the outskirts of Kyiv around 1 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned throughout the night that Russian attack drones were in the vicinity of the city. Around 6 a.m. local time, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted on Telegram that wreckage also fell in the Pechersk district and caused a fire on the 33rd floor of a residential building. The fire was contained shortly after. Wreckage from the ongoing attack has also fallen in the Podil district, where a two-story house caught fire, in the Obolon district, where a business center caught fire on the upper floors, and in the Solomianskyi district, where debris fell both in a yard of a private home and onto a private medical facility. One person was hospitalized in the Solomianskyi district following the attack. No further details are currently available. The most recent attack is the latest in a series of drone strikes targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine&#x2019;s capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-40/	2024-11-07T12:57:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-07-22_07_41.jpg
German aid for Ukraine in 2025 safe despite coalition collapse, Reuters reports	Germany will be able to provide most of the 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) promised to Ukraine, even if the 2025 budget is not approved in time due to the coalition collapse, Reuters reported on Nov. 7, citing unnamed sources from the budget committee. Germany&apos;s three-party governing coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that he had dismissed Finance Minister Christian Lindner. Such a move will likely propel the country into a snap election in the near term, as it is unlikely that Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SDP) will have enough votes to pass next year&apos;s budget. The funds for Ukraine are mainly committed appropriations and can be allocated under provisional budget management if the budget is not passed, four sources told Reuters. The likely delay in the budget means no spending on new projects, although some expenses, such as increased aid to Ukraine, may still pass. In February, Germany&apos;s parliament approved the country&apos;s budget for this year, including 7.6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in military assistance for Kyiv. According to the draft of the 2025 budget, the aid was cut by half, Reuters reported. Scholz reportedly wanted to increase the support package for Ukraine to 15 billion euros ($16.1 billion) and finance it by suspending the debt brake, a law that limits borrowing, government sources told Reuters. Scholz partly justified Lindner&apos;s dismissal by saying that he had asked the minister to relax spending rules to allow increased aid for Ukraine, but Lindner refused. Initially criticized for its sluggish delivery of military aid to Ukraine following the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Berlin has become the second-largest provider of military equipment after the U.S.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-aid-for-ukraine-in-2025-safe-despite-coallition-collapse-reuters-reports/	2024-11-07T11:52:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1703764954.jpg
Putin congratulates Trump on US election victory, says he is 'ready to have discussions'	Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election during the Valdai forum in Sochi on Nov. 7. Putin said he is ready &quot;to have discussions&quot; with Trump. &#x201C;What (Trump) said in terms of seeking to restore relations with Russia, to help bring the &apos;Ukrainian crisis&apos; to an end, I think is noteworthy at least,&#x201D; Putin said. Trump claimed victory in a presidential vote on Nov. 6, defeating his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. The election is expected to have a profound impact on Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, as some worry Trump might seek to cut a deal with Putin at the cost of painful concessions by Kyiv. Russian officials offered mixed responses to Trump&apos;s victory. While some were cautiously optimistic about a possible decrease in support for Ukraine, others said they don&apos;t expect Washington&apos;s foreign policy to change fundamentally. The Russian independent news outlet Verstka reported on Nov. 6 that Putin had congratulated Trump &quot;through acquaintances&quot; instead of an official phone call. Putin claimed indifference to the result of the vote and once even said he would prefer Harris as a president in an apparent wry remark, while U.S. intelligence has accused Russia of election interference to boost Trump&apos;s support. Trump has repeatedly backed and praised Putin. He described Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine as &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;savvy&quot; in 2022. Later, Trump blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Joe Biden for Moscow&apos;s all-out war. According to journalist Bob Woodward&apos;s new book, Trump secretly spoke with Putin as many as seven times after he left office. Zelensky was among the first to congratulate Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election, voicing hopes for &quot;strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.&quot; The two also had a follow-up phone call, agreeing to strengthen cooperation, Ukraine&apos;s president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-congratulates-trump-on-us-election-victory/	2024-11-07T11:32:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179875820.jpg
‘Aid will either increase or stop altogether’ – Ukrainians in US react to Trump’s comeback	In a remarkable comeback that saw Donald Trump win the electoral college and popular vote in the Nov. 5 election, the 78-year-old conservative will take office on Jan. 20 more powerful than ever, with Republican control of the Senate and possibly the House of Representatives. While Trump&#x2019;s pre-election campaign was largely focused on domestic issues, concern has loomed in Kyiv about Trump&#x2019;s return due to his criticism of U.S. military assistance for Ukraine, whose army continues battling Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion for a third year now. Trump&#x2019;s promise to swiftly end the war, his history of fancy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and routine election campaign criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also fuel worry that he will pressure Kyiv into accepting a peace agreement that would involve ceding some of 20% of state territory currently occupied by Russia. &quot;They said &#x2018;he will start a war.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m not going to start a war,&#x201D; Trump said in a victory speech early in the morning of Nov. 6, adding &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to stop the wars.&quot; After asking Ukrainians in Kyiv, soldiers, and politicians for their reaction to Trump&#x2019;s victory, the Kyiv Independent has turned to Ukrainians in the U.S. to respond to what they make of Trump&#x2019;s now-certain return to the White House. Mykola Melnyk, a 39-year-old officer in Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces who served as a company commander of the 47th Mechanized Brigade, has been in the U.S. for months, receiving treatment for injuries he sustained during the 2023 counteroffensive in southern Ukraine. &#x201C;Everyone knows that it will not be like under (outgoing U.S. President Joe) Biden when aid kept flowing but slowly and diminishing,&#x201D; Melnyk said. &#x201C;Now Ukraine aid will either increase or stop altogether.&#x201D; For Melnyk, Trump has contradicted himself so many times in his statements on Russia and Putin that he isn&#x2019;t sure what is ahead for Ukraine. &#x201C;Trump is hostage to his voters,&#x201D; Melnyk said. &#x201C;His voters want to return the U.S. to its greatness and actually putting Putin in his place might be an option for Trump to satisfy his voters.&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (R) meet in New York during the visit to the United States in New York City, U.S. on Sept. 27, 2024. (Uliana Boichuk/Novyny LIVE/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Dara LesniakDara Lesniak is an active member of New York City&#x2019;s Ukrainian community who spent the months preceding the election advocating for U.S. support of a Ukrainian victory. She is the president of the Ukrainian Club at Columbia University. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not surprised by the election results, but I am worried for Ukraine&#x2019;s future,&#x201D; Lesniak said. &#x201C;While Trump&#x2019;s policy position on the war in Ukraine has been unclear throughout the whole campaign, as we came closer to election day, Trump&#x2019;s rhetoric on the issue became more concerning,&#x201D; Lesniak said. &#x201C;His refusal to say he wanted Ukraine to win in the presidential debate was particularly concerning.&#x201D; Lesniak said there is so much uncertainty with Trump, but the turning point for her was his selection of JD Vance to be America&#x2019;s next vice president. She said it&#x2019;s not clear to what extent Trump shares the isolationist views of Vance, but the former and future president&#x2019;s actions suggest his administration will head toward Vance&#x2019;s seclusion. &#xA0; Lesniak said she heard from many Ukrainians who fear Trump&#x2019;s presidency will reduce the amount of U.S. aid sent to Ukraine. Despite this, Lesniak is holding onto a bit of optimism. &#x201C;I believe there is hope in that we as advocates for Ukrainian victory will have to double down on our efforts next year.&#x201D; Taras Mahlay, a medical professional and the board president of the Cleveland Maidan Association, a nonprofit providing aid to Ukraine, is concerned about the loss of life in Ukraine due to Russia&#x2019;s war and the unpredictability of Trump&#x2019;s future administration. As someone who organizes aid sent to Ukraine, Mahlay is worried about war fatigue and how it may affect America&#x2019;s willingness to donate money and resources to efforts like his to support Ukraine. He wants to see an administration that continues to send humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine but is uncertain if Trump will. Mahlay is worried that Trump&#x2019;s plan to end the war in Ukraine rapidly involves ceding Ukrainian territory and that his understanding of that is only through the lens of land lost, not human suffering. &#x201C;If we stop the war and leave the borders as is right now, what happens to the people behind the curtain? That&apos;s my concern,&#x201D; Mahlay said. &#x201C;If it was a simple thing about giving up the land, I think we just give up the land (but) it&#x2019;s the people, it&#x2019;s our culture, it&#x2019;s everything that&#x2019;s there besides the physical land.&#x201D; Mahlay said he was anxious about what is to come under Trump, not just for Ukraine but for the world.

Trump&#x2019;s victory will have repercussions beyond Ukraine, she said. &#x201C;Sadly, it is not only bad news for Ukraine, but also for our children and grandchildren who will bear the heavy consequences of this decision in the future.&#x201D; For Andriy Boechko, a Parma, Ohio resident who moved from Lviv, western Ukraine, in the 1990s, there is a feeling of uncertainty following Trump&#x2019;s victory. &#x201C;Trump never actually presented any foreign policy plans &#x2013; just some vague ideas,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;He also has a history of flip-flopping on major issues.&#x201D; A registered independent, Boechko voted for Kamala Harris believing that she would have been better for Ukraine. Now, he&#x2019;s accepted a position of remaining cautiously optimistic. &#x201C;I do think that Trump is more decisive and he does have people on his team that are supportive of Ukraine.&#x201D; For the resident of a robust Ukrainian community in northeast Ohio &#x2013; one of the largest Ukrainian diaspora concentrations in the country &#x2013; nothing will change, he says. &#x201C;I will continue doing my part in helping Ukraine,&#x201D; Boechko said. &#x201C;It is the responsibility of every Ukrainian to do so.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/aid-will-either-increase-or-stop-altogether-ukrainians-in-us-react-to-trumps-comeback/	2024-11-07T11:12:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Mykola-Melnyk---Linda.jpg
Metro Awakening VR release expands famous Ukrainian post-apocalyptic game franchise	Metro Awakening, the fourth video game in the popular Ukrainian-born post-apocalyptic survival franchise set in Russia&#x2019;s underground subway, was released on Nov. 7 by the virtual reality (VR) company Vertigo Games. Players begin the first-person shooter game as a doctor in search of his wife after a nuclear apocalypse in the near future. In what may be one of the few remaining public collaborations between Ukrainians and Russians in the creative industries, exiled Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky, whose novels formed the basis of the franchise, contributed to scripting this standalone prequel. The first three games in the series &#x2014; Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light, and Metro: Exodus &#x2014; were developed by Ukrainian company 4A Games. 4A Games and Netherlands-based Vertigo Games share a parent company, Embracer Group. While Metro Awakening was developed by Vertigo Games, 4A Games provided resources from previous games to aid development, according to Metro Awakening&#x2019;s creative director. A subsidiary of Embracer Group said in February that 4A Games is working on a non-VR game in the franchise, though there is no scheduled release date. Before the full-scale invasion, 4A Games had already moved many of its operations to Malta following Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Crimea but has maintained a significant presence in Kyiv. Some of its employees have lost homes in Russian attacks, while others now serve in the Armed Forces, the company wrote on its website last year. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve never hidden the fact that the Metro series has always carried a strong political and anti-war message,&#x201D; the company wrote. &#x201C;And the war in Ukraine has made us re-think what kind of story the next Metro should be about. All the themes of Metro &#x2013; conflict, power, politics, tyranny, repression &#x2013; are now part of our daily-life experiences.&#x201D; Glukhovsky, a famous Russian author, is living in exile after Russia sentenced him to 8 years in prison last year. Glukhovsky was found guilty of posting online that Russian servicemen were committing crimes in Ukraine, which prosecutors said was false information. Russia outlawed spreading what it calls fake information about the war after it began its full-scale invasion and has used this law to crack down on dissidents and journalists. Shortly after the invasion, Glukhovsky condemned the war from outside Russia, writing that the war &#x201C;unleashed by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is becoming more terrible and inhuman every day, and the pretexts under which it was started look more and more insignificant and false.&#x201D; A screenshot from Metro Awakening (Vertigo Games)He has continued to speak out against the war, calling it a &#x201C;monstrous unjust war by a tyrant who just wanted to preserve power and make history&#x201D; on Instagram last year. &#xA0; &#x201C;I still demand from the Russian authorities to immediately stop this senseless and futile anti-national war and to withdraw troops from the territory of Ukraine,&#x201D; Glukhovsky wrote. Ahead of Metro Awakening&#x2019;s release, Glukhovsky told the video game outlet Polygon, &#x201C;The Metro books and the video games, they all have this anti-war, pacifist, anti-dictatorship political message.&#x201D; &#x201C;From Metro 2033 to Metro: Last Light and Exodus, it&apos;s all about xenophobia. It&apos;s about manipulation from the state, from the government. It&apos;s about how governments push us into global conflicts,&#x201D; Glukhovsky said. The games and his books include themes of loss and suffering in the aftermath of a nuclear conflict. Prior to the full-scale invasion, Ukraine was home to hundreds of video game companies and an estimated tens of thousands of Ukrainian video game developers. Though the war has disrupted the young and booming industry, many companies have continued their operations, including the globally successful GSC Game World, whose S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is set to release Nov. 20. According to Metacritic.com, the game has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Metro Awakening is available on PlayStation VR2, Meta Quest 2 and 3, and Steam VR. VR games are not yet as popular as console and PC games due to their high cost and relatively low user base. An October 2024 survey from Steam, a popular video game platform, showed that about 2% of their users had VR headsets.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-metro-awakening-virtual-reality-video-game-expands-famous-game-franchise/	2024-11-07T10:17:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Metro-Awakening_Announcement_Screenshot_Art.png
NATO chief Rutte wants to discuss Russia-North Korea threat with Trump	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte wants to discuss with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump a joint response to the mounting threat from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, he said on Nov. 7. Pyongyang and Tehran have become Russia&apos;s key allies in its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing ammunition and missiles for Moscow&apos;s forces. China claimed neutrality in the war but backed Moscow in the face of Western sanctions, becoming its leading source of dual-use goods feeding the Russian defense industry. North Korea has also dispatched around 12,000 troops to join the war against Ukraine, which Rutte described as a risk not only to Europe but also to the U.S. &quot;Russia is delivering the latest technology into North Korea in return for North Korean help with the war against Ukraine,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to work together. So I look forward to sitting down with Donald Trump to discuss how we can face these threats collectively, what we need to do.&quot; Talking to reporters ahead of the meeting with European leaders in Budapest, Rutte backed Trump&apos;s earlier attempts to get NATO countries to spend more on defense, beyond the current 2% of GDP target. Trump has repeatedly lambasted European NATO members for not investing enough in their defense capabilities and instead relying on the U.S., saying that he would encourage Moscow to do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to the alliance members failing to meet the required spending. Speaking about support for Ukraine under Trump&apos;s presidency, Rutte said that Russia&apos;s victory in the war may put Europe, Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. at risk. Rutte said he believes that President Volodymyr Zelensky is capable of building relations with Trump. Zelensky congratulated Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election, voicing hopes for &quot;strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.&quot; The two also had a follow-up phone call, agreeing to strengthen cooperation, Ukraine&apos;s president said.	https://kyivindependent.com/rutte-wants-to-discuss-with-trump-russia-north-korea-threat/	2024-11-07T10:13:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-989900664.jpg
Google removed photos of Ukraine's military sites from its map, Ukrainian official says	The locations of military sites in Ukraine are no longer displayed on Google Maps, said Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Counter-Disinformation Center under Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, on Nov. 7. Kovalenko reported earlier on Nov. 3 that the tech giant&apos;s online map service had revealed the locations of Ukrainian defense infrastructure after a recent update. He said that images of Ukrainian military sites were visible on Google Maps and that Russian forces were &quot;actively dispersing&quot; the images. &quot;Google fixed the situation with maps... In the future, everything will be OK as well,&quot; Kovalenko said on Nov. 7. According to Google&apos;s press service, the satellite images were taken more than a year ago and come from publicly available sources. &quot;We deliberately do not publish the latest images of war zones,&quot; the company said in its statement published on Nov. 6. Kovalenko argued that old photos can reveal the strategy behind weapon locations, aiding Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/google-removed-photos-of-ukraines-military-sites-from-its-map-ukrainian-official-says/	2024-11-07T09:00:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2104088942.jpg
No Azeri gas deal currently on table to maintain flows via Ukraine, Naftogaz CEO says	No deal is currently on the table between Europe and Azerbaijan to keep gas flowing through Ukraine once a transit deal with Russia expires at the end of the year, despite reports a contract was nearing, CEO of Ukrainian state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz said. &#x201C;Over the next two months, before the deal is over, we might hear some manipulations and alternative ideas,&#x201D; Oleksiy Chernyshov told the Kyiv Independent on sidelines of the Kyiv International Economic Forum on Nov. 7. &quot;There is no alternative model at this moment on the table,&quot; adding that Ukraine &quot;is preparing for the full stop of gas transit by the end of the year&quot; once the deal expires. Ukraine has maintained that it will not renew any transit deal with Russia after the contract is up. As the contract&apos;s end approaches, Europe and Ukraine have been in talks with Azerbaijan to replace Russia as a supplier. Bloomberg reported on Oct. 1 that energy companies from Hungary and Slovakia were nearing a contract for up to 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas from Azerbaijan per year, citing people familiar with the negotiations. Later on Nov. 1, Slovakian state-owned gas importer SPP told Reuters that European firms were not close to an agreement with Azerbaijan to replace Russian gas flows through Ukraine, contradicting Bloomberg&apos;s report. Ukraine currently transits Russian gas to the European Union as part of a deal signed with Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom in 2019, which is set to expire in December 2024. While Moscow cut much of its pipeline gas transit to Europe in 2022, Slovakia, Austria, and Hungary remain heavily dependent on Russian imports.Gazprom supplied Slovakia with 89% of its gas consumed last year, Austria with 97% of its gas, and 47% of Hungary&apos;s, according to Sergiy Makogon, senior fellow of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and former CEO of Ukraine&#x2019;s Gas Transmission System Operator. Countries that rely on Russian gas will face a challenge once transit stops through Ukraine and are likely to be more vocal in the future, Chernyshov said. Russia-friendly Hungary already said last month that it wants to increase gas purchases from Gazprom next year.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sept. 6 that negotiations were underway with the EU, Moscow, and Kyiv to transport Azeri gas. Technically, it would be Russian gas just rebranded as Azeri gas, Makogon told the Kyiv Independent. While Azerbaijan supplied Europe with around 12 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas last year, Brussels and Baku&#x2019;s goal is to ramp this up to 20 bcm annually by 2030. But Baku has no excess gas available in the near term and has been importing gas from Russia and Turkmenistan, Makogon said in a report for CEPA. &#x201C;The idea to transit Azeri gas instead of Russian gas is still alive and promoted by some people close to the President&#x2019;s Office,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/naftogaz-ceo-no-deal-on-the-table-once-russian-gas-transit-end/	2024-11-07T08:35:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1820446236.jpg

Zelensky's office deputy head traveled to Russia at least 9 times after 2014, media investigation shows	Oleh Tatarov, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office, has traveled to Moscow at least nine times since Russia&apos;s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s investigation project Schemes reported on Nov. 7, citing obtained flight data. Tatarov is the most controversial official in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s administration. He was charged with bribery before joining the administration, but the corruption case against him has been obstructed by law enforcement agencies and courts and eventually closed. Prior to his appointment to the Presidential Office in 2020, Tatarov worked in the Internal Affairs Ministry under former pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych. Tatarov worked as a lawyer later in 2014. According to the investigation by Schemes, Tatarov visited Russia three times in 2017, four times in 2018, and twice in 2019. He traveled to Moscow from Kyiv via Belarus on most of his trips, since flights between Ukraine and Russia were suspended after 2014, Schemes reported. The last time Tatarov flew to Russia was the day after Zelensky won the presidential runoff on April 21, 2019, according to the media investigation. Tatarov also reportedly traveled to Russian-occupied Crimea in 2015. Ukraine&apos;s Crimean Peninsula was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. The reasons for Tatarov&apos;s trips are unknown. Neither Tatarov nor the Presidential Office commented on the reports.	https://kyivindependent.com/controversial-zelenskys-office-deputy-chief-reportedly-traveled-to-russia-at-least-9-times-after-2014/	2024-11-07T06:59:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1232943033.jpg
Ukraine expected to reopen one airport by end of January 2025	One of Ukraine&apos;s two airports, Lviv or Boryspil near Kyiv, will resume operations by the end of January 2025, Marsh McLennan Senior Partner Crispin Ellison said at the Kyiv International Economic Forum on Nov. 7. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine&apos;s airspace has been closed to all flights due to the risk of Russian attacks. The Ukrainian government has nonetheless looked for ways to restore the industry during the war. Under favorable circumstances, according to Ellison, five or six airlines could agree to operate flights from Ukraine in January. Securing insurance for aviation will be easier if planes use Lviv Airport, but President Volodymyr Zelensky insists that Boryspil International Airport be opened first, Ellison added. The passenger Airbus-320 and Boeing-737, as well as the small passenger airliner, will require insurance covering a sum of at least $750 million, according to Marsh McLennan Senior Partner. The Presidential Office will make the final decision on the flights, taking into account the security situation and the performance of Ukrainian air defense. The Communities and Territories Development Ministry presented in late October a roadmap for partially opening Ukraine&apos;s airspace. The ministry did not say which airports would open under the plan. On April 11, 2023, the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) published a seven-year forecast that included the likelihood of restrictions over Ukrainian airspace remaining in place until 2029. The State Enterprise for Air Traffic Services said in 2023 that Ukrainian airspace &quot;will reopen after the war ends.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-reopen-one-airport-by-end-of-january-2025/	2024-11-07T05:54:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/2021-12-100967116-3287225071296029-5433760260873519104-n-1.jpg
Russian airstrike against Zaporizhzhia injures 5, damages hospital	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russian forces attacked the city of Zaporizhzhia on Nov. 7, injuring five hospital employees, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. Russia struck Zaporizhzhia five times using guided aerial bombs. The attack hit several residential buildings and a hospital. The full consequences of the attack are being determined, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Zaporizhzhia, the regional center of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is a common target of Russian attacks. Some 710,000 residents lived in the city before the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022. A Russian strike against Zaporizhzhia on Nov. 5 killed six and injured 23 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaporizhzhia-hospital-strike/	2024-11-07T05:34:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-07-15_18_31.jpeg
Peace cannot be bought by weakness, Zelensky says at Budapest summit	Europe must show unity and adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach to face aggression from Russia and its allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 7 at the European Political Community Summit in Budapest. European leaders have gathered in Budapest amid growing uncertainty about what Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election will mean for allied support for Ukraine and European security. There are fears the new U.S. president might reduce support for Ukraine and seek a deal with the Kremlin at the cost of Ukraine&apos;s concessions. Reminding his recent phone call with Trump, Zelensky admitted uncertainty about the U.S.&apos;s future actions but voiced hope for a &quot;stronger America&quot; that Europe needs. &quot;There should be no illusions that a just peace can be bought by showing weakness,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Peace is a reward only for the strong.&quot; Ukrainian officials have sought to put a positive spin on Trump&apos;s victory, voicing hopes for a new vigor in Washington&apos;s decision-making and invoking memories of a former U.S. Republican president known for hawkish stance on Moscow, Ronald Reagan. &quot;Since the July summit of the European Political Community in Great Britain, there has been much talk about giving in to Putin, retreating, and making some &apos;concessions,&apos;&quot; the president noted. &quot;This is unacceptable for Ukraine and suicide for all of Europe.&quot; Zelensky asked rhetorically whether Europe should also seek favors with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who has provided ammunition and troops to Russia, in order to achieve peace. Kyiv has previously criticized the West for lack of response after revelations that Pyongyang has dispatched around 10,000-12,000 soldiers to join the war in an unprecedented escalation. &quot;No strong leader that has helped to build a united, strong, and peaceful Europe could imagine something like this.&quot; Zelensky again called on European partners to support Ukraine&apos;s 10-point peace formula for ending the war, underscoring nuclear, energy, and food security and the release of prisoners as key steps. &quot;Ukraine is grateful for all the support from our partners, and we are open to any constructive ideas to achieve just peace for our country,&quot; the president said. &quot;But it is Ukraine that must decide what should and should not be on the agenda.&quot; Ukraine finds itself in an increasingly precarious situation in the war as Russian forces keep advancing in Donetsk Oblast while the future of Western support under Trump&apos;s presidency looks increasingly uncertain. During the campaign, Trump claimed that if he returns to the White House, he will end Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine within &quot;24 hours.&quot; He hinted at his message again while delivering his victory speech, telling his cheering supporters, &quot;I&apos;m going to stop the wars.&quot; The Wall Street Journal reported that the plan might involve postponing Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO by at least 20 years, freezing the war along the current front lines, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east. Zelensky commented that Russia&apos;s aggression showed the weakness of the concept of neutrality, as Finland and Sweden&apos;s rapid accession to NATO demonstrated. &quot;The rapid accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO showed how European and Alliance leaders actually envision guaranteed security - not in words, but through NATO. Ukraine took note of this.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/peace-cannot-be-bought-by-weakness-zelensky-says-at-budapest-summit/	2024-11-07T05:23:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Zelenksy-in-Budapest.jpeg
Opinion: Trump’s election marks the death of Transatlanticism	Ahead of Election Day, there were signs of optimism for the United States&apos; allies in Europe. Polls had indicated a tight race since support for Kamala Harris leveled off in August, but expectations to outperform the polls and blind faith in humanity kept the Harris campaign and its millions of voters hopeful for victory. However, as the vote unfolded late Tuesday night and Europe awoke Wednesday morning, the transatlantic dream died once more &#x2014; this time, more decisively than ever. Joe Biden&apos;s election in 2020 was a relief for the U.S.&apos; closest allies in Europe. After four years of Donald Trump, Biden represented a course correction for American foreign policy. Shaped by the Cold War&apos;s geopolitical alliances and collective security blocs, he was a familiar figure to the European establishment, both in his worldview and from his time as vice president. Biden, in turn, understood the value of strong bilateral relations with European states and the importance of NATO in transatlantic security. Although sometimes flawed, particularly in his administration&apos;s unreasonable fear of escalation with Russia, his relationship with the continent formed the foundation for cooperative multilateral partnership. Though her priorities lay with domestic affairs, Kamala Harris would have continued to nurture strong relationships with American allies. Her support for Ukraine and appreciation of NATO and transatlantic security aligned her not only with her boss but also with the majority of European Union and NATO member states. Now, any hope of consistency and solidarity between the U.S. and its European allies is gone. Trump&apos;s second term promises to be even more volatile than his first, further radicalized by his 2020 election loss. As Europe braces for a difficult winter and a long 2025 in Ukraine, it must forge ahead without its most powerful transatlantic partner. Unlike the 2016 election, however, this result can&apos;t be dismissed as an anomaly. In two of the last three presidential elections, the U.S. electorate has voted for a man whose worldview is oriented solely around himself and whose foreign policy depends on who has most recently complimented him. The Biden administration&#x2019;s efforts to rebuild trust with allies and restore faith in a U.S.-led multilateral international community are now in vain as European hopes for another four years of reasoned, fact-based governance in the U.S. have failed to materialize. Europe will now have to set its own course, independent of the U.S., and without reliance on an ally whose foreign policy shifts drastically every four years. No country in Europe is more impacted by the election results than Ukraine. Though the Biden administration has frustrated Ukrainian leadership with its prohibition on striking military targets within Russia, it has been a resolute defender of Ukraine&apos;s right to self-determination and the importance of Ukrainian victory. Under Biden, the U.S. has been ready to support Ukraine for as long as Kyiv has the will, equipment, and manpower to fight. Trump, however, has long prioritized peace between Russia and Ukraine. His claim that he can bring peace to the conflict within a day of taking office does not bode well for Ukraine. Any peace deal negotiated between Ukraine and Russia under a Trump administration will be marred by Ukraine&apos;s weak position as it loses the leverage of continued support from the world&#x2019;s largest military force. The concession of internationally recognized Ukrainian territory would be inevitable. For Ukraine to survive, Europe must act decisively, with conviction and strong leadership. It will have to defy the new Trump administration&#x2019;s efforts to push Kyiv into an unfavorable peace deal and continue to support Ukraine with aid greater in volume and frequency than ever before. Ukraine cannot afford a continent of Olaf Scholzes, willing to make the same mistake Neville Chamberlain made in Munich 86 years ago in the name of peace. As long as Ukrainians are willing to fight, Europe must stand with them, regardless of support from across the Atlantic. Transatlanticism is no longer the invariable foundation of American foreign policy &#x2014; nor can it be for Europe.

West must negotiate war's end based on 'current realities,' Shoigu says	The West should recognize that Russia is currently winning the war against Ukraine and therefore start negotiations, Sergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia&apos;s Security Council, said on Nov. 7, the Russian state news agency TASS reported. Shoigu&apos;s statement comes shortly after Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. Trump&apos;s victory also comes at an especially precarious moment in the war, when Russian troops advance swiftly in Donetsk Oblast. The president-elect has previously criticized military aid to Ukraine and voiced his intention to &quot;get out&quot; of the war. Former Defense Minister Shoigu accused the West of trying to use Ukraine to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, adding that the plan had failed. &quot;The West is facing a choice &#x2014; to continue funding it (the war) and destroying the Ukrainian population or to recognize the current realities and start negotiations,&quot; Shoigu said. Trump has criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky while on the campaign trail. He previously laid the blame for Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine on Zelensky and U.S. President Joe Biden without mentioning Russian President Vladimir Putin and has referred to Zelensky as a &quot;salesman&quot; for securing what Trump deemed too much military aid. During the campaign, Trump claimed that if he returns to the White House, he will end Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine within &quot;24 hours.&quot; He hinted at his message again while delivering his victory speech, telling his cheering supporters, &quot;I&apos;m going to stop the wars.&quot; The Wall Street Journal reported that the plan might involve postponing Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO by at least 20 years, freezing the war along the current front lines, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east.	https://kyivindependent.com/west-must-negotiate-to-end-war-in-ukraine-given-current-realities-shoigu-says/	2024-11-07T04:36:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2151581541.jpg
5 Ukraine stories you might've missed because of US election	As the world waited with bated breath for the result of the U.S. elections, Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine did not relent. Donald Trump&apos;s sweeping victory no doubt spells an uncertain future for the besieged country. But Russia&apos;s grinding advances in Donbas, drone attacks, and yet more allegations of war crimes committed by Moscow&apos;s forces all continued no matter who was delivering a victory speech across the Atlantic. We bring you five stories about Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine that you might&apos;ve missed in the wake of the U.S. presidential election. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence was behind a drone attack against the city of Kaspiysk in Russia&apos;s Dagestan Republic, targeting a Russian naval base, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 6. At least two vessels &#x2013; Gepard-class missile ships Tatarstan and Dagestan &#x2013; were damaged in the attack, and possibly also several small Project 21631 Buyan-M corvettes, sources said. Dagestan authorities reported intercepting a drone attack over Kaspiysk, a port city at the Caspian Sea around 1,000 kilometers from the front line (600 miles), on the morning of Nov. 6. &quot;Russian Navy ships are stationed in Kaspiysk,&quot; said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. The base is home to Russia&apos;s Caspian Flotilla, as well as Russian Marines and Coastal Troops. Based on satellite imagery, at least eight vessels were present at the naval base after the attack, open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysts said. Some reports suggested that Ukraine may have targeted the supply routes of Iranian weapons flowing to Russia via the Caspian Sea. The strike took place roughly 15 kilometers from a local airport, the Mash news channel claimed, identifying the drone as a Ukrainian A-22 Flying Fox drone. The nearby Makhachkala airport has suspended operations for an indefinite period due to the incident, local authorities said. Kyiv knows of 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) who were executed by Russian forces on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 6. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Speaking on national television, Denys Lysenko, the head of the department focused on war-related crimes, said that 49 criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of Ukrainian POWs. The most recent cases include the killing of six captured Ukrainian soldiers near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, prosecutors reported on Nov. 5. &quot;We are now analyzing all these cases, looking for patterns... We are considering all these cases comprehensively, and the involvement of a particular armed unit is, of course, analyzed in each case,&quot; Lysenko said. Former Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin called the killing of Ukrainian soldiers in captivity a &quot;deliberate policy&quot; of Russia. Some 80% of the cases of executions of Ukrainian POWs were recorded in 2024, but the trend began to appear in November 2023, when &quot;there were changes in the attitude of Russian military personnel towards our prisoners of war for the worse,&quot; said Yurii Belousov, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office. Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Nov. 7, striking a residential building in the capital and injuring at least one person, the Kyiv City Military Administration reported. According to Kyiv&apos;s military administration, the drone strike caused &quot;significant damage&quot; to a unit in the apartment building in the Holosiivskyi district of the city. The administration also reported a large fire nearby caused by falling drone debris at a car repair shop. Multiple explosions were heard in the outskirts of Kyiv around 1 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground.

(State Emergency Service/Telegram)The aftermath of a Russian drone strike against Kyiv on Nov. 7, 2024. (State Emergency Service/Telegram)Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned throughout the night that Russian attack drones were in the vicinity of the city. Around 6 a.m. local time, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted on Telegram that wreckage also fell in the Pechersk district and caused a fire on the 33rd floor of a residential building. The fire was contained shortly after. Wreckage from the ongoing attack has also fallen in the Podil district, where a two-story house caught fire, in the Obolon district, where a business center caught fire on the upper floors, and in the Solomianskyi district, where debris fell both in a yard of a house and onto a private medical facility. Germany&apos;s three-party governing coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that he had dismissed Finance Minister Christian Lindner, an event that could have a profound effect on the country&apos;s support for Ukraine. The decision to fire Lindner over economic disagreements will likely propel the country into a snap election in the near term, as it is unlikely that Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SDP) will have enough votes to pass the 2025 budget. Under the current ruling coalition, Berlin allocated 7.6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in military assistance for Kyiv in the 2024 budget. The next year&apos;s budget allocated roughly half of that sum. In his statement following the dismissal, Scholz partly justified the decision by noting that he had asked Lindner to relax spending rules to allow increased aid for Ukraine, but Lindner refused. &quot;All too often, Minister Lindner has blocked laws in an inappropriate manner,&quot; Scholz said. &quot;Too often he has engaged in petty party-political tactics. Too often he has broken my trust.&quot; German media reported last week that Lindner&apos;s proposed policy paper called for significant changes to the country&apos;s economic policy, including reducing regulations on climate policy to stimulate economic growth as well as proposing tax cuts &#x2014; in deep contrast with Scholz. Political instability in Berlin may spell trouble for Kyiv amid the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party &#x2014; known for its amicable views toward the Kremlin &#x2014; which has continuously called for cutting funding for Ukraine. A snap election might not necessarily mean disaster for Ukraine, however. Current polls show that while second, the AfD lags behind the center-right Conservative Christian Union-Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), whose leader, Friedrich Merz, has called for more decisive steps in support of Ukraine, including the delivery of Taurus missiles. Scholz said he would ask Merz for parliamentary support to pass the budget. South Korea does not rule out providing arms to Ukraine in the light of deepening cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a press conference on Nov. 7. &quot;Now, depending on the level of North Korean involvement, we will gradually adjust our support strategy in phases,&quot; Yoon told the media. &quot;This means we are not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons.&quot; Russian-North Korean ties entered a new level when Pyongyang dispatched around 12,000 troops to join Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Yoon said previously that Seoul might revise its ban on supplying direct military assistance to a warzone in response. South Korea has provided Ukraine with humanitarian and non-lethal aid but refused to provide weapons, citing legislative restrictions. Some media reports from last year claimed that the country secretly supplied artillery shells to Ukraine via the U.S., though the South Korean government denied the reports. Living in constant tension with its North Korean neighbors, South Korea boasts a powerful military and strong defense industry, making the country a major arms exporter. It remains unclear what weapons systems South Korea is considering, though Yoon commented that &quot;defensive weapons&quot; would be a priority. A source in South Korea&apos;s Presidential Office told the Yonhap news agency that a direct supply of 155 mm artillery shells is currently not on the table. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition supplies. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. Ukrainian officials said that simply holding the front against Russian forces requires 75,000 shells a month. Moscow&apos;s troops can fire several times more shells than Ukraine, with roughly half reportedly provided by North Korea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-news-you-missed-during-us-election/	2024-11-07T04:22:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-07_11-40-49-1.jpg
UK targets Russian-backed mercenaries, defense industry in major sanctions package	The U.K. government on Nov. 7 announced its largest package of sanctions against Russia since May 2023, focusing on the Russian defense industry and mercenary groups. The new 56 listings include the Moscow-backed mercenary group Africa Corps, private companies linked to the Wagner Group, and suppliers feeding Russia&apos;s war through arms and dual-use goods. Russia has long been using private military groups, most notoriously Wagner, to back friendly regimes in Africa and loot natural resources. Their activities have been accompanied by widespread human rights violations. The Russian Defense Ministry launched the Africa Corps in 2024 to replace Wagner after the group&apos;s brief rebellion in June 2023 and the death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in a plane crash in August of that year. The U.K. is now the first G7 country to sanction Africa Corps, a group bearing the same name as Nazi forces in Africa in World War II. Africa Corps, two other private mercenary groups, and 11 Kremlin-linked individuals have been sanctioned over human rights abuses and threatening peace and security in Libya, Mali, and the Central African Republic, the U.K. Foreign Office said in a statement. &quot;Today&apos;s measures will continue to push back on the Kremlin&apos;s corrosive foreign policy, undermining Russia&apos;s attempts to foster instability across Africa and disrupting the supply of vital equipment for Putin&#x2019;s war machine,&quot; U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. &quot;And smashing the illicit international networks that Russia has worked so hard to forge.&quot; The list further includes 28 entities based in China, Central Asia, and Turkey that provide &quot;machine tools, microelectronics, components for drones, ball bearings or other goods to the Russian military-industrial complex.&quot; The U.K. sanctioned Russian military intelligence (GRU) Denis Sergeev, also going by the name &quot;Sergej Fedotov,&quot; who was linked by British authorities to the Novichok poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in 2018 in Salisbury, U.K.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-targets-russian-mercenaries-in-major-sanctions-package/	2024-11-07T04:14:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/wagner.jpeg
Zelensky arrives in Hungary for European Political Community Summit	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Budapest on Nov. 7 to take part in the European Political Community Summit. The fifth meeting of the European Political Community will focus on Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing escalation in the Middle East, among other topics. &quot;We will discuss security challenges in Europe, as well as new opportunities for all partners,&quot; Zelensky said ahead of the meeting. European Council President Charles Michel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose country currently chairs the Council of the EU, invited European leaders to the summit in late October.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-hungary/	2024-11-07T03:26:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182686110.jpg
Opinion: 3 ways Trump’s return to power could unfold for Ukraine	Donald Trump should be pleased. Not only is he on his way back to the White House, but he could return as one of the most powerful U.S. presidents in decades: The Supreme Court aligns with his vision, the Republican Party has been reshaped around loyalty, and both the Senate and (probably) the House are red. He even won the once-elusive popular vote. Moreover, since he&#x2019;s constitutionally barred from running again, there&#x2019;s little stopping Trump from implementing his wildest visions. There is value in having a &#x201C;strong vertical&#x201D; &#x2014; the ability to make quick decisions and turn them into actions. Consider how U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration struggled to push the Ukraine aid bill through a Republican-controlled House. This challenge would have likely been worse under Kamala Harris, who would have faced Ukraine support being politicized against her &#x2014; held hostage by an adversarial Senate and/or House to extract politically painful concessions. Unfortunately for Ukraine, that&#x2019;s where the good news likely ends. Trump and his proxies have shown a mix of skepticism and hostility toward continued aid to Ukraine. Figures like Elon Musk, who once helped Ukraine with Starlink, have shifted to anti-Ukraine rhetoric on social media. U.S. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance has publicly argued that Taiwan matters more to the U.S. than Ukraine. Fortunately, Trump&#x2019;s public statements are unreliable indicators of his policy plans. Information about his private conversations and views, including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, provides a bit more insight &#x2014; but not by much. In short, Trump wants Russia to stay neutral in a potential U.S.-China conflict, and to secure that he may push for territorial and political concessions from Ukraine. Ideally, he would like Ukraine to neither win nor lose. On a positive note, some reports even hint at consistent, or even increased, military support for Ukraine, if only to ramp up U.S. defense industry capacity for the Pacific. The problem is that Russia currently has the upper hand and would likely reject any deal that leaves a viable Ukraine. The U.S. has few tools to effectively pressure Russia, and China would probably increase support for Moscow to keep it in its orbit. Nor does this look promising for Kyiv. A bad peace deal could trigger elections and internal chaos as blame shifts to the surface. It could also open borders, prompting mass male emigration. With a weakened Ukraine and a West distracted by emerging crises, Russia would likely seize the opportunity to attack again. Fortunately for Ukraine, it may not be an immediate priority for Trump. Upon entering office, his focus will be split across numerous domestic issues, starting with his own legal battles. Trump faces four high-stakes cases &#x2014; likely to be delayed or dismissed, but still requiring time and attention. Then there&#x2019;s the U.S. debt ceiling. U.S. debt service costs reached a record $1.2 trillion in the fiscal year ending in October 2024 &#x2014; more than military spending. The current debt ceiling suspension expires on Jan. 2, 2025, just before a new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3 and Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. This issue is more than the headache of starting the presidency with a government shut down. Trump&#x2019;s proposed tax cuts and spending promises will increase national debt, a concern for his Silicon Valley supporters, while further fueling inflation. Rising living costs drove many of his supporters to vote for him, creating tough trade-offs &#x2014; especially with tariffs, which are inherently inflationary. Ironically, Trump could try to control energy prices, either by releasing reserves or pressing Saudi Arabia to do so &#x2014; which might impact Russia more than any direct support for Ukraine. Finally, there are domestic issues including abortion restrictions, reshaping political institutions (the infamous &#x201C;Project 2025&#x201D;), and immigration. Talk of mass deportations may follow a similar path as the &#x201C;Trump Wall&#x201D; after 2016 &#x2014; taking years to implement and ultimately proving largely symbolic. Though he may appear all-powerful on paper, the radical wing of his party, including the so-called Freedom Caucus, holds blocking power, which he will need to manage. In brief, Trump will likely delegate Ukraine to an envoy &#x2014; either due to domestic demands or a realization that there&#x2019;s no easy win. Possible figures for this role include ex-acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell (also Trump&#x2019;s envoy to Serbia-Kosovo in 2019-2021), ex-National Security Advisor Robert O&#x2019;Brien, or ex-CIA head and ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiation position is weak and worsening, which would impact the terms of any potential deal. Indeed, the current Russian offensive &#x2014; which recently saw the largest weekly territorial gain this year &#x2014; appears timed to strengthen Moscow&#x2019;s position before Trump&#x2019;s inauguration. Kyiv&#x2019;s likely strategy will be to engage with Trump&#x2019;s envoy and try to show Ukraine as a promising business opportunity, that supporting it demonstrates strength, and that they can deliver a win under the right conditions (as Zelensky&#x2019;s recent statement about &#x201C;peace through strength&#x201D; suggests). Engaging parts of Trump&#x2019;s base, including evangelicals and isolationists, will also be crucial. Russia, with a better ground game in Washington, will lobby both and leverage or even create crises involving the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. Realistically, Kyiv senses this may mean &#x201C;delivering deals&#x201D; for Trump&#x2019;s inner circle. It&#x2019;s no coincidence that Zelensky and others emphasize Ukraine&#x2019;s potential in lithium, titanium, gold, uranium, and gas production. Ukraine will likely try to maintain control over the peace process by pushing for a second peace summit, potentially set around the three-year anniversary of the full-scale invasion. Whether this works is uncertain. The most probable scenario is a partial U.S. disengagement, leaving Europe to fill the gap. This could unfold in three broad directions: Stagnation in U.S. support, Europe steps up: Trump might attempt a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, but Russia could reject any terms allowing a viable Ukraine, demanding more territory or internal changes. Recognizing there&#x2019;s no clear win, Trump may disengage, maintaining only minimal support. Europe would likely need to increase support, potentially deploying boots on the ground for training or later, for combat. While politically challenging, some Nordic countries might lead the way, potentially joined by Poland and Czechia. This support could keep Ukraine fighting until late 2025, by which point Russia&#x2019;s resources may deplete, forcing it to accept terms that leave Ukraine viable. A forced ceasefire in early 2025: Trump could bring Russia to the table and propose terms that Ukraine might accept, such as freezing the conflict at the current front lines and offering security guarantees short of NATO, potentially incorporating elements similar to South Korea&apos;s security arrangement. A ceasefire would prompt Ukrainian elections and, depending on the terms and promised reconstruction funds, either stability or chaos. There would also probably be a mass exodus of men. The main challenge of this scenario is that terms that leave Ukraine viable and able to rebuild are unacceptable to Russia. Moscow would only accept these terms if it sees them leading to Western disengagement and internal Ukrainian chaos &#x2014; creating an opening to attack again after Ukraine demobilizes and internal divisions deepen. Ukrainian collapse: If Trump disengages entirely and Europe can&#x2019;t compensate for the loss, Ukraine faces economic and military collapse. Manpower shortages, ongoing attrition, and limited financial resources could create a vicious cycle. This scenario, while distant, is possible. The unpredictability of Trump&#x2019;s presidency leaves open the chance of significantly more support for Ukraine. But the harsh truth is that this is unlikely, and both Ukraine and Europe need strong contingency plans.

Kyiv-born former US soldier, Trump whistleblower, elected to US Congress	Eugene Vindman, a retired U.S. soldier who gained prominence for his role as a whistleblower against then-President Donald Trump along with his twin brother Alexander, won the election to the House of Representatives in Virginia, the Associated Press reported on Nov. 6. The Ukraine-born politician was elected on the same day Donald Trump won the presidential race and secured his return to the White House in January 2025. Vindman was born in Kyiv in 1975 as Yevhen Vindman, but moved to the U.S. as a child and goes by Eugene. The two brothers helped reveal the phone call that Trump held with President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019, in which Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine into launching an investigation into the family of Joe Biden, who was widely expected at the time to be the Democratic frontrunner and his likely opponent. The call was the key component of Trump&apos;s first impeachment. Both brothers were serving as aides to the National Security Council at the time, and Eugene was dismissed in 2020 in what he called a politically-motivated firing. Vindman beat Republican and former Special Forces officer Derrick Anderson by a narrow margin. Vindman replaced Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who decided to run for governor in 2025 instead. Vindman focused his campaign on abortion rights and the threat of Trump&apos;s MAGA movement to democracy. &quot;With the support of our grassroots army, we accomplished something together that many didn&apos;t think was possible,&quot; Vindman said. &quot;It&apos;s a testament to the power of the American experience that an immigrant who escaped a Soviet Regime and came to this great nation with less than $800 in our pockets would now stand here as a congressman-elect of the United States House of Representatives.&quot; While it remains unclear whether the Democratic Party will be able to wrestle control of the House from the Republicans, the Republican Party has already won back the Senate. Vindman became the second Ukrainian native to serve in the U.S. Congress. Victoria Spartz, who was born in Chernihiv Oblast and moved to the U.S. in 2000, was re-elected to Congress representing Indiana&apos;s 5th congressional district. Spartz initially supported aid for Ukraine and spoken about the war in deeply personal terms, but also attracted controversy for her attacks against President Volodymyr Zelensky and head of the Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak. Despite being born in Ukraine, she did not vote for the Senate foreign aid bill in April 2024, which contained more than $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-born-former-us-soldier-known-as-trump-whistleblower-elected-to-us-congress/	2024-11-07T03:06:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2157665669.jpg
South Korea 'not ruling out' supplying arms to Ukraine, president says	South Korea does not rule out providing arms to Ukraine in the light of deepening cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a press conference on Nov. 7. &quot;Now, depending on the level of North Korean involvement, we will gradually adjust our support strategy in phases,&quot; Yoon told the media. &quot;This means we are not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons.&quot; Russian-North Korean ties entered a new level when Pyongyang dispatched around 12,000 troops to join Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Yoon said previously that Seoul might revise its ban on supplying direct military assistance to a warzone in response. South Korea has provided Ukraine with humanitarian and non-lethal aid but refused to provide weapons, citing legislative restrictions. Some media reports from last year claimed that the country secretly supplied artillery shells to Ukraine via the U.S., though the South Korean government denied the reports. Living in constant tension with its North Korean neighbors, South Korea boasts a powerful military and strong defense industry, making the country a major arms exporter. It remains unclear what weapons systems South Korea is considering, though Yoon commented that &quot;defensive weapons&quot; would be a priority. A source in South Korea&apos;s Presidential Office told the Yonhap news agency that a direct supply of 155 mm artillery shells is currently not on the table. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition supplies. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. Ukrainian officials said that simply holding the front against Russian forces requires 75,000 shells a month. Moscow&apos;s troops can fire several times more shells than Ukraine, with roughly half reportedly provided by North Korea.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-not-ruling-out-supplying-arms-to-ukraine/	2024-11-07T02:46:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161646683.jpg
Ukraine may have targeted Iranian weapon supply routes in Dagestan strike, media suggests	Ukrainian forces may have targeted routes in Dagestan used by Iran to supply weapons to Russia, the War Zone media outlet said on Nov. 6. Dagestan authorities reported intercepting a drone attack over Kaspiysk, a port city at the Caspian Sea around 1,000 kilometers from the front line (600 miles), on the morning of Nov. 6. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence was behind the attack, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. In the first Ukrainian attack against a naval base in Dagestan, at least two vessels &#x2014; missile ships Tatarstan and Dagestan &#x2014; were damaged in the attack, and possibly also several small Project 21631 ships, according to the source. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Although the precise consequences of the Ukrainian attack are difficult to establish, the recent strike is still &quot;significant in several ways,&quot; the War Zone&apos;s experts said. The port in Dagestan is not only a base for the Russian Caspian Flotilla and several military units of the Russian Armed Forces but is also located along the routes used by Iran to deliver weapons to Russia. Until the recent Ukrainian attack, this route was considered safe for transportation due to being supposedly out of the range of Ukrainian weapons. While Russian authorities claimed to have intercepted a single drone in the skies, a video shared on social media appears to show another drone hitting its target, resulting in a large explosion. The incident took place roughly 15 kilometers (10 miles) from a local airport, the Mash news channel claimed, identifying the drone as a Ukrainian A-22 Flying Fox drone. The nearby Makhachkala airport has suspended operations for an indefinite period due to the incident, local authorities said.	https://kyivindependent.com/dagestan-supply-routes/	2024-11-07T01:52:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1996162455.jpg
Ukrainian PM hopes for 'clear and quick' steps by Trump on Ukraine	Ukraine is cautiously optimistic about continued U.S. support under President-elect Donald Trump and expects &quot;clear and quick steps&quot; from the new leadership, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at an event attended by the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 7. &quot;Donald Trump is a strong leader, there is no doubt about that,&quot; Shmyhal said at the Kyiv International Economic Forum. Former President Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, handily defeating Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump now becomes president-elect and will be inaugurated into office on Jan. 20, 2025. The victory of the Republican nominee spells an uncertain future for Ukraine as Trump has criticized military aid for Kyiv and said he intends to &quot;get out&quot; of the war. Shmyhal believes that there is continued bipartisan support for Ukraine both in the U.S. Congress and within the American society, providing grounds for &quot;careful optimism.&quot; The Republican Party has won not only the White House but also the Senate, while the House elections still hang in the balance. The prime minister highlighted President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s phone call with Trump after the election, which Ukraine&apos;s head of state described as an &quot;excellent phone conversation.&quot; Ukrainian officials sought to put a positive spin on Trump&apos;s victory, expecting a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach and invoking memories of a former U.S. Republican president known for hawkish stance on Moscow, Ronald Reagan. &quot;We understand that the U.S.&apos;s core value is the protection of democracy, the protection of democratic values. This remains unchanged, regardless of the elections,&quot; Shmyhal commented. &quot;I am sure that we can continue our cooperation with the United States.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/shmyhal-trump/	2024-11-07T01:02:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960387.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 13 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two and injured 13 people over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 7. In Kherson Oblast, 21 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, were attacked by Russia. One person was killed, while other eight suffered injuries, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Sumy Oblast, one person was killed, and another one was injured in a strike against the Yampil community. Russian forces carried out the attack with four guided aerial bombs, local military administration reported. Russia launched a mass drone attack on Kyiv, injuring two people. The air raid alert in Ukraine&apos;s capital lasted eight hours, while the air defenses shot down over 30 UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), according to Serhii Popko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. As a result of the attack by Russian drones, debris fell in six districts of the city, damaging residential and non-residential buildings. Odesa was also attacked by drones overnight on Nov. 7, Governor Oleh Kiper said. The strike injured a 30-year-old man, who was provided with medical help at the scene. The falling drone debris damaged an 11-story residential building, two five-story buildings, 14 cars, and a gas pipeline. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured in the village of Sukhi Yaly, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-2-injure-13-over-past-day/	2024-11-07T00:04:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-07-09_42_43.jpeg
Putin, Russian officials privately congratulate Trump, media reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump &quot;through acquaintances&quot; instead of an official phone call, the Russian independent news outlet Verstka reported on Nov. 6. Previously, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he is not aware of any plans by Putin to congratulate Trump, as the U.S. is an unfriendly country &quot;involved in a war against Russia.&quot; Trump received informal and indirect congratulations also from other top Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, Chairman of the Board of Sberbank German Gref, and speakers of the two houses of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko and Vyacheslav Volodin, Verstka reported, citing a Russian parliamentary source. Trump claimed victory in a presidential vote on Nov. 5, defeating his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris. The election is expected to have a profound impact on Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, as some worry Trump might seek to cut a deal with Putin at the cost of painful concessions by Kyiv. The U.S. president-elect has also often boasted about close relations with Putin and mocked Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky as the &quot;greatest salesman on earth&quot; for receiving U.S. military assistance. Putin claimed indifference to the result of the vote and once even said he would prefer Harris as a president in an apparent wry remark, while U.S. intelligence has accused Russia of election interference to boost Trump. Russian officials offered mixed responses to Trump&apos;s election. While some were cautiously optimistic about a possible decrease in support for Ukraine, others believed that Washington&apos;s foreign policy would not change fundamentally. &quot;Hopes are primarily associated with the reduction of aid to Ukraine during (the war),&quot; Verstka&apos;s source said, believing Trump is a much better option for Russia than Harris.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-informally-congratulates-trump-media-reports/	2024-11-06T23:46:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Trump's team mulls postponing Ukraine's NATO membership for at least 20 years, WSJ reports	One idea within U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team for ending Russia&apos;s war involves delaying Kyiv&apos;s NATO membership for at least 20 years in exchange for continued arms supplies, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Nov. 6, citing three sources close to Trump. Trump, who won the presidential vote on Nov. 5, has repeatedly said that he would end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Ukraine. Earlier media reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicated this would entail freezing the war on the current front lines and creating a demilitarized zone in the east, a claim also supported by the WSJ&apos;s sources. Russia currently occupies roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory in the south and the east and continues steadily pushing back Ukrainian defenders, albeit at the cost of heavy losses. It remains unclear who would police the 800-mile (1,300 kilometers) long demilitarized zone, but an undisclosed Trump&apos;s aide told the WSJ that Washington would demand European allies to send in their troops. This proposal is only one of the ideas circling around in Trump&apos;s team, and the president-elect has a tendency to make major policy decisions on the spot, the sources said. Two of Trump&apos;s advisors, retired General Keith Kellogg and Fred Fleitz, proposed in June to cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia. At the same time, Kellogg said the plan would entail additional warnings to Russia that the U.S. would increase its military support to Ukraine if it refused the terms of the ceasefire. Fleitz said Trump reacted positively to the plan but added, &quot;I&apos;m not claiming he agreed with it or agreed with every word of it.&quot; The plan also involved taking Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession off the table for &quot;an extended period in exchange for a comprehensive and verifiable peace deal with security guarantees.&quot; Ukraine submitted a request for NATO membership in 2022 but has not received an invitation, receiving a cold response from U.S. President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and others. Both Kyiv and Moscow said it would not be possible to end the war within 24 hours, as Trump claims. Ukraine has been adamant about not recognizing Russian occupation of its territories but has acknowledged some may have to be liberated by diplomatic means. In turn, Russia currently holds the upper hand on the battlefield, outnumbering and outgunning Ukrainian troops, likely having little incentive to seek a settlement.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-ukraine-plan-wsj/	2024-11-06T23:25:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181151857.jpg
Russia summons Moldova's ambassador over 'hostile' attitude to Russian election observers	The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned Moldovan Ambassador Lilian Darius on Nov. 6 to protest Chisinau&apos;s allegedly &quot;hostile and discriminatory&quot; actions against Russian election observers, an accusation Moldova rejected. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu won on Nov. 3 by a margin of about 55.3% to 44.7%, despite what she called an &quot;unprecedented&quot; election interference backed by Moscow. The Russian-friendly Party of Socialists, who supported Sandu&apos;s opponent, Alexandr Stoianoglo, also announced on Nov. 5 that they do not view Sandu as legitimately elected and will not recognize her as president. Two days after the runoff, Stoinoglo conceded, saying &#xA0;that the presidential election results &quot;showed that we lost, although here in Moldova, we won.&quot; The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that prior to the first round of voting and the constitutional referendum on European Union accession, which took place on Oct. 20, the Moldovan authorities &quot;unreasonably&quot; denied accreditation to five international observers from Russia. The ministry claimed that before the second round of the presidential election on Nov. 3, three Russian members of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) mission were denied entry to Moldova at Chisinau airport despite being accredited by the Moldovan Central Election Commission. The ministry did not disclose who the international observers from Russia were. Moldova&apos;s Foreign Ministry rejected the Russian accusations, emphasizing that the presidential election met &quot;all national and international standards,&quot; according to the preliminary reports of international election observation missions. &quot;&#x2026;we refute the unfounded criticisms launched by representatives of the Russian authorities with the aim of manipulating public opinion,&quot; the statement read. &quot;These clumsy attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the elections are nothing but a continuation of malign interference in our internal affairs.&quot; Moldovan authorities, independent observers, and officials from the EU and the U.S. pointed to a malign influence campaign involving criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Moldovan lawmakers claimed that Moscow spent millions of dollars backing Stoianoglo. Sandu has long insisted that the real opponent to her government and Moldova&apos;s European path is the Kremlin, which has been waging a hybrid war designed to push Chisinau back into Moscow&apos;s orbit in what Sandu described &quot;a fraud of unprecedented proportions.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-summons-moldovas-ambassador-over-hostile-attitude-to-russian-election-observers/	2024-11-06T23:17:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178740463.jpg
Trump, South Korean president discuss North Korean troops joining Russia's war	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a phone call on Nov. 7 after the former won the U.S. presidential election, discussing future cooperation. The topics of their discussion included North Korea, namely its developing nuclear capabilities, missile tests, and a dispatch of troops to assist Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. Pyongyang reportedly dispatched around 12,000 soldiers to support Moscow&apos;s forces in embattled Kursk Oblast in an unprecedented escalation of the war against Ukraine. Details of the conversation were not disclosed. Trump&apos;s return to the White House in January spells uncertainty for the future U.S. support for Ukraine as the president-elect has signaled intent to cut down aid and seek a deal with Moscow. Trump has also often boasted about warm relations with authoritarian leaders and dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In the 12-minute conversation, Trump and Yoon further discussed a trilateral relationship between the U.S., South Korea, and Japan, shipbuilding industry cooperation, and agreed to meet in person in near future.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-yoon-discuss-north-korean-troops/	2024-11-06T22:22:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1623643744.jpg

This number includes 1,400 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,224 tanks, 18,612 armored fighting vehicles, 28,411 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,194 artillery systems, 1,245 multiple launch rocket systems, 996 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,408 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-704-300-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-06T22:10:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173731490.jpg
Belarus cracks down ahead of January election, over 100 people detained	Belarusian authorities have initiated a wave of arrests ahead of January&#x2019;s election, Viasna human rights center reported on Nov. 6. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, is seeking a seventh term. According to Viasna, over 100 people have been detained in the last week. Many of those arrested have been linked to online neighborhood chats, which authorities recently labeled &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; and accuse of being part of a conspiracy. These local chats, once used to coordinate 2020 protests against alleged election fraud, are now seen as threats. Jails are overcrowded, and many detainees, including political prisoners, face harsh conditions. Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya condemned the crackdown, calling on the West to respond and urging Belarusians to vote against all candidates. Belarus hasn&#x2019;t had free or fair elections since 1994. The previous presidential election, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide with 80% of the vote, provoked nationwide protests and a subsequent regime crackdown on dissent. In the course of quelling the opposition, Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime eliminated independent media, closed over 1,700 non-profit civic organizations, banned all but four political parties loyal to the regime, and jailed over 1,300 political prisoners.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-cracks-down-ahead-of-january-election-over-100-people-detained/	2024-11-06T19:42:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1228487473.jpg
Warsaw to host international conference on rebuilding Ukraine's energy infrastructure	The ReBuild Ukraine 4.0 conference will take place on Nov. 13-14 in Warsaw, Poland, the Odesa Journal reported on Nov. 6. The conference, organized by Ukraine&#x2019;s Ministry of Energy, will bring together Ukrainian and international leaders to discuss rebuilding Ukraine&#x2019;s war-damaged energy infrastructure. With support from the Ministries of Restoration and Economy and the American Chamber of Commerce, the conference aims to attract substantial international investment to aid recovery efforts and support displaced communities. The event will cover six major topics, including policy priorities, investment opportunities, electricity grid innovations, renewable energy, AI applications in energy, and workforce development. Key international organizations and government representatives from Canada, Germany, France, and others have confirmed their attendance. The conference seeks to foster cooperation among public and private sectors to modernize Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector for resilience and sustainability. Additionally, ReBuild Ukraine 4.0 will advocate for reducing dependency on Russian fossil fuels by promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, aiming to enhance both Ukraine&apos;s and Europe&#x2019;s energy security. Ukraine has lost 9 gigawatts of power generation, including eight thermal plants and five hydro plants, due to Russian strikes this year. Without stable power, Ukrainians will face another round of blackouts similar to the ones in the summer which could last as long as eight hours a day, according to Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group. Brutally cold winter temperatures during power outages will freeze pipes, cutting off Ukrainians&#x2019; access to water and heating, and may lead to another wave of refugees, the UN&#x2019;s refugee agency (UNHCR) told the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/warsaw-to-host-international-conference-on-rebuilding-ukraines-energy-infrastructure/	2024-11-06T18:19:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1244621149-1.jpg
Russian drone attack on Kyiv damages residential building, auto repair shop	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Nov. 6, striking a residential building in the capital, the Kyiv City Military Administration reported. According to the military administration, the drone strike caused &quot;significant damage&quot; to a unit in the apartment building in the Holosiyvski district of the city. Preliminary reports indicate that there was no fire and no casualties in the attack. The military administration also reported a large fire nearby caused by falling drone debris at an auto repair shop. Emergency responders are currently on route to extinguish the blaze. Multiple explosions were heard in the outskirts of Kyiv around 1 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force warned throughout the night that Russian attack drones were in the vicinity of the city. The most recent attack is the latest in a series of drone strikes targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine&#x2019;s capital. On Nov. 2, a Russian drone attack on Kyiv caused a fire in a 16-story residential building and an office building, and left an 82-year-old woman with shrapnel injuries to the head. Russia also attacked Kyiv with drones on Oct. 29, injuring six people in Kyiv&apos;s Solomianskyi district, authorities reported. Russia launched over 2,000 attack drones targeting both civilian and military sites across Ukraine last month, Kyiv&#x2019;s military reported on Nov. 1, as Kremlin forces continue their offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-on-kyiv-damages-residential-building/	2024-11-06T16:39:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1592375370.jpg
Biden administration rushing to deliver $6 billion in remaining aid to Ukraine ahead of Trump's inauguration, Politico reports	The Biden administration is planning to rush the delivery of the remaining $6 billion in military aid to Ukraine ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in January 2025, Politico reported on Nov. 6. Two administration officials told Politico that the White House plans to expedite the weapons delivery amid concerns that a future Trump administration would halt weapons shipments before they reach Kyiv. Trump has repeatedly said that he would end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Ukraine &#x2014; a plan that may involve ceding Ukrainian territory and creating autonomous regions in the east, according to reporting in October. In June, two top advisors to Trump proposed a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia, Reuters reported, citing the advisors, retired General Keith Kellogg and Fred Fleit. Politico reported that of the $61 billion aid package passed by congress in April, only $4.3 billion remains to pull existing weapons stocks, while a further $2.1 billion in funding remains to put weapons on contract with U.S. defense companies. Despite the president&apos;s ability to deliver existing weapons stocks through presidential drawdown authority, White House officials are concerned that the delivery of the large amount of weaponry may take months to reach Ukraine &#x2014; well past Trump&apos;s inauguration into office. Despite the concerns around the weapons timely delivery, the Pentagon will remain &quot;on track to continue to provide the authorized assistance to support Ukraine,&quot; Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz told Politico. &quot;We expect to have further assistance in the coming weeks.&quot; Mont recently on Oct. 16, U.S. President Joe Biden announced the latest $425 million in new security assistance for Ukraine during a phone call with Zelensky. Following Trump&apos;s presidential election victory, President Volodymyr Zelensky has move to mend previous tensions stemming from Trump&apos;s first impeachment trial involving Zelensky in 2019. Zelensky congratulated Trump on his election victory in a phone call on Nov. 6.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-administration-rushing-to-deliver-6-billion-in-remaining-aid-to-ukraine-ahead-of-trumps-inauguration-politico-reports/	2024-11-06T16:09:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178339692.jpg
Zelensky holds call with Trump to congratulate him on election victory	President Volodymyr Zelensky held a phone call with President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 6 to congratulate him on his presidential election victory, Zelensky said on social media. &quot;I had an excellent phone conversation with President Trump and congratulated him on his historic and decisive victory &#x2014; a result made possible by his impressive campaign,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram. &quot;We agreed to maintain close dialogue and strengthen our cooperation. Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is essential for the world and for a just peace,&quot; Zelensky added. Former President Donald Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5 handily defeating Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump now becomes president-elect and will be inaugurated into office on Jan. 20, 2025. Neither Zelensky nor Trump provided additional details on the call. Trump has continuously criticized the Ukrainian president while on the campaign trail. Trump previously laid the blame for Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine on Zelensky and Biden without mentioning Putin, and has referred to Zelensky as a &quot;salesman&quot; for securing what Trump deemed too much military aid. Earlier on Nov. 6, immediately following the election results, Zelensky congratulated Trump on social media, voicing hopes for &quot;strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.&quot; In his evening address, President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated appreciation for the United States&apos; strong support of Ukraine throughout the full-scale war, urging President-elect Donald Trump to maintain strong relations with the embattled country. &quot;On defense, on the economy, and on the future after the war &#x2013; we have the potential for stronger cooperation,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This is what will make Ukraine, America, and the entire free world more successful.&quot; Zelensky and Trump have a complicated history. A major scandal revolved around a 2019 phone call during which then-President Trump was said to pressure Zelensky to investigate his political rivals by withholding military aid. The phone call led to the first impeachment proceeding against Trump. Despite the past tensions, Zelensky has attempted to mend relations, visiting Trump in New York during the campaign to share Ukraine&apos;s five-point victory plan with the Republican candidate. During the meeting, Zelensky invited Trump to visit Ukraine, and Trump accepted the invitation &#x2014; although such a visit has yet to occur.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-holds-call-with-trump-to-congratulate-him-on-election-victory/	2024-11-06T15:09:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181622689.jpg
Germany's governing coalition collapses as Scholz fires Finance Minister	Germany&apos;s three-party governing coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that he had dismissed Finance Minister Christian Lindner. The decision to fire Lindner over economic disagreements will likely propel the country into a snap election in the near term, as it is unlikely that Scholz&apos;s Social Democratic Party (SDP) will have enough votes to pass next year&apos;s budget. Political instability in Berlin may spell trouble for Kyiv amid the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party &#x2014; known for its amicable views toward the Kremlin &#x2014; who has continuously called for cutting funding for Ukraine. Under the current ruling coalition, Berlin allocated 7.6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in military assistance for Kyiv in the 2024 budget. Scholz previously said in June that the decreasing popularity of the SDP is in part connected with voters&apos; opposition to the party&apos;s support for Ukraine. SPD suffered a bruising loss in the elections for the European Parliament earlier in June, coming in third place, behind the center-right Conservative Christian Union-Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and far-right AfD. Following the vote, Scholz said that many voters do not agree with the government&apos;s support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, which is &quot;also reflected by the election results.&quot; Lindner, a member of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), has consistently seen polling that insists that the FDP will not make the five per cent threshold for support needed for the party to make it into the German parliament in the next election, Politico reported. The coalition&apos;s collapse marks an opportunity for the FDP to break with the ruling government on a number of key issues. German media reported last week that Lindner&apos;s proposed policy paper called for significant changes to the country&apos;s economic policy, including reducing regulations on climate policy to stimulate economic growth as well as proposing tax cuts &#x2014; in deep contrast with Scholz. Initially criticized for its sluggish delivery of military aid to Ukraine following the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Germany has become the second-largest provider of military equipment after the U.S. In October, Scholz revealed that Germany had delivered a package of aid for Ukraine worth 600 million euros ($660 million), which included a fifth IRIS-T medium-range air defense system, armored vehicles, tanks, howitzers, ammunition, and drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-government-coalition-collapses-as-scholz-fires-finance-minister/	2024-11-06T14:31:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2171104834.jpg
Ukraine, US have 'potential for stronger cooperation,' Zelensky says following Trump victory	In his evening address on Nov. 6, President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated the United States&apos; strong support for Ukraine throughout the full-scale war, urging President-elect Donald Trump to maintain strong relations with the embattled country. &quot;On defense, on the economy, and on the future after the war &#x2013; we have the potential for stronger cooperation,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This is what will make Ukraine, America, and the entire free world more successful.&quot; Former President Donald Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5 handily defeating Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump now becomes president-elect and will be inaugurated into office on Jan. 20, 2025. Zelensky&apos;s calls for greater cooperation come as Trump has continuously criticized the Ukrainian president while on the campaign trail. Trump previously laid the blame for Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine on Zelensky and Biden without mentioning Putin, and has referred to Zelensky as a &quot;salesman&quot; for securing what Trump deemed too much military aid. Zelensky and Trump have a complicated history. A major scandal revolved around a 2019 phone call during which then-President Trump was said to pressure Zelensky to investigate his political rivals by withholding military aid. The phone call led to the first impeachment proceeding against Trump. Despite the past tensions, in his address, Zelensky attempted to invoke memories of strong U.S. foreign policy under former U.S. President Ronald Reagan &#x2014; attempting to tie Trump with the former president. &quot;It is not without reason that Ronald Reagan is mentioned so often these days &#x2013; people want confidence, they want freedom, a normal life. And for us, this means a life free from Russian aggression, and with a strong America, with a strong Ukraine, with strong allies.&quot; Zelensky previously shared Ukraine&apos;s five-point victory plan with Trump during a meeting in New York at the end of September. During the meeting, Zelensky invited Trump to visit Ukraine, and Trump accepted the invitation &#x2014; although such a visit has yet to occur. During his evening address, Zelensky emphasized that &quot;it was extremely important for us in Ukraine and for all of Europe to consistently hear the words of the then-45th President of the United States about &apos;peace through strength,&apos;&quot; referring to Trump&apos;s first term in office. &quot;And if this becomes the policy principle of the 47th President of the United States, America and the whole world will undoubtedly benefit from it,&quot; Zelensky concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-us-have-potential-for-stronger-cooperation-zelensky-says-following-trump-victory/	2024-11-06T13:21:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174930490.jpg
Trump to call Putin, seek quick deal to end Russia-Ukraine war, says Volker	Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 6, after months of repeatedly claiming he could end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a day. To do that, he will have to do what he claims he does best &#x2014; negotiate a deal. Ambassador Kurt Volker is one person with a wealth of experience in issues Trump is likely to face regarding Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. Volker served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019, during Trump&#x2019;s previous tenure. In this role, he held negotiations between Kyiv and senior members of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s administration as an intermediary while coordinating with European allies on efforts to end Russia&#x2019;s initial invasion of the eastern Donbas region in 2014, following its occupation of Ukraine&#x2019;s Crimean Peninsula earlier that year. Before this, Volker served as U.S. ambassador to the NATO military alliance in 2008-2009. The Kyiv Independent spoke to Volker via video call a few hours after the election result was called to ask how he sees outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s last months in office, Trump&apos;s return to the presidency, and what it could mean for Ukraine. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: In terms of Ukraine, there&apos;s been a lot already said about what Trump might do once he&apos;s in office, but we still have more than two months of the Biden administration. Do you think we can expect anything surprising from Biden before he leaves office? Kurt Volker: There has been some discussion that I&apos;ve heard within the administration about the idea of making a gesture in the direction of Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, or also about approving the use of long-range weapons (to strike deep inside Russia), something that the Biden administration has denied until now. On NATO membership, we have to be very, very careful. You don&apos;t want to put that out prematurely. You don&apos;t want it to be uncoordinated with allies. We had an opportunity to do this leading up to the Washington summit this summer, and we didn&apos;t do it. So to bring it up in the last moments of the Biden administration now does not seem to be the wisest choice. It needs to be better coordinated. On the use of weapons, however, I think the Biden administration would be very well advised simply to just drop its objections. Just let Ukraine use the weapons we&apos;ve given them. And this can be done quietly, it doesn&apos;t have to be a big announcement. It can be done on a case-by-case basis, if the Biden administration insists. But there&apos;s no justification for allowing Russia to attack Ukraine from anywhere, and to tell Ukraine that they must not strike back.

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: Once Trump does take office, how far up his agenda do you think Ukraine will actually be? Kurt Volker: I think he&apos;s going to make a phone call to Putin as quickly as possible and tell Putin that he needs to stop the war, that the fighting has to stop, and that there has to be peace. And that will start a discussion about how that actually happens. And what I expect to happen is that Putin will have demands. Putin will say &apos;I need this, I need this, I need this.&apos; And I think Trump will say &apos;no, you stop the war.&apos; &#xA0;But I do think it happens quite quickly, I don&apos;t think Trump wants to see this war continue once he&apos;s actually in office. The Kyiv Independent: Trump obviously prides himself on being a bit of a dealmaker. How tricky an opponent do you think Putin will be in terms of actually arriving at a deal? Kurt Volker: I think (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is the most cunning and wily opponent you could possibly have because he has no issues with lying, deceit, cheating, attacking, killing &#x2014; everything you can imagine. Putin&apos;s interest is not a deal. Putin&apos;s interest is to take, he wants to take all of Ukraine. And therefore, if you want to stop the war, if you want peace, as Trump says that he does, then what you need to do is convince Putin that it&apos;s going to hurt him, that it&apos;s going to cost him too much if he pursues the war. And that&apos;s going to require showing much more strength. And Trump has talked about this. He talks about Biden as being a very weak president. And the implication is that Trump sees himself as a strong president. And he&apos;s going to need to show some strength to Putin in order to get Putin to decide that it&apos;s time to end the war. The Kyiv Independent: Can you elaborate on some possible scenarios for how Trump can show that strength? Kurt Volker: I think the first thing Trump will do is increase U.S. oil and gas production, to try to flood global markets with as much cheap energy as possible. That&apos;ll be good for the U.S. economy, it&apos;ll be good for the global economy. It&apos;ll also be bad for Putin&apos;s budget, and so I think that&apos;s one thing that he is almost guaranteed to do. A second thing I think he will do is reshape the Middle East in the sense that he will take a very tough, direct approach to Iran, try to realign with Saudi Arabia and bring Saudi Arabia and Israel back into a common purpose. It&apos;s going to take time, it&apos;s going to be very difficult, but that will make a difference, and it will show a different way of dealing with the world to both Putin and (Chinese President Xi Jinping), compared to what we&apos;ve seen until now. And then, when it comes to Ukraine itself, I think he&apos;s going to seek support for a lend-lease program, letting Ukraine borrow money in order to buy American weapons. It&apos;s something that was on the books for two years and never used during the Biden administration. I don&apos;t think Trump wants to spend American taxpayers&apos; money on Ukraine, but to allow Ukraine to borrow what it needs to defend itself. I think he would be inclined to do it. And if you make it big enough, if you make it, say, $500 billion, a huge number, that should be enough to tell Putin he can&apos;t outspend this, he can&apos;t win this, and that could also point the way towards a settlement.

(Mikhail Klimentyev / SPUTNIK / AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: If Trump proved anything during his last term in office, it was that he was quite unpredictable. Are there any curveball scenarios that you can envisage happening? Kurt Volker: I suppose that&apos;s what Putin is thinking about. Can Putin create a curveball scenario? Can he throw something on the table completely unexpected that gets us off track? Maybe Putin will actually come forward with a proposal that is far more reasonable than anything that Putin has proposed until now. Can that distract us? I think that would be the curveball scenario. The Kyiv Independent: There&apos;s a slightly somber mood in Kyiv this morning. Do you think that it&apos;s justified, or should Ukrainians be more optimistic? Ambassador Kurt Volker: Well, I wouldn&apos;t say that people should be optimistic or somber. I&apos;d say that people should stay determined. Ukraine is in the fight of its life. It has to win. It wasn&apos;t ideal under the Biden administration, and would not have been under (Kamala) Harris. We saw the U.S. being slow, reactive, not willing to give Ukraine the weapons needed, not willing to give them the authorization to use those weapons &#x2014; an excessively cautious approach, one that worried too much about escalation, and not really one designed to help Ukraine win. What I think we have with Trump now is the opportunity to compete, the opportunity to see whether we can get a stronger Western position in support of Ukraine that might actually be decisive. But it&apos;s not guaranteed. With Harris, we knew where we were going. With Trump, I think we don&apos;t know, but we can compete for it.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-to-call-putin-seek-quick-deal-to-end-russia-ukraine-war-says-volker/	2024-11-06T12:52:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/31_8_GLOBSEC_FORMERSDEBATE_KI-3-1.jpg
Ukrainian soldiers react to Trump's presidential victory: Some say 'this could be a disaster,' others complain Biden was 'impotent'	Donald Trump claimed victory in the U.S. presidential elections on Nov. 6, bringing additional uncertainty for many Ukrainian soldiers who already struggle to see the future of the war. Though doubt looms over Trump&apos;s moves in the coming months, his warm relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his September claim that Ukraine was &quot;demolished&quot; and its people &quot;dead&quot; have left Kyiv worried. In his victory speech in Florida, Republican party leader Trump did not directly mention the war in Ukraine but reminded the cheering crowd that the U.S. saw &quot;no wars&quot; during his first presidential term from 2017 to 2021 before Joe Biden, the Democratic party&apos;s outgoing president, succeeded him. &quot;I&#x2019;m not going to start wars, I&#x2019;m going to stop wars,&quot; Trump proclaimed as U.S. media outlets began reporting the Republican candidate&apos;s projected victory. On Sept. 10, in his only debate with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party&apos;s nominee, Trump refused to say he wanted a Ukrainian victory. Trump&#x2019;s sweep triumph comes as Russian troops continue to gain ground in a grinding offensive across multiple axes on the front line, forcing the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainians to withdraw little by little. Moscow&#x2019;s latest triumph has been in the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, where its troops captured Vuhledar in October &#x2013; a town that has been a Ukrainian fortress for over two years. &#xA0; Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, acknowledged on Nov. 2 that Russia is waging one of its &quot;most powerful&quot; offensives since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia captured about 1,150 square kilometers of land (nearly the size of Los Angeles) during the August-October period, &quot;about a quarter more than in the first seven months of the year,&quot; Bloomberg reported, citing its calculations based on the crowd-sourced open intelligence DeepState map service. &quot;I don&apos;t believe in the miracle of Trump&apos;s ability to scare Putin,&quot; said Yurii, a 52-year-old soldier deployed in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. &quot;There could be a disaster if he makes some strange decision, as he has already done &#x2013; for example, statements about leaving NATO, etc.&quot; The Kyiv Independent asked five Ukrainian servicemen for their reaction to Trump&apos;s victory.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Serhii KoniukhA 44-year-old anesthetist deployed in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast Trump&apos;s victory is, first of all, the choice of the country itself, the United States of America. It&apos;s a pity that such a large European country like Ukraine is watching and dependent on how other countries&#x2019; elections turn out. The whole of Ukraine waited for these elections as if they were its own. What about the future of Ukraine? Well, you understand, all this was some kind of pre-election talk between two different candidates. And it&apos;s clear that the Democrats supported us more. There was military support, which will be uncertain now (going forward). But, I want to say that you have to rely on yourself first, not on someone else, not on your older brother, not on your friends, but on yourself. I&apos;ve always said that in everything, in work, business, everyday life, rely only on yourself. That&apos;s why this has sobered us up, but it should sober up our government and all of our people for us to unite and communicate with each other. And we have our own goal. We are not participants in these elections and are just observers. And we have our own president, who has to now take the lead of our entire country, not be dependent on some elections. A 35-year-old, junior lieutenant, artilleryman, fighting in Kursk Oblast Commenting on Trump&apos;s quote that he can end the war in a day, I can say this: Do I want the war to end? Every soldier in the Armed Forces and every civilian apparently wants it to end. But if the war ends at this stage, in 10-20 years it will start again? Yes, It will start again. I think (freezing the war) will be a defeat for Ukraine and all its allies. Then, it will turn into another low intensity conflict, and after a while, when Russia gains strength, it will go to war again. Do I want the missiles to stop flying? Yes, I do! Do I want to go home, because I&apos;ve been here for almost three years here and a year before the full-scale war &#x2014; yes, I do! Do I want the war to start again sometime later? I don&apos;t!

I don&apos;t think that with the election of Trump, support for Ukrainians will stop. I think that, on the contrary, there will be more decisive actions. For example, permission to strike at Russian territory with ATACMS or some real reaction to the deployment of the guys from North Korea. I believe that Biden and his administration are impotent. And by the way, the first Javelins started coming to us from Trump, if you remember. With Biden, America has become not a superpower but a mere tolerator. Maybe I&apos;m just an optimist. An officer in the Ukrainian army First, we congratulate the American people because their elections are an important event for the whole world, not only the United States. It doesn&apos;t matter who the president is because we have the support of the American people, so any administration will support us, too. Many Ukrainians live in the United States. It&apos;s a very big diaspora. They&apos;re involved in U.S. politics. And they help us. Our country is in a difficult situation now, but we look to the future optimistically. We don&apos;t want to stop our fight. We will fight for our democracy and our independence. I think the American people will help us win this battle for democracy and independence. Let&apos;s try to analyze the facts. Trump was the president who destroyed the big Russian airbase in Syria. I remember the Trump administration was the first to give us Javelins. And this opened the door to more weapons from our Western partners. After this, there were Abrams and F-16s, but first were Javelins, which were important to us. I remember a story when Trump was president when U.S. special forces destroyed a group of Wagner fighters.

(Photo by Andre Luis Alves/Anadolu via Getty Images)It means that Trump before was very aggressive politically and had his struggles with Putin and the Russians. So, I don&apos;t understand why some people and some journalists raise the alarm and say things will be bad when Trump is president. I think it&apos;s the business of the American people first, and I think if he is strong with the Russians like he was before, everything will be OK. I don&apos;t think that he likes Putin. Maybe he likes him like a boxing opponent, but we don&apos;t really know what he likes. We will see what he will do. I don&apos;t believe politicians when they say they&apos;ll do something. I believe them when they actually do something. A medic with 17th Kryvyi Rih Tank Brigade I don&#x2019;t trust our politicians because they do some surprising things. It&apos;s double the same with Trump. I want everything to end with a victory, not with concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-soldiers-react-to-trumps-u-s-presidential-victory-this-could-be-a-disaster/	2024-11-06T12:37:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180619299.jpg
Russian war in 'stalemate,' needs to be brought to end, Republican senator says	Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine has reached a &quot;stalemate&quot; and &quot;needs to be brought to a conclusion,&quot; Marco Rubio, Republican senator from Florida, said on air on Nov. 6 after President-elect Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. According to Rubio, as a businessman, Trump will not reveal his negotiating tactic to end Moscow&apos;s war. &quot;You don&apos;t want to be a fan of (Russian President) Vladimir Putin to want the war to end,&quot; the senator added. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. The Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 28 that Trump may aim to effectively freeze the war and reject Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership in the foreseeable future, at least &quot;until Putin leaves the stage.&quot; Rubio, who is reportedly on the list of candidates for the position of state secretary under Trump, described Ukrainians as &quot;incredibly brave and strong&quot; but there&apos;s &quot;the reality of the war,&quot; he said. &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean we celebrate what Vladimir Putin did or excited about it, but there has to be some common sense here. We are funding a stalemate that&apos;s costing lives and putting Ukraine is going to take 100 years to rebuild,&quot; Rubio said. Trump has previously criticized U.S. aid for Ukraine, mocking President Volodymyr Zelensky as the &quot;greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Earlier in the day, Zelensky congratulated Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election, voicing hopes for &quot;strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-war-reached-a-dead-end-it-must-be-brought-to-an-end/	2024-11-06T12:20:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182884019.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv hits Russian naval base in Dagestan for first time, source says	Key developments on Nov. 6: Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence was behind a drone attack against the city of Kaspiysk in Russia&apos;s Dagestan Republic, targeting a Russian naval base, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 6. At least two vessels &#x2014; missile ships Tatarstan and Dagestan &#x2014; were damaged in the attack, and possibly also several small Project 21631 ships, sources said. Dagestan authorities reported intercepting a drone attack over Kaspiysk, a port city at the Caspian Sea around 1,000 kilometers from the front line (600 miles), on the morning of Nov. 6. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation center at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, also said on Telegram that a Russian naval base was hit in the attack. &quot;Russian Navy ships are stationed in Kaspiysk,&quot; he said. The base is home to Russia&apos;s Caspian Flotilla, as well as Russian Marines and Coastal Troops. Sources said that the targeted fleet was involved in strikes against Ukraine, and the 177th Marine Regiment stationed there was deployed in combat in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. While Russian authorities claimed to have intercepted a single drone in the skies, a video shared on social media appears to show another drone hitting its target, resulting in a large explosion. The incident took place roughly 15 kilometers from a local airport, the Mash news channel claimed, identifying the drone as a Ukrainian A-22 Flying Fox drone. The nearby Makhachkala airport has suspended operations for an indefinite period due to the incident, local authorities said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Donald Trump claimed victory in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 6, shortly before crossing the threshold of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. &quot;I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president, and your 45th president,&quot; Trump said in an address to a cheering crowd in West Palm Beach, Florida. &quot;I will not rest until I have delivered a strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve,&quot; the Republican nominee said, promising a &quot;golden age of America.&quot; His return to the White House could spell uncertain times for Ukraine, as there are fears he might withdraw support for the besieged country and cut a deal with the Kremlin. Trump made no mention of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in his speech but said that the U.S. saw &quot;no wars&quot; during his first presidential term. &quot;We had no wars, for four years, we had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS,&quot; Trump proclaimed. &quot;They said &#x2018;he will start a war.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m not going to start a war, I&#x2019;m going to stop the wars.&quot; &quot;I think we&#x2019;ve just witnessed the greatest political comeback in American history,&quot; Trump&apos;s running mate J.D. Vance said to the crowd of Republican voters. In his only debate with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Democratic Party nominee, on Sept. 10, Trump refused to say he wanted a Ukrainian victory. &quot;I think it&apos;s the U.S.&apos;s best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal,&quot; Trump said. Trump&apos;s plan to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Ukraine, would benefit Russia by ceding Ukrainian territory and creating autonomous regions in the east, according to reporting in October. &quot;Trump&apos;s view is he wants to do everything he can to help Putin because for whatever reason he likes these strong men, he&apos;s fascinated by him in particular,&quot; Evelyn Farkas, the executive director of the McCain Institute, said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent. &quot;So, it will take all the will and the fighting of people under him to maintain the existing policy of support for Ukraine and an opposition to Russia&apos;s autocratic agenda.&quot; If Trump does slash U.S. aid to Ukraine, the American economy will take a hit. The U.S. defense industrial base has received over $50 billion in investment due to America&apos;s support of Ukraine, with billions sent to states that helped Trump secure the White House again like Arkansas, Alabama, and Florida. Russian forces have suffered 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 injured, and 717 captured during almost three months of the Kursk incursion, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 6. Over the same period, Moscow&apos;s military also lost 1,101 pieces of equipment, including 54 tanks, 276 armored vehicles, 107 artillery pieces and mortars, and five anti-aircraft weapons, according to the commander. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion in early August to prevent Russian cross-border strikes and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donbas region, where Moscow keeps steadily advancing. According to Syrskyi, Russia has already concentrated 45,000 troops in Kursk Oblast to counter the ongoing Ukrainian incursion. Moscow has also deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the embattled region, with some reportedly already clashing with Ukraine in small-scale engagements. The Kursk incursion was also intended to preempt a Russian plan to invade Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in northern Ukraine, Syrskyi said, citing intelligence reports from May. Russia has been mounting pressure against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast while also advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east at a pace unseen in 2024, steadily pushing back Ukrainian defenders. Kyiv knows of 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) who were executed by Russian forces on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 6. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in embattled Donetsk Oblast. Speaking on national television, Denys Lysenko, the head of the department focused on war-related crimes, said that 49 criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of Ukrainian POWs. The most recent cases include the killing of six captured Ukrainian soldiers near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, prosecutors reported on Nov. 5. &quot;We are now analyzing all these cases, looking for patterns... We are considering all these cases comprehensively and the involvement of a particular armed unit is, of course, analyzed in each case,&quot; Lysenko said. According to Lysenko, prosecutors are building cases against representatives of the Russian military leadership who may be involved in organizing such executions or in failing to take measures to prevent them.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-kyiv-hits-russian-naval-base-in-dagestan-for-first-time-source-says/	2024-11-06T11:31:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/3_6978bf53.png
Ukrainians react to Trump's US election victory	A few hours after Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Donald Trump on winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we asked Ukrainians on the streets of Kyiv what they thought about Trump&apos;s victory and his most controversial quotes about Ukraine and Russia&apos;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-react-to-trumps-us-election-victory/	2024-11-06T11:31:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_7049.PNG
‘It will not be like before’: Ukrainian politicians respond to Trump’s win with caution, uncertainty	With Republican candidate Donald Trump set to become the next U.S. president, Ukrainian politicians have reacted carefully &#x2013; congratulating the former-turned-future president and emphasizing the need for diplomacy and cooperation, while also expressing uncertainty about what his victory means for Ukraine. Most politicians indicated no surprise at the outcome, which was predicted to be a coin toss ahead of the Nov. 5 election, but said Ukraine must now work to shape how the relationship with Washington unfolds. &#x201C;Trump brings new risks and opportunities for Ukraine. It now depends on the skill of the Ukrainian government to minimize the former and maximize the latter,&#x201D; Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine&#x2019;s former foreign minister, told the Kyiv Independent. He described his reaction to the news as &#x201C;calm.&#x201D; As the results rolled in overnight, it became clear that Ukraine&#x2019;s top Western ally will be led next year by someone who has derided providing aid to Ukraine and has blamed U.S. and Ukrainian leadership for the war in Ukraine, rather than Russia&#x2019;s invading forces. His election could become one of the most significant events of the war, especially if it spells an end to the high level of support provided by the U.S. Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, takes the stage during a campaign rally at the Santander Arena on Nov. 4, 2024 in Reading, Pennsylvania. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)At the same time, many of Trump&#x2019;s statements on Ukraine have largely involved rhetoric and are thin on concrete plans, leaving Ukrainians unsure how his term will affect future relations. &#x201C;Everyone is asking how (the election result) will influence Ukraine,&#x201D; Yaroslav Zhelezniak, first deputy chairman of the Finance, Tax and Customs Policy Committee and a member of the Holos party in Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;And from my point of view, the only answer is that it will be another approach from another administration, and we don&#x2019;t know what it means, better or worse,&#x201D; Zhelezniak said. Trump&#x2019;s comments along the campaign trail have sparked worry from supporters of Ukraine &#x2014; especially his repeated promise to end Ukraine&#x2019;s war &#x201C;within 24 hours.&#x201D; He has not publicly shared a plan to achieve this, though the Financial Times reported last month that the plan could involve pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO ambitions. In recent months, the prospect of a Trump presidency has pushed politicians in Kyiv to try and forge warmer relationships with him and members of his orbit. With Trump&#x2019;s victory all-but-declared, President Volodymyr Zelensky was one of the first leaders to publicly congratulate Trump. &#x201C;I appreciate President Trump&#x2019;s commitment to the &#x2018;peace through strength&#x2019; approach in global affairs,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote on X. &#x201C;This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.&#x201D; The relationship between the two has been strained since Trump&#x2019;s first term. A phone call in 2019 led to Trump&#x2019;s first impeachment proceeding, after Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate political rivals by withholding military aid.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)In the years since, Trump has repeatedly criticized Ukraine&#x2019;s president, while Zelensky&#x2019;s responses have remained more measured. Other top politicians, including Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, President&#x2019;s Office Head Andriy Yermak, and Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, joined Zelensky in congratulating Trump on his victory. Several Ukrainian politicians noted Trump&#x2019;s lack of clear direction toward Ukraine and told the Kyiv Independent that they have not given up hope that time and diplomacy will improve Trump&#x2019;s stance. &#x201C;For Ukraine, Trump&#x2019;s victory means both a challenge and an opportunity,&#x201D; said Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Zelensky&#x2019;s Servant of the People party and chair of the parliament&apos;s Foreign Affairs Committee. &#x201C;I hope his presidency will be more about an opportunity than about a challenge. I don&#x2019;t believe that Trump is going to throw Ukraine under the bus because it wouldn&#x2019;t be in the interests of the U.S.&#x201D; &#x201C;At the same time dealing with Trump will require from us lots of diplomatic and political skills,&#x201D; Merezhko added.

(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) #editorialusvoteMykola Kniazhytskyi, a lawmaker from the European Solidarity party currently in opposition, said he believed Trump harbored &#x201C;illusions&#x201D; about dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He compared Trump&#x2019;s ideas about Putin to those Zelensky held before his own rise to power, when Zelensky said in 2019 that he would &#x201C;look Putin in the eye&#x201D; and discuss a ceasefire. &#x201C;Obviously, a lot of (Trump&#x2019;s) statements during the election campaign &#x2014; and not only his, but also the Vice President-elect (JD Vance), and the people who support him &#x2014; could not be perceived positively in Ukraine. In my opinion, they were quite naive,&#x201D; Kniazhytskyi said. The question, he said, is how Trump&#x2019;s behavior could change after the reality of his encounters with Putin. &#x201C;I do not rule out the possibility that the U.S. aid to Ukraine will not be reduced, which is very important for us,&#x201D; Kniazhytskyi added. Some members of parliament had hoped for a Harris win and were &#x201C;disappointed,&#x201D; according to Volodymyr Aryev, a lawmaker from the same European Solidarity party. But Ukrainian diplomats must do their best to ensure Trump&#x2019;s next actions are pro-Ukrainian, he said. &#x201C;We can forget about (Trump&apos;s) foreign policy announcements made before the election,&#x201D; said Aryev. &quot;Trump is a political egoist and he&apos;s unpredictable. The only predictable thing is that he will be doing things that are beneficial to him.&#x201D; Kyiv School of Economics President Timofy Mylovanov, who worked as an advisor to the President&#x2019;s Office, said that the more idealistic format of Ukraine&apos;s relations with the U.S. under President Joe Biden would be replaced by a more pragmatic one under Trump. &quot;I&apos;m more optimistic than others,&quot; he said, referring to the U.S. election results. Trump&#x2019;s victory &#x201C;is not the end of the world.&quot; But even as Ukrainian politicians offered reasons for optimism, many stated they believe a Trump presidency will require significant effort domestically. Some cited a need for less reliance on the country&#x2019;s ally, while others noted that maintaining a healthy relationship with the new administration will take work. &#x201C;The American people made their choice. Time will tell what this will mean for us. But it will definitely not be like before,&#x201D; Serhiy Prytula, a volunteer, politician, and media personality, wrote on X. &#x201C;Regardless of which administration will be in the White House, we must help the military, relying primarily on our own strength.&#x201D; Graves of Ukrainian soldiers during the memorial day at the Lychakiv military cemetery on Nov. 1, 2023, in Lviv . (Stanislav Ivanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)According to Kuleba, Trump&#x2019;s victory &#x2014; and the uncertainty of future aid &#x2013; will incentivize the cash-strapped Ukraine to better manage available resources for its war. Kniazhytskyi expressed a similar sentiment, saying Trump&#x2019;s presidency means &#x201C;we need to be more effective in governing the state &#x2014; internally, in managing the army, diplomacy, and external communications.&#x201D; Since Trump will respond to American desires, he said, Ukrainians must &#x201C;make sure that the American people know the truth about what is happening in Ukraine.&#x201D; Meanwhile, Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a lawmaker from the Holos party, said &#x201C;there is no panic among politicians or diplomats. It&apos;s about work processes.&#x201D; Yurchyshyn said that Ukraine needs to provide the U.S. with a convincing victory plan and show why it benefits America to continue supporting Ukraine. &#x201C;But for this, we need to grow up and stop expecting the U.S. to help us by default.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent journalists Kateryna Denisova, Natalia Yermak, Chris York, Martin Fornusek, and Oleg Sukhov contributed reporting.	https://kyivindependent.com/it-will-not-be-like-before-ukrainian-politicians-respond-to-trumps-win-with-caution-uncertainty/	2024-11-06T11:15:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2173922474.jpg
Ukrainians in Kyiv weigh in on Trump victory: 'He can't end the war fast'	As Donald Trump triumphs in the U.S. presidential election, Ukrainians brace themselves for what it means for their nation. Throughout the campaign, Trump has repeatedly said he would end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;in 24 hours.&quot; He said that he would push Ukraine and Russia to negotiate a peace deal. He has also refused to say he wanted Ukraine to win. Trump&apos;s victory also comes at an especially precarious moment in the war, when Russian troops advance swiftly in Donetsk Oblast. The Kyiv Independent went to the streets of Kyiv to ask Ukrainians what they expect from Trump&apos;s return to the White House. &quot;This is the choice of the American people. We&apos;re a foreign country, so we don&apos;t have the right to say whether it&apos;s right or wrong. How it will impact Ukraine &#x2014; well, time will tell. Let&apos;s be honest &#x2014; this is high-level politics, and, unfortunately, we aren&apos;t a major player in this world. I think Trump will take steps, as he promised to bring it (the full-scale invasion) to an end. He&apos;ll try to achieve a quick resolution. And, as far as I know, Trump has this tendency to compare himself to (Joe) Biden, to look at what Biden has done. In any case, he&apos;ll want to make his mark in U.S. history by showing, &apos;I did more.&apos; He promised to act, and he will. Most likely, there will be (peace) negotiations. I think, in any case, it will be better for Ukraine. He&apos;ll have some positive steps, in any case. He is the president of a great country. Whatever his opponents say, or other opposition, this is a great country with great people. And this is their choice. He&apos;ll likely be a significant president. With all due respect, their elections are more democratic than we have here. He likes his own country, America, more. He&apos;s focused on his country. That&apos;s the main thing. Essentially, it&apos;s normal behavior for any president. He should first consider his country&apos;s interests, then external ones.&quot; Iryna Zavorotnia, 56, has been waiting for her son&apos;s release from Russian captivity for about 30 months. Zavorotnia hopes that after the U.S. presidential election, Ukraine will receive more support from the West to win the war against Russia, as she told The Kyiv Independent on Nov. 6, 2024, in Kyiv, Ukraine. (The Kyiv Independent)Iryna Zavorotnia, 56, mother of a soldier in Russian captivity&quot;My child has been in captivity for 30 months. It&apos;s all very painful. Of course, we hope and want more support from the West so that people aren&apos;t indifferent to our common war. Naturally, the elections in the U.S. are important to me. I truly want more support from international organizations, so we can achieve victory. I&apos;ve read some of his (Trump&apos;s) campaign promises and I am not entirely satisfied with them. The only thing I can say is that he says the war will end &#x2014; but how? In what way will it end? I can&apos;t say. Right now, my priority is my son and his release from captivity, along with his fellow soldiers. I wish at least the International Committee of the Red Cross could access our POWs and that some third-party influence could push this organization. But nothing is being done anywhere, everyone is indifferent. I desperately want us to win&#x2026; Trump says he&apos;ll ensure the war ends. Maybe it will happen. But we must preserve the country&apos;s integrity. Soldiers are not sacrificing their lives and defending our country for nothing.&quot; Sofia Moroz, 17, said in an interview with The Kyiv Independent on Nov. 6, 2024, in Kyiv, Ukraine, that she does not think Donald Trump will support Ukraine in a war with Russia, adding that he has &quot;too many friendly ties&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (The Kyiv Independent)Sofia Moroz, 17, biology student&quot;I saw a very interesting chart showing that the level of people&apos;s education in the States aligns with their choice of president. The less educated people are in a certain state, the more they vote for Trump. So, I&apos;m not sure what to think about this because, based on the information space, it seemed like many people would vote for Kamala (Harris). This morning, I was rather unpleasantly surprised. Trump, as a person, won&apos;t support Ukraine, and he has too many friendly ties with Putin. So, it immediately became clear that he wouldn&apos;t help us in the war. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s right to say this, but his relations with the Russian president are better than with the Ukrainian one. (Ending the war in Ukraine) would be hard to make this a reality because the war isn&apos;t only fought on military grounds and in the information space. In the information space, you can&apos;t stop it in just one day because it&apos;s everywhere &#x2014; in social networks, in various groups &#x2014; and it&apos;s impossible to bring everyone up to speed at once. I suppose we&apos;ll wait and see how it plays out in the coming days, as these days are crucial in shaping people&apos;s opinions, and the noise will be high, so we&apos;ll see. Most of my friends aren&apos;t happy with this turn of events.&quot; &quot;If he (Trump) is going to help Ukraine in this war, I fully support that. But he speaks so vaguely that it&apos;s hard to understand. One moment he seems like he wants to help, then he&apos;s against it &#x2014; I just can&#x2019;t make sense of it. I&apos;m all for the entire world supporting us so we can end this war as quickly as possible and stop losing our men out there. (If Trump would force Ukraine to make territorial concessions to end the war, it would be) horrible. That must not happen. They&apos;ve already taken Voronezh, Kursk, and even Kuban &#x2014; these were once our lands. They took them in 1917. Now they&apos;re encroaching on our lands again. This can&apos;t be allowed. Crimea is ours. It needs to be liberated. Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol &#x2014; all our lands. They need to be part of Ukraine.&quot; &quot;It happens. We don&apos;t know what the outcome would have been if Kamala (Harris) had won; who would have helped us more. Everything is uncertain. We don&apos;t get much help anyway. The main thing is that they don&apos;t start interfering. Maybe something will come to Trump&apos;s mind, and he will start helping (Ukraine) more. Who knows? Maybe we&apos;ll be lucky, maybe not. I suspect that he likes different things at different periods of his life. I am sure that at some point, he may like Russia more. It&apos;s hard to say what&apos;s going on in his head. It used to be difficult to say what our future would be. Now, I don&apos;t think it will change dramatically. There is a small chance that we will get more aid. But it is so small that I don&apos;t think our prospects will change much.&quot; 17-year-old Kyiv student Dmytro compares Donald Trump&apos;s presidency to a &quot;lottery.&quot; &quot;It can get much better, or it can get much worse,&quot; he told The Kyiv Independent on Nov. 6, 2024, in Kyiv, Ukraine. (The Kyiv Independent)Dmytro, 17, college student&quot;My attitude is neutral. I believe that Ukraine will be able to survive no matter who wins. I think Trump&apos;s victory may even be good for us, although it is hard to say. In my opinion, it will be a lottery. It can get much better, or it can get much worse. It is difficult to answer (what is Trump&apos;s attitude towards Ukraine). We need to analyze the worst-case scenario &#x2014; either you freeze the war and leave the territories (to Russia), or you simply won&apos;t be given weapons. For us, this is the most difficult option. But I hope that there will still be support from the U.S., and it will be even bigger. Will Trump be able to settle (the war) as quickly as he wants? I&apos;m sure he won&apos;t.&quot; Oksana (R), 21, described Donald Trump as &quot;an unpredictable person&quot; but hopes that U.S. aid to Ukraine will not decrease, she said in an interview with The Kyiv Independent on Nov. 6, 2024, in Kyiv, Ukraine. (The Kyiv Independent)Oksana, 21, lawyer&quot;Can I swear here? We are f*cked like the Poles in 1939. I would really like to believe that Donald Trump is an unpredictable person, and we will not know what his deepest intentions are regarding Ukraine until the very last moment. And that we have a chance, and that arms supplies at least won&apos;t decrease, or may even increase. But unfortunately, we should prepare for the worst-case scenario &#x2014; the freezing of the conflict and its recurrence in a number of years. You have to go on living as long as you can, as long as you can do it in Kyiv. And then we will see. I&apos;d like to think that our Western partners will realize that we can&apos;t rely on America anymore and will increase their military aid. I think our diplomats will have to work harder to explain that there is no way to &apos;resolve&apos; this war. The only possible way out is a Ukrainian victory. The question is, what will be the price?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-in-kyiv-trump/	2024-11-06T11:10:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/MAIN_SEQUENCE_00_01_48_22_Still002.png
Zelensky to visit Hungary for European Political Community Summit	President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning to visit the European Political Community summit in Hungary on Nov. 7, where leaders will discuss security challenges in Europe amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war, he said in an evening address on Nov. 6. The fifth meeting of the European Political Community will focus on Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion against Ukraine and the ongoing escalation in the Middle East among other things. &quot;We will discuss security challenges in Europe, as well as new opportunities for all partners,&quot; Zelensky said. The meeting will take place a day after Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election. President-elect Trump has repeatedly lambasted European NATO members for not investing enough in their defense capabilities and instead relying on the U.S. He also criticized U.S. aid for Ukraine, mocking Zelensky as the &quot;greatest salesman on earth.&quot; Zelensky was invited to the event by European Council President Charles Michel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The Hungarian leader has dismissed Kyiv&apos;s victory plan and touted Moscow&apos;s talking points. Ukraine&apos;s president is expected to meet with European leaders in Budapest and sign a number of deals.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-visit-hungary-for/	2024-11-06T10:57:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178873740.jpg
President Sandu's opponent concedes, days after losing Moldovan presidential election	Pro-Russian political newcomer Alexandr Stoianoglo on Nov. 6 conceded following the Moldovan presidential runoff vote. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu won on Nov. 3 by a margin of about 55.3% to 44.7%, despite what she called an &quot;unprecedented&quot; election interference backed by Moscow. The Russian-friendly Party of Socialists, who supported Sandu&apos;s opponent Stoianoglo, announced that they do not view Sandu as legitimately elected and will not recognize her as president. Moscow also refused to recognize Sandu&#x2019;s victory. Two day after the runoff, Stoinoglo said that the results of the presidential election &quot;showed that we lost, although here in Moldova we won.&quot; &quot;This is not a final defeat, it is only a lost battle,&quot; he added. Stoianoglo, Moldova&apos;s former prosecutor general from the Russian-friendly Gagauzia, presented himself as a fresh candidate who could unify the opposition. Sandu and some observers said that his candidacy was merely Moscow&apos;s ploy to put forward a more acceptable candidate than ex-President Igor Dodon. Moldovan authorities, independent observers, and officials from the EU and the U.S. pointed to a malign influence campaign involving criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Moldovan lawmakers claimed that Moscow spent millions of dollars backing Stoianoglo. Sandu has long insisted that the real opponent to her government and Moldova&apos;s European path is the Kremlin, which has been waging a hybrid war designed to push Chisinau back into Moscow&apos;s orbit in what Sandu described &quot;a fraud of unprecedented proportions.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/sandus-rival-concedes-defeat-in-moldovas-presidential-election/	2024-11-06T10:16:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181968883.jpg
Russia has executed at least 124 Ukrainian POWs on battlefield, Prosecutor General's Office says	Kyiv knows of 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) who were executed by Russian forces on the battlefield throughout the full-scale war, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 6. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in embattled Donetsk Oblast. Speaking on national television, Denys Lysenko, the head of the department focused on war-related crimes, said that 49 criminal investigations were underway regarding the execution of Ukrainian POWs. The most recent cases include the killing of six captured Ukrainian soldiers near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, prosecutors reported on Nov. 5. &quot;We are now analyzing all these cases, looking for patterns... We are considering all these cases comprehensively and the involvement of a particular armed unit is, of course, analyzed in each case,&quot; Lysenko said. According to him, prosecutors are building cases against representatives of the Russian military leadership who may be involved in organizing such executions or in failing to take measures to prevent them. Former Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin called the killing of Ukrainian servicemen in captivity a &quot;deliberate policy&quot; of Russia. Some 80% of the cases of executions of Ukrainian POWs were recorded in 2024, but the trend began to appear in November 2023, when &quot;there were changes in the attitude of Russian military personnel towards our prisoners of war for the worse,&quot; said Yurii Belousov, a senior representative of the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-summarily-executed-124-ukrainian-pows-on-battlefield/	2024-11-06T09:34:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1770366748.jpg
What we know about Trump's plans for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine	In his speech declaring victory in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 6, Donald Trump made no mention of Ukraine yet alluded to just how consequential his second term in office will likely be for the country ravaged by Russia&#x2019;s invasion. &quot;We had no wars, for four years, we had no wars. Except we defeated ISIS,&quot; Trump said in comments referring to his first term as president. &quot;They said &#x2018;he will start a war.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m not going to start a war, I&#x2019;m going to stop the wars,&quot; Trump added. How does Trump plan to stop Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine? That&apos;s the million-dollar question that is undoubtedly being discussed in capitals worldwide, not least in Kyiv and Moscow. After Trump declared victory, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky greeted him in a post on X, in which he recalled their face-to-face talks in New York City in September. &#x201C;We discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan (presented to allies by Zelensky), and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,&#x201D; Zelensky wrote. &#x201C;I appreciate President Trump&#x2019;s commitment to the &#x2018;peace through strength&#x2019; approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump&#x2019;s decisive leadership.&#x201D; President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (R) meet in New York during the visit to the United States in New York City, U.S. on Sept. 27, 2024. (Uliana Boichuk/Novyny LIVE/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)While Zelensky has revealed a breakdown of his &#x201C;Victory Plan,&#x201D; details from Trump himself on how he plans to end Russia&#x2019;s war have been scarce. Trump has repeatedly said he could end the war &quot;in 24 hours.&quot; Former businessman Trump &#x2014; who in 1987 published a book titled &#x201C;The Art of the Deal&#x201D; &#x2014; appears to believe that negotiating the end of a war is similar to negotiating the price of real estate in New York City. &quot;I would tell Zelensky, no more. You got to make a deal. I would tell Putin, if you don&apos;t make a deal, we&apos;re going to give him a lot. We&apos;re going to (give Ukraine) more than they ever got if we have to,&quot; Trump said in a July 2023 interview. &quot;I will have the deal done in one day. One day,&quot; Trump added. Some lawmakers in Kyiv have dismissed his claims as &quot;election rhetoric,&quot; while Zelensky has called on Trump to release more details on several occasions before meeting him this September. &quot;If Trump knows how to finish this war, he should tell us today,&quot; Zelensky told Bloomberg Television in an interview published on July 3. &quot;If there are risks to Ukrainian independence, if we lose statehood &#x2014; we want to be ready for this, we want to know... We want to understand whether in November we will have the powerful support of the U.S., or will be all alone.&quot; While few details have been forthcoming from Trump himself, numerous reports over the last year have given some clues about his plans to end Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. The very nature of such a quick deal heavily suggests Ukraine being forced to cede land to Russia. In April, the Washington Post reported Trump would pressure Ukraine to cede the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied in 2014, and the far eastern Donbas region it currently holds much of. A source told the paper that he believes both Moscow and Kyiv &quot;want to save face, they want a way out.&quot; The source also claimed Trump believes that Ukrainians in Russian-occupied territories would be &#x201C;okay&#x201D; with being part of Russia. In June, two top advisors to Trump proposed a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia, Reuters reported, citing the advisors, retired General Keith Kellogg and Fred Fleit. Kellogg and Fleitz, who previously served on the National Security Council in the Trump administration, said the proposed ceasefire would freeze the front lines in their current position. At the same time, Kellogg said the plan would entail additional warnings to Russia that the U.S. would increase its military support to Ukraine if Moscow refused the terms of the ceasefire. Fleitz said Trump reacted positively to the plan but added: &quot;I&apos;m not claiming he agreed with it or agreed with every word of it.&quot; Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said at the time that only statements from Trump or the campaign should be taken as official policy positions. In July, Politico reported that Trump was reportedly considering the possibility of making a deal with Russia to block the future NATO accession of certain countries, namely Ukraine and Georgia. One of the sources told Politico that Trump &quot;would be open to something foreclosing NATO expansion and not going back to the 1991 borders for Ukraine.&quot; The latest report came last month when the Financial Times, citing its sources close to Trump&apos;s team, reported that he planned to freeze the war. According to the paper, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, in September outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside NATO. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create temporarily autonomous zones in Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts which would later be fully reintegrated with the rest of Ukraine. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk agreements. The adviser said the new plan will include enforcement mechanisms and consequences for violating the agreement. However, in his opinion, European troops, not NATO forces or U.N. peacekeepers, will have to keep order. Fleitz, a former CIA analyst now at the America First Policy Institute Center for American Security, suggested in an interview with the Financial Times that Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO could be taken off the agenda for several years to force Russia to the negotiating table. &quot;We freeze the conflict, Ukraine does not cede any territory, they don&apos;t give up their territorial claims, and we have negotiations with the understanding there probably won&apos;t be a final agreement until Putin leaves the stage,&quot; Fleitz said. Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have pushed back against the notion of any sort of ceasefire that would cement Russia&apos;s battlefield gains. &#x201C;When (Putin) gains strength, he might issue an ultimatum &#x2013; to recognize all occupied territories, to stay out of NATO, to forget about European integration,&#x201D; Zelensky said in June. &quot;And there will be many such conditions, depending on how strong (Putin) is at that moment. Therefore, a ceasefire is a trap.&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, shake hands during a meeting on September 27, 2024 in New York City.

Following Russia&#x2019;s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow declared its annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts in 2022, including Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson &#x2013; all of which Russia still doesn&#x2019;t fully control. Referring to these declared land grabs, Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent in July that any sweeping plans announced by Trump before he became president are unlikely to go anywhere if he takes office. &quot;Putin cannot backtrack on annexations,&quot; Merezhko, the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy, said. &quot;When Trump realizes this, when Putin is not eager to make compromises, he will be very disappointed because there is no possibility of reaching a peaceful compromise.&#x201D; &quot;(Trump) doesn&apos;t want to be a failure; he wants to be a success, and if he wants success, he has to get Ukraine to agree, and Ukraine will never agree to territory concessions.&quot; Putin&apos;s stated aim for launching the full-scale invasion in early 2022 was to take all of Donbas, where in recent weeks the Russian army&#x2019;s grinding advances have gathered pace. As Russia&apos;s position in the war becomes ever more favorable, the prospect of Putin stopping and agreeing to a ceasefire becomes more unlikely. Moscow has been skeptical of Trump&apos;s ability to swiftly end the war even though Trump himself has boasted of having good relations with Putin.

(Photo by Kremlin Press Office / Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)Putin in June said that as a condition for peace negotiations, Ukrainian troops must leave Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. He added that Ukraine must recognize Russia&apos;s illegal annexation of the regions and abandon any ambition to join NATO. Zelesnky rejected the conditions, comparing them to Adolf Hitler&apos;s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938-1939. When asked about Trump&#x2019;s statements about swiftly ending the war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reports on Nov. 6, &#x201C;Let us not forget that we are talking about an unfriendly country, which is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.&quot; Earlier in July, Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said there is a need to &quot;be realistic&quot; when considering what Trump says about peace negotiations. &quot;We saw the statements. Trump said he would resolve the conflict within 24 hours, then J.D. Vance said that China is a bigger problem for the U.S. than the Russia-Ukraine conflict,&quot; she said in comments reported by Reuters. &quot;It&apos;s necessary to separate pre-election rhetoric from statements by government officials vested with the appropriate powers. If we talk about whether it&apos;s possible to resolve the conflict, let&apos;s be realistic,&quot; she added.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-we-know-about-trumps-plans-for-ending-russias-war-against-ukraine/	2024-11-06T09:09:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180589131.jpg
Ukraine can produce nuclear weapons but its political costs would be too high, analysts say	With the looming risk that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may pull the plug on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine, Kyiv has flirted with the option of nuclear deterrence. The prospect of such a scenario was raised weeks earlier when President Volodymyr Zelensky in October said he had told Trump during a September meeting in New York City that Ukraine would either join NATO or develop nuclear weapons. Zelensky claimed that Trump had heard him and said that &quot;it was a fair argument.&quot; Zelensky later walked back that statement, saying that Ukraine was not pursuing nuclear weapons. However, Zelensky&apos;s statement prompted speculation on whether a Ukrainian nuclear weapons program is realistic from technological and political standpoints. Experts say that Ukraine is capable of producing at least a primitive nuclear weapon within years, although it would require considerable investment.

(Uliana Boichuk/Novyny LIVE/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&quot;I guess everyone&apos;s gonna get nukes. That should work out well,&quot; John Sipher, a retired member of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency&apos;s Senior Intelligence Service, quipped in a Nov. 6 post on X, commenting on Trump&apos;s victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Sipher, now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, was referring to concerns that Trump&apos;s return to power could steer the U.S. on an isolationist path, leaving Western allies, including NATO members and Ukraine, pondering the need to defend themselves without U.S. backing. Ukraine inherited the world&apos;s third-largest nuclear arsenal upon the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, though the warheads had been produced in the Russian part of the now-dissolved state. Kyiv surrendered them under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum in exchange for security guarantees from the U.S., U.K., and Russia. Politically, Kyiv would face tremendous difficulties if it decided to produce nuclear weapons as a deterrent. It could trigger major backlashes from Western allies that Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces heavily rely upon for conventional weaponry to fight against Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, now in its third year. &quot;A nuclear weapon program would jeopardize the relationship with (Ukraine&apos;s) Western partners,&quot; Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I cannot see any U.S. government that would support Ukrainian nuclear ambitions. Thus, Ukraine would gamble a lot of political and military support. The political, economic, and military costs are prohibitive.&quot; In a meeting behind closed doors, that the Kyiv Independent was present at, top Ukrainian officials said that political implications of such a step would be too costly. The Budapest Memorandum has come under fire in recent years because Russia openly violated it by invading Ukraine, and the U.S. and U.K. failed to guarantee Ukraine&apos;s security. However, they have provided massive amounts of weaponry to Kyiv, most after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion kicked off in early 2022. Calls for Ukraine to acquire nuclear weapons are a direct consequence of Russia&apos;s war and nuclear threats, analysts say. &quot;It has become obvious that earlier nuclear weapons were used as a tool of deterrence, but now it&apos;s an offensive tool,&quot; Claus Mathiesen, a lecturer at Denmark&apos;s Defense Academy and a former military attach&#xE9; in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Diana Walker/Getty Images)&quot;Russia has taken about 100,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory and is threatening to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine if these territories are taken away from them. One possibility (for Ukraine) is counter-deterrence &#x2014; acquiring nuclear arms on their own.&quot; Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, said that Zelensky &quot;expressed very well the reason why so many states have sought to acquire nuclear weapons.&quot; &quot;They are seen as the ultimate guarantor of security against a direct attack by more powerful states despite the fact that nuclear weapons are of little or no use on the battlefield and do not prevent the states that possess them from suffering military defeats at the hands of non-nuclear armed opponents,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. Jyri Lavikainen, a nuclear deterrence expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, also believes that Ukraine is &quot;on solid ground when it argues that it needs nuclear deterrence to ensure its lasting security.&quot; &quot;Russia&apos;s decision to attack Ukraine and resort to nuclear coercion starting from the first day of the invasion has revealed the dangers of being left outside the nuclear umbrella,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Nuclear deterrence is needed to counter nuclear coercion. However, the best chance for Ukraine to gain the benefits of nuclear deterrence is to be admitted to NATO as soon as possible.&quot; Although Ukraine does not currently possess nuclear weapons, it is no novice in the nuclear industry. In the Soviet period, the Pivdenmash factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro produced ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Although currently Ukraine does not produce nuclear-capable missiles, it would be easy for Kyiv to make them, a nuclear weapons expert told the Kyiv Independent. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen as endorsing such a program. The Prydniprovsky Chemical Plant in the city of Kamianske in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast processed uranium ore for the Soviet nuclear program, preparing yellowcake, an intermediate step in the processing of uranium ore. There is also a uranium deposit in Zhovti Vody in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Moreover, Ukraine has four operational nuclear power plants in the Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, and Mykolayiv oblasts. The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently under Russian occupation. Experts say that, from a technological perspective, Ukraine is capable of making a nuclear bomb. Robert Kelley, an engineer with over 35 years of experience in the U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s nuclear weapons complex, said that it would be possible for Ukraine to create a primitive uranium fission bomb within five years. &quot;It&apos;s a fairly simple thing to do in the 21st century,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. It would be much more difficult for Ukraine to build a plutonium fission bomb, and it would be harder to hide, Kelley argued. It would take five to 10 years to build a plutonium reactor, he added. President Volodymyr Zelensky takes part in the Ukraine Contact Group meeting at Ramstein Air Base. (Andreas Arnold/picture alliance via Getty Images)In contrast with a fission bomb, a &quot;hydrogen bomb would be incredibly complicated,&quot; Kelley said. &quot;No way in the world would (Ukraine) be able to create it,&quot; he added. Kelley also said that Ukraine might be able to create a crude nuclear device without assistance from other countries. For a more complex nuclear weapon, it would have to buy technology abroad, he added. A Russian nuclear expert and a Ukrainian nuclear expert both confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine is capable of producing a nuclear bomb, adding that it would likely take years. The Russian expert was speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, and the Ukrainian expert was not authorized to talk to the press about the issue. &quot;Ukraine would certainly have the knowhow and resources to become a nuclear weapons state if it made the political decision to do so,&quot; Lavikainen said. &quot;The technology required is not out of reach for many countries, and certainly not for Ukraine since it housed crucial elements of the Soviet nuclear weapons complex when it was still part of the USSR. &quot;Ukraine could develop both nuclear warheads and carrier vehicles since it possesses the necessary military industry, uranium deposits, and nuclear energy sector,&quot; Lavikainen continued. Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, was more cautious, saying that creating a nuclear bomb &quot;is not impossible&quot; for Ukraine. But, it &quot;will take years, a lot of money, and most likely external support, at least on the equipment side.&quot; &quot;Ukraine does not have the industrial capacity to manufacture and maintain a nuclear arsenal; it does not have fissile materials, enrichment capacity, plutonium production, most of the elements that go into a nuclear weapon capability,&quot; he added. Liviu Horovitz, a nuclear deterrence specialist at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, also said that Ukraine faces challenges if it decides to create a nuclear bomb. &quot;Ukraine surely has the scientific prerequisites for a nuclear weapons program,&quot; but &quot;acquiring the necessary fissile materials is neither cheap nor fast nor very easy to do in secret,&quot; he added. The nuclear weapons expert who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the most primitive nuclear bomb program focused on uranium centrifuges could cost around $100 million. A plutonium bomb program would cost around $1 billion, he added. Another challenge is that Russia, which has a vast arsenal of both conventional missiles and ones with nuclear warheads, could strike any Ukrainian facilities that develop nuclear weapons. &quot;It is difficult to envision that (Ukraine) could carry out the program successfully as long as the war continues,&quot; Lavikainen said. &quot;Russia would highly likely prioritize strikes on the relevant facilities as soon as it could identify them. Its campaign to disrupt the nuclear program would highly likely also include sabotage and assassinations,&quot; he added. Horovitz, citing Iran&apos;s efforts over the past three decades, said that &quot;it is rather risky to acquire nuclear weapons when your adversary has both conventional and nuclear options to preempt such proliferation.&quot; Iran has been trying to develop nuclear weapons since the 1950s but has not yet produced an atomic bomb. Five Iranian nuclear scientists were killed between 2010 and 2020, and explosions occurred at Iranian nuclear facilities in 2020. Iran blamed the killings and explosions on Israel, which has neither denied nor confirmed its involvement. In 1981, Israel also destroyed an unfinished nuclear reactor built by dictator Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The main obstacle, however, is the political implications of a Ukrainian nuclear program. Ukraine is a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and its withdrawal from the treaty would cause a backlash from both the U.S. and Ukraine&apos;s European allies, analysts say. Lavikainen said, &quot;The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is a cornerstone of the nuclear policy of the U.S. and every other partner of Ukraine.&quot; &quot;Ukraine&apos;s partners would, therefore, likely pressure it to stop the program once it was discovered&quot; and would &quot;have great leverage in doing so because Ukraine&apos;s defensive efforts are dependent on foreign military aid,&quot; he added. Lynn Rusten, vice president of the U.S.-based Nuclear Threat Initiative&apos;s Global Nuclear Policy Program, shares this assessment. &quot;If Ukraine were to pursue nuclear weapons, the result would be a net loss for Ukrainian security,&quot; she said. &quot;The United States, the West and the majority of the international community would oppose Ukraine &#x2014; or any other non-nuclear weapon state &#x2014; seeking nuclear weapons and would respond by isolating Ukraine diplomatically and economically.&quot; Analysts also say that Western partners are likely to interpret a Ukrainian nuclear program as a major escalation of the war. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and President Volodymyr Zelensky during a meeting in Kyiv on Oct. 3, 2024. (Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)&quot;Ukraine&apos;s supporters in the West would be dismayed, seeing the step as leading to further instability and increasing the risk of escalating the war to even greater levels of destruction, whether within Ukraine or also including NATO member states,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;It would, in all likelihood, create (or exacerbate) tensions between Kyiv and its allies. Unless Ukraine were able to acquire nuclear weapons instantly and present the world (and Russia) with a fait accompli, then the process of developing nuclear weapons is likely to make Ukraine even less secure in the short term.&quot; However, it is unclear how strong the Western partners&apos; reaction would be and whether they would halt military aid and impose sanctions on Kyiv. Mathiesen said that he doubted that Western allies would stop military aid to Ukraine if it started developing nuclear weapons because it would go against public opinion. &quot;So much has been invested in supporting Ukraine that I think it would be very difficult for them to stop assistance,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/with-trump-back-in-white-house-can-ukraine-opt-for-nuclear-deterrence/	2024-11-06T08:12:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161060192.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — 5G and ski resorts	The following is the Nov. 6, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Ukraine is launching a 5G pilot project in three cities over the course of the next two years as it looks to catch up with the global shift to fifth-generation (5G) mobile network technologies, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Nov. 1. According to the minister, the purpose of the trial period is first and foremost to test 5G&#x2019;s compatibility with the operation of military networks. The first trial will take place in the western city of Lviv, and if successful, will be expanded to Kyiv and Odesa, Ekonomichna Pravda (EP), the business publication of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest news outlet Ukrainska Pravda, reported, citing its sources. Don&#x2019;t get too excited. There will be no fully-fledged launch of the 5G network in the above-mentioned cities &#x2014; instead, it will first be carried out at a limited number of base stations, telecommunications expert Roman Khimich told EP. &quot;The deployment of the network will start from individual locations, so users will have the opportunity to connect to the 5G network in test locations,&quot; Khimich said. But also &#x2014; Ukraine has been trying to get 5G off the ground for the last five years, to no avail, and while the country is fighting Russia&#x2019;s invasion and the domestic demand required to cover the costs of implementing the technology remains dampened, it&#x2019;s unlikely the rollout of 5G will happen any time soon. &quot;We also have to take into account what the demographic situation and the state of the economy will be at the time of the end of the war, especially in the post-war recovery period, since all these factors will affect the prospects, and most importantly &#x2014; the need for the rapid implementation of 5G,&#x201D; Oleksandr Hlushchenko, a former member of the Ukrainian Internet Association (UIA), told EP. 5G offers significantly faster data transmission speeds than its predecessor, 4G, creating new opportunities for exchanging large amounts of information at ultra-high speeds. The government is hoping to complete the launch of 5G by 2030, according to Fedorov. Photo for illustrative purpose.

More than 2,000 strike drones were launched against Ukraine during October, the General Staff reported on Nov. 1, which breaks the previous record set in September by nearly 700. &quot;This cooperation will strengthen the Ukrainian defense industry and the protection of critical infrastructure from enemy drones,&quot; Smetanin said. The work between Kyiv and Brussels is expected to expand to technology transfer and the production of missile components in the future, the minister added. Thales is reportedly the only company worldwide developing, manufacturing, and supplying complete rocket systems, including fire control systems, weapons, and ammunition. It specializes in the field of air-to-ground 70mm rocket systems. The Kyiv International Economic Forum (KIEF) &#x2014; one of the largest international forums in Eastern Europe &#x2014; will take place on Nov. 7, with the Kyiv Independent as a media partner. KIEF brings together representatives of business, government, and society to promote Ukraine&apos;s integration into the global community. Register here.

OKKO Group has said it started construction of the Goro Mountain Resort near Slavske &#x2014; the company is putting $500 million into the resort and plans to attract an additional $1 bn from external investors. The resort is set to open for skiing in the winter of 2026&#x2013;2027, with plans for full completion by 2039, and is envisioned as a premium destination to rival Bukovel, Ukraine&#x2019;s leading ski resort. The project was first announced eight years ago but was delayed. The resort will span 75 kilometers of ski slopes. The construction is supported by a partnership with the Ukrainian government through its &quot;investment nanny&quot; initiative that provides expedited land allocation and tax exemptions to enhance the project&#x2019;s viability. Despite challenges from Ukraine&#x2019;s shrinking fuel market due to population displacement, OKKO has expanded operations by renovating fuel stations, establishing rapid EV charging stations, and targeting growth in non-fuel retail.

(Mert Gokhan Koc/ dia images via Getty Images)State-run TV is here to stay, for nowThe Ukrainian government doesn&apos;t plan to stop supporting the telethon, Ukraine&apos;s state-run pool of TV channels created during wartime, before the end of the war, Interfax Ukraine reported on Oct. 31, citing Culture Minister Mykola Tochytskyi. The comment comes after the European Commission criticized the telethon on Oct. 30, urging Kyiv to restore a &quot;pluralistic media landscape.&quot; Tochytskyi said Ukraine &quot;has taken into account&quot; the European Commission&apos;s recommendations. The so-called telethon, branded as &quot;Yedyni Novyny&quot; (&quot;United News&quot;), was launched at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. It was created by merging the coverage of Ukraine&apos;s biggest TV channels. Wrangling TV stations away from their pre-war competing oligarch owners &#x2014; some of whom had pro-Russian views &#x2014; was originally seen as a legitimate response to Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Inadvertently, it also robbed said oligarchs of one of their most precious assets, a big hit to their influence and bottom lines, but a win for the country&#x2019;s &#x201C;de-oligarchization&#x201D; process. But now, the telethon is being accused of monopolizing television coverage, stifling dissent, and even painting a too-rosy picture of the front-line situation. Brussels expects Ukraine to restore the work of all broadcasters in the pre-war format, questioning the telethon&apos;s objectivity. One of the European Commission&apos;s criticisms concerns the financing of the telethon from the state budget. &quot;The state plans to stop supporting the telethon after the end of martial law, focusing on the sustainable development of media infrastructure,&quot; Tochytskyi said. Natural gas production in Ukraine in October increased to the highest level since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, exploration and production consulting company EXPRO reported on its website on Nov. 6. According to EXPRO&#x2019;s calculations, gross natural gas production rose by 2.3% in October 2024 compared to the same month last year, reaching 1.663 billion cubic meters, the highest level since January 2022. Ukraine has signed agreements with the World Bank totaling nearly $600 million under the &quot;Resilient, Inclusive and Sustainable Enterprise&quot; (RISE) project, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Nov. 4. The project is aimed at supporting small and medium-sized businesses, green initiatives, and digitalization, according to the prime minister. European firms are not close to an agreement with Azerbaijan to replace Russian gas flows through Ukraine, Slovakian state-owned gas importer SPP told Reuters on Nov. 1, contradicting earlier media reports that said a deal was at hand. &quot;We regularly discuss the topic with our partners, but the information about the upcoming conclusion of a gas supply contract with the participation of SPP is not true,&quot; SPP&apos;s statement read. The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has kept interest rates on hold at 13%, it announced on Oct. 31. The decision was in line with analysts&#x2019; predictions, Bloomberg reported. &#x201C;Given that inflation has not yet peaked, and that pro-inflationary risks have even increased for the coming months, the NBU believes it appropriate to remain cautious,&#x201D; the NBU said in a statement. Ukraine&#x2019;s proposed 2025 budget passed its first reading in parliament on Oct. 31, allocating approximately 26% of the country&#x2019;s GDP to defense and military spending. &#x201C;The priority of next year&apos;s budget will also be security and defense. All taxes paid by people and businesses will go toward strengthening our defenders and military capabilities,&#x201D; Prime Minister Denys Smyhal said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-5g-and-ski-resorts/	2024-11-06T07:41:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/30_8_GLOBSEC_FEDOROV_KI-2.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Special issue on state-owned railway company Ukrzaliznytsia	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 153 (special issue) of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. In this special issue, Oleksandr Lysenko and Andriy Boytsun highlight several events illustrating failures in the corporate governance of Ukrzaliznytsia. These relate to the core mechanisms intended to deter political meddling in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This issue aims to draw the government&#x2019;s attention to these setbacks so as to prevent negative consequences for this strategically important company. Moreover, the Ukrzaliznytsia case demonstrates that the new law on corporate governance of SOEs, adopted early this year, has had little or no practical effect to date. The Cabinet has not started the selection of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new supervisory board, despite requirements of the new law on corporate governance of SOEs The incumbent supervisory board of Ukrzaliznytsia was appointed by the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision on Dec. 29, 2021 (see our Issue 60). According to that decision, Anatoliy Amelin, Alexander Doll, Jakub Karnowski, and Gebhard Hafer became independent members, while Serhiy Leshchenko, Serhiy Moskalenko and David Lomjaria were appointed as state representatives on the board. According to the law effective at the time of their appointment, as well the company&#x2019;s charter, the maximum term of office of supervisory board members is three years. Thus, the tenure of the above supervisory board should expire as soon as Dec. 28, 2024. Since the formation of the supervisory board in 2021, only the recent appointment of Oleksandr Kamyshin as a supervisory board member of Ukrzaliznytsia (state representative) has been known publicly. According to media reports, Kamyshin replaced Serhiy Moskalenko in this position (see our Issue 151). At the same time, the mandatory disclosures that joint-stock companies must make according to the capital markets law and disclosure regulations of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), are not available on Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s website. In particular, the information on the appointment and dismissal of company officers, such as the management and supervisory board, is missing. In practical terms, this means that based on the company&#x2019;s disclosures, it is currently impossible to know who its key executives are, if the company has a supervisory board, or who the members are. Ukrzaliznytsia only reported Pertsovskyi&#x2019;s appointment and changes to the executive board in the &#x201C;News&#x201D; subsection on its website, without explaining the reasons for these decisions. [See more on disclosure requirements below.] According to the new requirements of the SOE Law (which were introduced by Law No. 3587, effective March 8 &#x2013; see our Issue 122), the selection of supervisory board candidates for an SOE must begin no later than three months before the respective supervisory board member&#x2019;s term of office ends (unless a decision has been made to extend his/her term of office), or no later than 10 days from the day of his/her early termination of powers. This means that the Cabinet, as Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s ownership entity, should have made a decision &#x2013; by Sept. 29 &#x2013; to either extend the powers of the current supervisory board members or announce a selection of board members. Additionally, the Cabinet&#x2019;s Resolution No. 643, dated May 31, 2022, abolished the competitive selection procedure for supervisory board members for almost all SOEs, including Ukrzaliznytsia. However, currently, this resolution likely contradicts the new SOE Law, which mandates that the selection of supervisory board members should adhere to the principles of collective suitability, board diversity, equality of requirements, professionalism, openness, and transparency. The Cabinet dismissed and appointed Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s new CEO and executive board member against the new SOE Law On Oct. 18, the Cabinet of Ministers terminated the powers of Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s entire executive board, including CEO Yevhen Liashchenko and executive board members Volodymyr Krot, Orest Logunov, Anton Mishyn, and Oleksandr Pertsovskyi. By the same ordinance, the Cabinet appointed Pertsovskyi the new CEO for the next three years and reappointed Liashchenko as an executive board member until March 31, 2025. At the same time, Volodymyr Krot, Orest Logunov, and Anton Mishyn were all dismissed from that board. According to the Law on the Cabinet of Ministers that was effective until March 8, the Cabinet had the authority to decide on appointing the CEO and executives of SOEs under its ownership. Additionally, Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s charter states that the Cabinet, acting as the company&#x2019;s general meeting, appoints and dismisses the CEO and executive board members based on the supervisory board&#x2019;s proposal, meaning the Cabinet cannot make these decisions without such a proposal. However, this provision of the charter likely did not limit the Cabinet&#x2019;s power to make these decisions without a proposal from the supervisory board granted by law. However, according to the new legal requirements introduced by Law No. 3587, including those amending the Law on the Cabinet of Ministers and the SOE Law, effective since march 8, the power to appoint or dismiss CEOs and executive board members of all SOEs is exclusively vested in the supervisory board. Additionally, we are not aware of any provisions in the SOE Law, Law on the Martial Law, or other laws that would allow the Cabinet to directly appoint or dismiss the CEO and executive board members of Ukrzaliznytsia during martial law in Ukraine. According to Law No. 3587, the only legal option available during martial law in Ukraine that allows the Cabinet to make such decisions in place of the supervisory board is when the supervisory board is absent or lacks a quorum. However, there is no information indicating that this is the case for Ukrzaliznytsia. Therefore, the Cabinet likely had no legal grounds for the termination and appointment decisions regarding Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s executive board. If the appointment of the new CEO and executive board members is deemed illegal, decisions approved by Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s CEO or executive board might also be declared invalid. Oleksandr Pertsovskyi has been Ukrzaliznytsia&apos;s executive board member and head of passenger business since October 2020. Prior to that, in 2016-2020, he was the COO/First Deputy CEO of Ukrposhta. From 2010 to 2016, Pertsovskyi worked for Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world&#x2019;s largest logistics company. During his six years of work, he rose from consultant to associate partner and head of business development in the Asia-Pacific region, headquartered in Singapore. As we wrote earlier, Yevhen Liashchenko, who has served as the Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s CEO since March 2023, submitted his resignation letter in early October. There were no public comments from Liashchenko on his resignation; however, several reputable media outlets suggested several possible reasons. See Issue 151 for more detail. Since an independent supervisory board was established at Ukrzaliznytsia in 2018, the company has experienced six CEO changes. For much of this six-year period, the company was managed by acting CEOs. Since its establishment in late 2020, the SOE Weekly has covered the four most recent CEO changes at Ukrzaliznytsia. See our Issues 19, 39, and 80 for more detail. Poor transparency and no disclosure at Ukrzaliznytsia, despite the law As we said above, the capital markets law and NSSMC&#x2019;s disclosure regulations mandate certain disclosures for joint-stock companies (JSCs). Even stronger disclosure requirements are set for state-owned JSCs, such as Ukrzaliznytsia. According to the law, they must disclose, including on their websites, three types of information: (1) &#xA0; Regular information. This information includes annual and interim reports, that contain comprehensive information about the company&#x2019;s performance in the preceding year or quarter, covering both financial and non-financial performance information, as well as financial statements. However, according to the law, during martial law, JSCs (including state-owned JSCs) are legally exempt from the obligation to disclose regular information for 2021&#x2013;2024. (2) &#xA0; Ongoing information. This category requires immediate disclosure of any material changes in the company&#x2019;s activities, particularly information regarding: The law offers no exemptions for the disclosure of ongoing information during martial law. All regular and ongoing information must remain available on the website for 10 years after disclosure. Additionally, disclosure regulations require that companies&#x2019; websites have a section titled &#x201C;Information for shareholders and stakeholders,&quot; accessible from the main page of their website, for the purpose of disclosure. Although Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s website does have such a section, it contains no disclosures of regular or ongoing information. (3) &#xA0; Other information. This includes disclosure on the company&#x2019;s website of the charter, ownership structure, supervisory board regulations, executive body regulations, and other internal documents, as well as minutes of general shareholder meetings and reports from the supervisory and executive boards. All such information must also remain available on the website for 10 years in the respective section, and it is not subject to any exemptions during martial law. On Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s website, the section titled &#x201C;Information for shareholders and stakeholders&#x201D; has a subsection titled &#x201C;Other information.&#x201D; However, it only contains a list of regulations pertaining to Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s separate units and representative offices. Therefore, the NSSMC, as the responsible regulator, may impose penalties on Ukrzaliznytsia for violating the disclosure rules. (4) Responsibilities of the supervisory board regarding Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s corporate governance According to the Law on Joint-Stock Companies, Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board is responsible for ensuring timely disclosure of the company&#x2019;s information. Under the SOE Law, the supervisory board is also responsible for the appointment and dismissal of the company&#x2019;s executive board. Despite these established responsibilities, there appears to be a lack of transparency and communication from Ukrzaliznytsia&#x2019;s supervisory board concerning recent events, including management replacements and the company&#x2019;s disclosure practices. This silence raises concerns about the board&#x2019;s compliance with its fiduciary duties. Indeed, the law stipulates that the supervisory board should act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Supervisory board members who breach their responsibilities are personally liable for any losses incurred by the company as a result of their actions or inactions. Furthermore, according to the SOE Law, if the court rules that a supervisory board member broke his/her fiduciary duties, this serves as a ground for the early termination of his/her powers.

The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament, fully adopted draft law #10044-d on reforming the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine. The parliament is currently preparing a draft law for signing. Among key provisions are: The Verkhovna Rada adopted the 2025 State Budget in the first reading. Parliament adopted in the first reading draft law #12000 on the State Budget for 2025. During the discussion, the Verkhovna Rada managed to reject an amendment which suggested raising wages for prosecutors.

In particular, representatives of the NGO &#x201C;Anti-corruption ax,&quot; &#x201C;Center of social control,&quot; &#x201C;Ukrainian Law Society,&quot; &#x201C;Center for Economic Strategy,&quot; and the &#x201C;Institute of Legislative Ideas.&quot; The deadline for vetoing the draft law on tax increases has passed. Oct. 30 was the last day when President Volodymyr Zelensky could veto draft law #11416-d on a tax increase. However, as of Monday the bill still hasn&apos;t been signed. According to our information, the president was supposed to sign it last week. The reason for the delay is currently unknown. The president signed the draft law on plea agreements, the deadline was met. On Oct. 29, the Verkhovna Rada adopted in the final reading draft law #12039 to improve the mechanism of plea agreements for people accused in big corruption cases. The President signed the draft law on 31 October as it was required by the Ukraine Plan for receiving the next tranche of money. The Verkhovna Rada approves the resignation of the prosecutor general. Last week, the Verkhovna Rada voted to approve the resignation of Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin. Kostin submitted his resignation after corruption schemes at medical examination commissions and numerous facts of fake disabilities of prosecutors were revealed. The Cabinet of Ministers has not yet introduced a candidate to replace Kostin. The parliament approved an extension of martial law and general mobilization in Ukraine. The parliament supported presidential draft laws to extend martial law and mobilization from Nov. 1 for another 90 days until Feb. 7, 2025. It&#x2019;s the thirteenth prolongation of martial law since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-80/	2024-11-06T07:18:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1470262919.jpg
Chinese state-owned company reportedly begins refusing to insure exports to Russia	Chinese state-owned company Sinosure that insures export supplies against the risk of non-payment has begun to refuse to cooperate with Russian entrepreneurs, Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported on Nov. 5, citing four unnamed sources from importing companies. Sinosure, a Chinese state-funded insurance company, was founded in 2001 to promote Beijing&apos;s trade development and cooperation. When a foreign importer agrees with a Chinese supplier to defer payment, it reportedly turns to Sinosure for delivery insurance. Trade between Russia and China has reportedly surged by 121% since 2021, underscoring Beijing&apos;s role as Moscow&apos;s economic lifeline. According to Vedomosti&apos;s sources, Russian business has recently faced difficulties with Sinosure. One of the Chinese suppliers told a Russian importer, citing internal policies, that the company refused to insure their deal because of the nature of the exported goods. Another Russian unnamed entrepreneur told the outlet about several cases of zeroing the limit on delivery amount for companies from Russia. At least three suppliers have recently informed another Russian source that their company has been blacklisted by Sinosure, according to Vedomosti. In its interaction with Russian individuals, Sinosure has begun to act similarly to Chinese banks and refuses to insure exports of goods whose list coincides with the blacklist of the large state-owned Bank of China, sources told the newspaper. Since July, China has tightened export controls on military and dual-use products, the Moscow Times reported. Beijing has positioned itself as neutral in the ongoing war but has deepened economic ties with Russia and become Moscow&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods, feeding the Russian defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-state-owned-company-reportedly-begins-refusing-to-insure-exports-to-russia/	2024-11-06T07:17:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/sinosure_2023.jpg
Ukraine's gas production highest since full-scale invasion's start	Natural gas production in Ukraine in October increased to the highest level since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, exploration and production consulting company EXPRO reported on its website on Nov. 6. According to EXPRO&#x2019;s calculations, gross natural gas production rose by 2.3% in October 2024 compared to the same month last year, reaching 1.663 billion cubic meters, the highest level since January 2022. Ukraine&#x2019;s gas production also grew by 2% this year, while daily production rates rose by 1.3%. Once heavily dependent on Russian gas, Ukraine successfully shifted to other suppliers in the previous decade and expanded its own production. For the first time in history, the country went through last winter using only its own gas. EXPRO estimates that natural gas production in Ukraine may increase by 2.2% or 420 million cubic meters to 19.1 billion cubic meters in 2024. Ukraine will not allow more Russian gas to transit through its pipelines to the EU, opting instead to transfer Azeri gas as the agreement with Russia ends at the end of this year.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-gas-production-highest-since-full-scale-invasions-start/	2024-11-06T05:54:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1228384175.jpg
Europe must take responsibility for its security, Polish FM says after Trump's win	European nations must take their security policy more seriously, &#xA0;Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at a press conference on Nov. 6 in the wake of Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election. &quot;Europe urgently needs to take more responsibility for its security,&quot; Sikorski said. President-elect Trump has repeatedly lambasted European NATO members for not investing enough in their defense capabilities and instead relying on the U.S. He also criticized U.S. aid for Ukraine, mocking President Volodymyr Zelensky as the &quot;greatest salesman on earth.&quot; &quot;The winds of history are blowing ever more strongly. Poland&apos;s leadership will rise to the occasion,&quot; Sikorski added, urging European countries to boost defense spending. European nations need to rethink their security policy, with Poland positioned at the forefront of the changes, the minister added. Poland is the only NATO country that spends more than 4% of its GDP on its military capabilities, ranking first in the alliance in terms of GDP share. Warsaw has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Kyiv to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. It has provided Ukraine with around $3.5 billion in military aid since 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly suggested that he would end the war within 24 hours if elected while refraining from sharing the specifics of his plan. His advisors have proposed withholding U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless Kyiv agrees to negotiate with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-must-take-responsibility-for-its-security-polish-fm-says-after-trumps-win/	2024-11-06T05:06:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/sikorski.jpeg
Russia-Ukraine war can't be stopped overnight, Kremlin reacts to Trump	It is not possible to end the Russia-Ukraine war overnight, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a press conference on Nov. 6 in reference to statements by Donald Trump. Trump, who was recently reelected U.S. president, claimed during his campaign that if he returns to the White House, he will end Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine within &quot;24 hours.&quot; He hinted at his message again while delivering his victory speech, telling his cheering supporters, &quot;I&#x2019;m going to stop the wars.&#x201D; &quot;We have repeatedly said that the United States can help end the conflict in Ukraine. This, of course, cannot be done overnight,&quot; Peskov said. He added that he is not aware of any plans by Russian President Vladimir Putin to congratulate President-elect Trump. Trump&apos;s plan to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Ukraine would likely benefit Russia by ceding Ukrainian territory and creating autonomous regions in the east, according to reporting in October. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky also previously voiced skepticism about Trump&apos;s ability to end the war within 24 hours, at least &quot;without giving our land to Putin.&quot; If Trump does slash U.S. aid to Ukraine, the American economy would take a hit, as the U.S. defense industry has received over $50 billion in investment due to America&apos;s support of Ukraine, with billions sent to states that helped Trump secure the White House again like Arkansas, Alabama, and Florida. Zelensky congratulated Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election, voicing hope for &quot;strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-ukraine-war-cant-be-stopped-overnight-kremlin/	2024-11-06T04:39:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Georgian PM hopes for 'restart' of ties with US after Trump's reelection	Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the U.S. election, voicing hope for a &quot;restart&quot; of Georgian-U.S. relations. Trump defeated his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, in a crucial vote on Nov. 5 with worldwide geopolitical and security implications. &quot;I am confident that President Trump&#x2019;s leadership will promote peace globally and in our region as well as ensure restart in U.S.-Georgia relations,&quot; Kobakhidze said on X. Tbilisi&apos;s ties with the West have deteriorated after the ruling Georgian Dream adopted controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law and anti-LGBT legislation and pulled the country into Moscow&apos;s orbit. Tensions only mounted after Georgian Dream declared victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary elections despite widespread accusations of a rigged vote. The U.S. called for an investigation of the irregularities accompanying the elections. Georgian Dream&apos;s democratic backsliding and a shift toward Moscow led to the U.S. halting cooperation projects and cutting financial assistance, deepening the chasm between once close partners. Trump candidate has traditionally boasted warm relations with illiberal and authoritarian leaders abroad. Hungary&apos;s illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a close ally both to Trump and Georgian Dream, has celebrated Trump&apos;s reelection as a &quot;much needed victory for the World.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-pm-hopes-for-restart-of-us-ties-after-trumps-victory/	2024-11-06T04:04:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2162504069.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine injure 37, kill 9 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed nine civilians and wounded 37, including a child, over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 6. Russia launched 63 Shaheds and other drones overnight, as well as two Kh-59 and Kh-31P guided missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot 38 drones over nine regions while 22 were &quot;lost&quot; during the attacks, the Air Force said.&#x200C;&#x200C; Two women, aged 56 and 72, were injured in the city of Kharkiv as a result of a drone strike, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. According to the governor, three men aged 40, 47, and 60 years were injured following a Russian strike on a warehouse in the village of Kapytolivka. In Hlushkivka, a man and a woman aged 48 years were killed in Russian attacks. Five people were injured in Kherson Oblast following Russian strikes on infrastructure facilities, administrative buildings, and residential areas, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. Seven people were killed and 25 wounded as a result of a Russian missile attack on Zaporizhzhia, regional authorities reported. The &#x200C;&#x200C;Russian military attacked the town of Ochakiv, wounding a 13-year-old girl and a 39-year-old woman, Mykolaiv Oblast regional Governor Vitalii Kim reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-injure-37-kill-9-over-past-day/	2024-11-06T03:41:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Zaporizhzhia-Nov-6.jpg
Opinion: Biden's foreign policy missteps weakened the West and undermined Harris' path to the presidency	History will likely judge U.S. President Joe Biden poorly. He set himself a singular mission: to save democracy. But the risk is that his own ego may have jeopardized that very cause &#x2014; not only in the U.S. but across the West. Given his age, Biden was expected to be a one-term president. His task was to defeat then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020, then help cultivate a new bench of young leaders who could beat Trump in 2024. But the trappings of power and his own ego seemed to get the better of him before old age took hold, and by then, it was too late. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris struggled to shine during the 2020 primaries, and her 2024 presidential campaign was always an uphill battle. Her failure to present a clear agenda, beyond opposing Trump, ultimately cost her. She often appeared more focused on avoiding mistakes than on setting a strong vision for the country. Her economic platform was vague at best &#x2014; at least with Trump, his goals on tariffs, immigration, deregulation, and energy were clear. But Biden&#x2019;s foreign policy also weighed heavily on Harris&#x2019; prospects. In fact, Biden&#x2019;s foreign policy decisions have generally been disastrous. First, the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan undermined U.S. credibility, echoing past failures in Iraq and elsewhere. Second, Biden&apos;s team underestimated the threat from Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia, choosing to prioritize China. This almost signaled a green light to Putin, who saw weakness in the West and seized the opportunity to invade Ukraine. &#xA0;Biden&#x2019;s fundamental misstep was in assessing China as the primary threat; while it may be a long-term concern, Russia presented the more immediate existential danger to Western liberal democracy. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dances off stage at the end of his campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Nov. 4, 2024. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Putin aims to destabilize and corrupt Western systems, while Xi Jinping seems content with the global status quo, which he believes will ultimately lead to Chinese dominance through globalization. The West had time to address China, but it might not survive if Putin went unchecked. Biden&apos;s team got the order of priorities wrong. Third, Ukraine could have been a significant win for Biden. At various points during the war, Ukraine appeared poised for victory but needed sufficient funding and weapons from the West to secure it. However, Biden&#x2019;s team consistently showed caution, while Putin&#x2019;s so-called red lines proved more flexible than feared. Opportunities were missed, which only revitalized Putin&#x2019;s campaign and cost countless Ukrainian lives, leading to a protracted war of attrition. Instead of decisive leadership, U.S. policy often amounted to the &quot;highest common denominator&quot; approach &#x2014; attempting to unite allies, but ultimately failing to provide Ukraine with enough support to secure a win. The country was given just enough aid to survive but not enough to prevail. There was a lack of cohesive, strategic thinking on Ukraine. Fourth, the Middle East. U.S. National Security Advisor Chief Jake Sullivan&#x2019;s ironic comments just before Oct. 7 &#x2014; that the region was the calmest it had been in years &#x2014; reflected the administration&#x2019;s lack of foresight. The focus on the Abraham Accords was misguided and showed little understanding of the region. The administration&#x2019;s failure to hold Israel accountable for its retaliatory actions following Oct. 7 also hurt Harris with Muslim voters. The U.S. seemed leaderless in the region, which may have resonated with voters back home. In reality, on much of foreign policy, the U.S. has appeared leaderless &#x2014; and so has the West. Looking forward, there&#x2019;s a nervousness about the incoming Trump administration. With Trump pulling support from Ukraine, Putin would likely regain the upper hand. In the Middle East, Trump&#x2019;s policies would likely favor Israel even more strongly, heightening tensions with Iran. This could bring significant risks and challenges for Europe, with a U.S.-Israeli conflict with Iran increasingly likely. And this isn&#x2019;t even considering the potential for further deterioration in U.S.-China relations if Trump returns to aggressive tariffs. It&#x2019;s fair to wonder if any of this could be worse than the current trajectory under Biden &#x2014; but many voters seem to have concluded it might not be, at least where foreign policy is concerned.

Trump wins Wisconsin, cementing his election victory	Donald Trump is projected to win the swing state of Wisconsin, putting him safely across the benchmark needed for victory with 277 electoral votes. Trump has claimed victory over Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris earlier on Nov. 6, promising a &quot;golden age of America&quot; and a &quot;stop (to) the wars.&quot; World leaders, including Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky, have congratulated Trump&apos;s reelection. In U.S. presidential elections, a candidate does not have to win a majority of the popular vote but at least 270 electoral votes, which are allocated per state based on population. The candidate who comes first in a given state typically receives all the electoral votes in that state. While Democrats have won Wisconsin in the majority of recent presidential elections, the state went for Trump in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton. In 2020, U.S. President Joe Biden won Wisconsin in a close race. The U.S. election comes at a pivotal time for Ukraine, as Russia continues its grinding advance in the east while intensifying aerial strikes against densely populated cities. Harris supporters ran ads in Wisconsin highlighting the vice president&apos;s commitment to Ukraine in a bid for the state&#x2019;s Eastern European votes. The Polish community in Wisconsin represents about 8% of the population. Harris has promised to continue the Biden administration&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s defense, while Trump has boasted about ending the war immediately and refused to say he wants a Ukrainian victory. Trump has also spoken warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who have formed a military alliance and whose troops are reportedly fighting side-by-side in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wins-wisconsin-cementing-his-electoral-victory/	2024-11-06T03:18:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182697515.jpg
Ukraine targeted Russian naval base in Dagestan drone strike, source says	Ukraine was behind a drone attack against the city of Kaspiysk in Russia&apos;s Dagestan Republic, targeting a Russian naval base, a Ukrainian military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 6. The source did not provide details on the possible consequences of the attack. Dagestan authorities reported intercepting a drone attack over Kaspiysk, a port city at the Caspian Sea around 1,000 kilometers from the front line (600 miles), on the morning of Nov. 6. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation center at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, also said on Telegram that a Russian naval base was hit in the attack. &quot;Russian Navy ships are stationed in Kaspiysk,&quot; he said. The base is home to Russia&apos;s Caspian Flotilla. 0:00/1&#xD7;A video shared on social media that purports to show a Ukrainian drone strike against a Russian naval base in Kaspiysk, Dagestan, Russia, on Nov. 6, 2024. (Andrii Kovalenko/Telegram)While Russian authorities claimed to have intercepted a single drone in the skies, a video shared on social media appears to show another drone hitting its target, resulting in a large explosion. The incident took place roughly 15 kilometers from a local airport, the Mash news channel claimed, identifying the drone as a Ukrainian A-22 Flying Fox drone. The nearby Makhachkala airport has suspended operations for an indefinite period due to the incident, local authorities said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-targeted-russian-naval-base-in-dagestan-drone-strike-source-says/	2024-11-06T02:22:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/drone-exploding.png
Russian officials cautiously cheer on Trump's victory while Putin refuses to congratulate	Several Russian officials on Nov. 6 voiced their first reactions to Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election, presenting it as a blow to Ukraine. &quot;Trump has one quality that is useful to us: as a businessman to the core, he hates spending money on freeloaders, on idiotic allies, charity projects, and greedy international organizations,&quot; former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said. Trump claimed victory in a presidential vote on Nov. 5, defeating his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris. The election is expected to have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Kyiv, as there are fears Trump might withdraw support. Medvedev, currently serving as deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, nevertheless said that a &quot;bipartisan anti-Russian consensus&quot; remains strong in the U.S. Congress. &quot;The question: is how much will they force Trump to give for the war,&quot; he wrote. The Republican Party has secured a majority in the Senate in a parallel vote, while the election results in the House are still being counted. Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson of Russia&apos;s Foreign Ministry, said on her Telegram channel that &quot;those who live by love for their country, and not by hatred for others, win.&quot; Publishing a video of Harris quoting a Bible passage, &quot;Weeping may tarry for a night, but joy comes in the morning,&quot; Zakharova added. &quot;Hallelujah, I&apos;ll add on my own.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin does not plan to congratulate Trump on his victory, as the U.S. is an unfriendly country &quot;involved in a war against Russia,&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in reference to U.S. support for Ukraine. A number of world leaders have congratulated Trump on his reelection, including Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and many others. Putin claimed indifference to the result of the vote and once even said he would prefer Harris as a president in an apparent wry remark, while U.S. intelligence has accused Russia of election interference to boost Trump. Trump has repeatedly boasted about his supposedly close relationship with Putin, prompting fears he might seek a deal with Moscow at the cost of painful concessions on Ukraine&apos;s part. His plan to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Ukraine would benefit Russia by ceding Ukrainian territory and creating autonomous regions in the east, according to reporting in October. &quot;Trump&apos;s view is he wants to do everything he can to help Putin because for whatever reason he likes these strong men, he&apos;s fascinated by him in particular,&quot; Evelyn Farkas, the executive director of the McCain Institute, said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reactions/	2024-11-06T01:49:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Russia's Dagestan claims to intercept drone, airport halts flights	Russian air defenses shot down a drone over the city of Kaspiysk in Russia&apos;s North Caucasus republic of Dagestan on the morning of Nov. 6, the republic&apos;s head reported. &quot;The circumstances of the incident are being investigated,&quot; the regional chief, Sergey Melikov, said on his Telegram channel. The downing of a drone in Dagestan comes shortly after an unprecedented drone strike against a Russian military academy in neighboring Chechnya on Oct. 29. While Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov blamed the Chechnya drone strike on Ukraine, a Ukrainian intelligence source said that the incident might have been a result of a feud between Kadyrov and officials from Dagestan and Ingushetia. A video shared by Russian Telegram channels purports to show a drone exploding over Kaspiysk at 6:55 a.m. local time. Local residents reported hearing gunfire and a loud explosion. The incident took place roughly 15 kilometers from a local airport, the Mash news channel claimed, identifying the drone as a Ukrainian A-22 Flying Fox drone. A girl was reportedly injured as a result. The nearby Makhachkala airport has suspended operations for an indefinite period due to the incident, local authorities said. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the incident. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.	https://kyivindependent.com/dagestan-drone/	2024-11-06T01:04:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/drone-exploding.png
Orban congratulates Trump on victory, calls it biggest comeback in US political history	Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban congratulated Donald Trump on victory in the U.S. presidential election in a post on X on Nov. 6. &quot;The biggest comeback in U.S. political history! Congratulations to President Donald Trump on his enormous win. A much needed victory for the World!&quot; Orban posted. Official results of the Nov. 5 vote are yet to be announced, but Trump stands on the brink of victory with only a few electoral votes left to achieve the coveted 270. Hungary&#x2019;s prime minister has been a vocal supporter of Trump since 2016, saying earlier that he would celebrate Trump&apos;s victory with bottles of champagne. &quot;We will open several bottles of champagne if Trump is back,&quot; Orban told reporters during a recent visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Under Orban&apos;s leadership, Hungary has repeatedly blocked aid to Kyiv, pushed for negotiations with Moscow, and spouted Kremlin talking points. Orban claimed &quot;Europe cannot remain pro-war&quot; if Trump wins the U.S. presidency, supposedly referring to EU&apos;s defense assistance to Ukraine, which Orban repeatedly criticized. Other world leaders have joined in to congratulate Trump. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky appreciated Trump&apos;s supposed &quot;commitment to the &apos;peace through strength&apos; approach,&quot; voicing hopes for &quot;strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.&quot; &quot;I just congratulated Donald Trump on his election as President of the United States. His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong,&quot; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said. &quot;Congratulations, President Trump. Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity,&quot; wrote French President Emmanuel Macron. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was &quot;looking forward to working with (Trump) in the years ahead.&quot; &quot;As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy, and enterprise.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarys-viktor-orban-congratulates-trump-on-victory-calls-it-biggest-comeback-in-us-political-history/	2024-11-06T00:37:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1143574041.jpg
BREAKING: Trump wins US 2024 presidential election, foreign leaders congratulate	Republican candidate Donald Trump claims victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, foreign leaders issue messages, congratulating the former president on returning the White House. The Republican Party will also take control of the U.S. Senate. &#xA0;The House election results are still being counted. This will impact how &#x2014; if at all &#x2014; any future aid arrives in Kyiv from Washington. President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election, voicing hopes for &quot;strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.&quot; &quot;Congratulations, President Trump. Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity,&quot; wrote French President Emmanuel Macron. The result is the culmination of one of the most consequential political contests in modern times &#x2014; not least for Ukraine. When Trump and Senator J.D. Vance are inaugurated as the 47th president and vice president of the U.S. on Jan. 20, Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine will be mere weeks from the 1,000 days mark. Trump&apos;s election victory partially answers Ukraine&apos;s nervous questions about what lies ahead for the country&apos;s defense efforts as it continues to rely on support from its largest Western backer, one of the issues that most starkly separated Trump, 78, from Harris, 60. As Ukraine struggled to contain Russian advances in Donetsk Oblast during the waning hours of the election, a consensus remained that Trump&apos;s victory would bring a more unpredictable future for U.S. support for Ukraine than if Harris &#x2014; who promised to stand with Kyiv until Ukraine prevails &#x2014; had been the victor. &quot;With Trump, the basic idea is going to be &#x2014; take any deal (Russian President Vladimir) Putin gives (him), declare it a victory, and try to change the subject,&quot; Timothy Snyder, an American historian specializing in Central and Eastern Europe, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;What Trump has actually said about Ukraine is not that he will try to solve the problem but rather he will essentially try to present the Ukrainians as the problem, and then punish them for defending their own country.&quot; It is unclear how Trump&apos;s at times hostile history with Zelensky will impact the approach he takes toward Kyiv&apos;s wartime needs. In October, when Trump blamed Zelensky for Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine, it was just the latest installment of a fraught years-long relationship. The first major fracture revolved around a 2019 phone call between Zelensky and then-President Trump, which occurred one week after Trump had instructed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Kyiv. During the call, Zelensky said he needed more aid to purchase U.S.-made weapons, in particular Javelin anti-tank missiles. &quot;I would like you to do us a favor, though,&quot; Trump replied, before asking Zelensky to dig up dirt on the family of his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden. Trump&apos;s request for a favor resulted in his first impeachment and a permanent stain on the two leaders&apos; relationship. The two have since spoken in July, and again in September when Zelensky presented Trump with Ukraine&apos;s victory plan in New York. &quot;We have a very good relationship,&quot; Trump said, standing next to Zelensky, &quot;and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin, and I think if we win I think we&apos;re going to get (the war) resolved very quickly.&quot; Zelensky, interrupting Trump, added &quot;I hope we,&quot; &#x2014; gesturing between Trump and himself with his hand &#x2014;&#xA0;&quot;have better relations between us.&quot; But in his only debate with Harris on Sept. 10, Trump refused to say he wanted a Ukrainian victory. &quot;I think it&apos;s the U.S.&apos;s best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal,&quot; Trump said. Trump&apos;s plan to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; and get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of Ukraine, would benefit Russia by ceding Ukrainian territory and creating autonomous regions in the east, according to reporting in October. &quot;Trump&apos;s view is he wants to do everything he can to help Putin because for whatever reason he likes these strong men, he&apos;s fascinated by him in particular,&quot; Evelyn Farkas, the executive director of the McCain Institute, said in an interview with the Kyiv Independent. &quot;So, it will take all the will and the fighting of people under him to maintain the existing policy of support for Ukraine and an opposition to Russia&apos;s autocratic agenda.&quot; If Trump does slash U.S. aid to Ukraine, the American economy will take a hit. The U.S. defense industrial base has received over $50 billion in investment due to America&apos;s support of Ukraine, with billions sent to states that helped Trump secure the White House again like Arkansas, Alabama, and Florida. &quot;Trump and Vance have made getting assistance to Ukraine difficult,&quot; Representative Gregory Meeks, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement to the Kyiv Independent. &quot;We have no indication their approach will change, but a Democratic-controlled Congress can work across the aisle to push for that support.&quot; &quot;Trump played a critical role in inviting Putin&#x2019;s aggression in 2022,&quot; Alexander Vindman, Trump&#x2019;s former director for European affairs at the National Security Council (NSC), told a crowd of Ukrainians for Harris in Philadelphia. &quot;It&apos;s because Trump was a cheerleader for Putin &#x2026; (so he) felt emboldened to launch the war. We&apos;re looking at a world in which Trump and J.D. Vance, the worst vice presidential candidate you could possibly think of, not just for Ukraine but for European security, will be able to do and initiate enormous amounts of harm to Ukraine.&quot; Boris Johnson, the former British prime minister who&#x2019;s been one of Kyiv&#x2019;s loudest advocates, said in an interview with CNN on Nov. 4 he doesn&apos;t think Trump will abandon Ukraine, citing the Javelin missiles Trump approved for Ukraine in 2017 as supportive evidence. &quot;There are folks that believe Trump is better for Ukraine &#x2014; he is not. This narrative that he was somehow the one that provided military aid, that&apos;s not entirely true,&quot; Vindman, Trump&apos;s former Director for European Affairs at the NSC said. &quot;It was the adults in the room around him that really counseled the provision of aid, these folks do not exist any longer and would not be a part of a second Trump administration.&quot; Along with Snyder, voters in the Ukrainian diaspora who spoke with the Kyiv Independent said they&apos;re aware of many Ukrainian Americans who believe Trump was the better candidate for Ukraine, citing his appearance of power and strength. Snyder believes this argument has a gendered undertone as it primarily comes from men who didn&#x2019;t want to see a female in the White House. &quot;This is a big argument, it goes like this; Trump is strong and therefore Trump will make America strong, and therefore America will be able to solve all of its foreign policy problems including Ukraine,&quot; Snyder said. &quot;It&apos;s a way to rationalize what Trump explicitly says about Russia and Ukraine because it&apos;s a big narrative about strength which allows you to forget the details, which are that Trump is historically not at all strong vis-a-vis Putin, he&apos;s extremely submissive.&quot; Trump&apos;s victory comes after the Harris campaign deliberately sought the vote of Ukrainian Americans with a message of security for all of Eastern Europe. However, even within the diaspora, a common argument that boosted Trump to victory is that the Democratic party is too close to communism, according to a Harris-supporting Ukrainian American, Marta Fedoriw, who spoke with the Kyiv Independent and said she hears this from her Republican neighbors in Pennsylvania. The Trump campaign played into this throughout the campaign, with Trump himself referring to Harris as &quot;a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist.&quot; &quot;This is a deliberate manipulation of trauma,&quot; Snyder said, adding that this rhetoric had the power to potentially impact thousands of voters from other Eastern European diasporas. &quot;It&apos;s perfectly understandable for Ukrainians to be traumatized by communism.&quot; For the Ukrainians who are fearful that Trump&apos;s term will spell the end of American support for Ukraine, President Biden has nearly three months to cement his decades of foreign policy experience on a legacy of Ukraine policy. Since Harris took over for Biden atop the Democratic ticket, there&apos;s been a holdout of hope among Ukrainians that after the election, Biden will make concrete moves to aid Kyiv once he doesn&apos;t have to worry about damaging Harris&apos;s campaign. Farkas, who also served as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine under former President Barack Obama, thinks now that the Biden administration doesn&apos;t have to worry about harming Harris&apos;s campaign, they&apos;ll very likely lift the restrictions on Kyiv&apos;s ability to strike deep inside Russia with U.S.-made weapons. &quot;(Biden) has no foreign policy legacy right now beyond normality &#x2014;&#xA0;he managed to restore the idea that the U.S. is a normal country, we do have allies now,&quot; Snyder said. &quot;But if he wants to have a specific foreign policy legacy, it&apos;s got to be Ukraine &#x2014; it&#x2019;s certainly not going to be the Middle East.&quot; This is within reality, as Snyder says Biden could release arms, lift restrictions on Kyiv&apos;s ability to strike deep inside Russia with U.S. weapons, and work on extending an invitation to NATO before Trump takes office. As a historian of Eastern Europe who has studied autocracies, Snyder is most concerned by the things Trump has already said. In September Trump declared that Ukraine is already &quot;demolished.&quot; What he&apos;s doing here, Snyder says, is setting up for when he gets in office and gives Putin a free hand. Snyder expects Trump will project this grim outlook on Ukraine and blame the Biden White House. Trump&apos;s line will be that &quot;Ukraine was already destroyed, and that it was Biden&apos;s fault, so let&apos;s move on.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wins-us-2024-presidential-election-what-now-for-ukraine/	2024-11-06T00:23:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182880212.jpg
Zelensky congratulates Trump on US election victory	President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Donald Trump on his expected victory in the U.S. presidential election, voicing hopes for &quot;strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.&quot; &quot;Congratulations to Donald Trump on his impressive election victory!&quot; Zelensky said on X. Trump is on the brink of victory, with only a few electoral votes left to clinch the needed 270, leaving the chances of Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris increasingly slim. His return spells uncertain times for the U.S. support for Ukraine as some fear Trump will seek to cut a deal with the Kremlin and force Kyiv toward painful concessions. Washington has positioned itself as Ukraine&apos;s leading military supporter under U.S. President Joe Biden. &quot;I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;I appreciate President Trump&#x2019;s commitment to the &apos;peace through strength&apos; approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.&quot; Zelensky and Trump have a complicated history. A major scandal revolved around a 2019 phone call during which then-President Trump was said to pressure Zelensky to investigate his political rivals by withholding military aid. The phone call led to the first impeachment proceeding against Trump. The Ukrainian president met Trump during his visit to the U.S. in September, during which the Republican nominee praised his relationship with both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Only a few weeks later, Trump laid the blame for Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine on Zelensky and Biden without mentioning Putin. &quot;I am looking forward to personally congratulating President Trump and discussing ways to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s strategic partnership with the United States,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-congratulates/	2024-11-06T00:15:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174930490.jpg
Trump claims victory in US election amid ongoing count	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story. Donald Trump on Nov. 6 claimed victory in the U.S. presidential election as projections show him edging ever closer to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. His win has not been officially declared, as the count is ongoing. Trump currently stands at 266 electoral votes. &quot;I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president, and your 45th president,&quot; Trump said in an address to a cheering crowd in West Palm Beach, Florida. &quot;I will not rest until I have delivered a strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve,&quot; the Republican nominee said, promising a &quot;golden age of America.&quot; Trump is only a few steps from victory after he secured the key swing state of Pennsylvania in a massive blow to his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris. His return to the White House could spell uncertain times for Ukraine, as there are fears he might withdraw support for the besieged country and cut a deal with the Kremlin. &quot;I think we&#x2019;ve just witnessed the greatest political comeback in American history,&quot; Trump&apos;s running mate J.D. Vance said to the crowd of Republican voters.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-victory-in-us-election-in-address-to-supporters/	2024-11-05T23:40:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182893951.jpg
Ukrainian-born Representative Victoria Spartz wins reelection for Congress	Ukrainian-American Victoria Spartz will return to Congress representing Indiana&apos;s 5th congressional district, the Associated Press reported on Nov. 6. Endorsed by gun-owner associations and pro-life organizations, Spartz won her district by 57% with a 20 percent point lead to the second nominee. Despite being born in Ukraine, she did not vote for the Senate foreign aid bill that contained more than $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine in April 2024. Spartz was born in a small city in Chernihiv Oblast, and moved to the U.S. in 2000. She became the first Ukrainian-born member of Congress in 2021 and has been known for her staunch support of former President Donald Trump. Spartz has initially supported aid for Ukraine and spoken about the war in deeply personal terms, but also attracted controversy for her attacks against President Volodymyr Zelensky and head of the Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak. Congressional, Senate and Presidential elections are held on the same day in the U.S. on Nov. 5. Former President Donald Trump is edging toward a victory, with Republicans also gaining a majority in the Senate. The election result will have a profound impact on the Russia-Ukraine war. While Harris has pledged to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight for independence, many fear that Trump would cut a deal with Moscow, possibly at the cost of painful concessions for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-born-representative-victoria-spartz-wins-reelection-for-congress/	2024-11-05T23:29:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2020404220.jpg
Trump wins battleground state Pennsylvania	Donald Trump is the projected winner in the battleground U.S. state of Pennsylvania, worth 19 Electoral College votes. This puts Trump only four electoral votes from the 270 needed to secure the victory. Pennsylvania, a pivotal swing state with a large Ukrainian population, has played a key role in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The candidates have campaigned aggressively in the state, with both Trump and Harris holding dueling rallies there the night before election day. Harris reportedly spent the entire day in Pennsylvania on the eve of the election, knocking on doors and leading five rallies throughout the state. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine became a defining issue on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania. Harris supporters ran ads in the state highlighting her commitment to Kyiv in hopes of winning votes from the traditionally conservative Eastern European community. During the Sept. 10 presidential debate, held in Pennsylvania, Harris appealed directly to the state&apos;s Polish-American community while accusing Trump of currying favor with Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;Why don&apos;t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,&quot; she said. President Volodymyr Zelensky even visited Pennsylvania ahead of the November election, touring the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant &#x2014; located in U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s hometown &#x2014; &#xA0;to thank workers for producing critically-needed 155 mm shells for Ukraine. Zelensky&apos;s visit drew ire from U.S. Republicans, who claimed the trip constituted &quot;election interference.&quot; The Trump campaign had also planned a joint appearance in Pennsylvania with a foreign leader. Trump was expected to appear with Polish President Andrzej Duda at a monument at a Polish-American Roman Catholic shrine near Philadelphia, but the event was reportedly canceled. Presidential elections in the U.S. are not determined by popular vote, but by a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Each state delivers a set number of votes based on population, and the candidate who wins the majority in that state typically receives that state&apos;s total electoral votes. Historically a tossup state, Pennsylvania&apos;s electoral votes went to Democrats in the six presidential elections leading up to 2016. The state flipped for Trump in 2016, but Biden won by 1.2% in 2020. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/draft-pennsylvania/	2024-11-05T23:08:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181826310.jpg
Russia has suffered 20,800 casualties in Kursk Oblast, Syrskyi claims	Russian forces have suffered 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 injured, and 717 captured during almost three months of the Kursk incursion, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 6. Over the same period, Moscow&apos;s military also lost 1,101 pieces of equipment, including 54 tanks, 276 armored vehicles, 107 artillery pieces and mortars, and five anti-aircraft weapons, according to the commander. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion in early August to prevent Russian cross-border strikes and draw Russian forces away from the embattled Donbas region, where Moscow keeps steadily advancing. According to Syrskyi, Russia has already concentrated 45,000 troops in Kursk Oblast to counter the ongoing Ukrainian incursion. Moscow has also deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the embattled region, with some reportedly already clashing with Ukraine in small-scale engagements. The Kursk incursion was also intended to preempt a Russian plan to invade Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in northern Ukraine, Syrskyi said, citing intelligence reports from May. Russia has been mounting pressure against the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast while also advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east at a pace unseen in 2024, steadily pushing back Ukrainian defenders.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-suffered-20-800-casualties-in-kursk-oblast-syrskyi-claims/	2024-11-05T22:54:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1550364525.jpg
China's support 'keeps Putin's army in the field in Ukraine,' Australia's intelligence chief says	Beijing&apos;s &quot;massive provision&quot; of dual-use goods, as well as diplomatic and economic support, allow Russia to continue its war against Ukraine, the chief of Australia&apos;s intelligence agency said on Nov. 6, Reuters reported. Beijing&apos;s support is &quot;killing innocent Ukrainians just as surely as if they were providing artillery ammunition and missiles,&quot; Andrew Shearer, the chief of the Office of National Intelligence, said at a conference in Canberra. Despite claiming neutrality, China has been the leading source of dual-use goods, feeding Russia&apos;s defense industry and supporting Moscow against Western sanctions. &quot;This is a profoundly troubling strategic development and we are all grappling to catch up with it and put in place effective measures, but I think this is one of the strategic challenges of our time,&quot; Shearer said. Chinese companies have been sanctioned by the U.S. for producing drones used in Russia&apos;s war. Various countries have accused China of aiding Russia by providing machine tools, weapons technology, satellite imagery, semiconductors, and other dual-use technologies. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that intelligence data indicates that &quot;China is actively helping Russia drag out this war.&quot; Russia&apos;s war is also receiving support from Iran in the form of drones and missiles, while North Korea has dispatched over 10,000 soldiers to join the war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinas-support-keeps-putins-army-in-the-field-in-ukraine-australias-intelligence-chief-says/	2024-11-05T22:37:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152601390.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 702,900 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 702,900 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 6. This number includes 1,250 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,214 tanks, 18,592 armored fighting vehicles, 28,333 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,170 artillery systems, 1,245 multiple launch rocket systems, 996 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,366 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-702-900-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-05T22:12:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2176223422.jpg
Trump wins battleground state of Georgia	Former U.S. President Donald Trump is the projected winner in the battleground state of Georgia. The state&apos;s 16 electoral votes lend Trump a significant advantage in the race against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump&apos;s latest win narrows Harris&apos;s path to the 270 electoral votes required to secure the White House, requiring her to prevail in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. In U.S. presidential elections, a candidate does not have to win a majority of the popular vote, but a majority of electoral votes, which are allocated per state based on population. The election is expected to come down to pivotal races in a handful of states, including Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Trump was recently declared the projected winner in the swing state of North Carolina. Trump and Harris campaigned aggressively in Georgia, both making appearances in the state in the days leading up to the election. The state has become increasingly competitive in recent years, transforming from a Republican stronghold to a hotly contested battleground. &#xA0; Georgia voted Republican in the majority of presidential races from 1972 through 2016. In 2020, U.S. President Joe Biden defeated Trump by just 0.2%, the narrowest victory margin in the election. Voting in Georgia on Nov. 5 was impacted by bomb threats at polling stations. U.S. intelligence officials are investigating an email account with a Russian internet domain as the possible source of non-credible threats in Georgia, CNN reported. &#xA0; Some polling centers in heavily Democratic districts in the state were evacuated due to bomb threats. Voting hours were extended at these sites to account for the disruption. U.S. intelligence agencies have sounded the alarm on Russian election interference for months, with officials warning that disruption attempts might escalate on election day. The election result will have a profound impact on the Russia-Ukraine war. While Harris has pledged to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight for independence, many fear that Trump would cut a deal with Moscow, possibly at the cost of painful concessions for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wins-georgia/	2024-11-05T21:42:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182137512.jpg
Republicans take back US Senate	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. The Republican party has won control of the U.S. Senate, according to projected election results on Nov. 5. The win costs Democrats their one-seat majority in the Senate. In recent months, polling momentum has shifted towards Republicans, seen as the favorites take the Senate in November. Republicans lost control of the chamber in the 2022 midterm elections when Democrats won 50 seats, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote as President of the Senate. Republican Bernie Moreno managed to oust Democrat Sherrod Brown in Ohio, while Jim Justice picked up a Senate seat in West Virginia. The final results are still being determined. It is not immediately clear who will replace outgoing leader Mitch McConnel as the new Senate Majority Leader. McConnell of Kentucky, who is the longest-serving Senate caucus leader in history, said on Feb. 28 that he will step down in November. Over the past two years, McConnell has been vocal in urging for military aid to Ukraine while criticizing President Joe Biden&apos;s perceived delays in providing support. He previously emphasized the economic benefits of aiding Ukraine, highlighting how such funding also supports American defense manufacturers and creates jobs across multiple states. Potential successors to McConnell, such as Senators John Thune, John Cornyn, and John Barrasso, may bring differing perspectives on ongoing support for Ukraine, potentially impacting future decisions on aiding the embattled country. U.S. Senators have by and large been supportive of providing Ukraine with additional military aid &#x2014; in large contrast with the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives who played a larger role in attempting to block a $61 billion Ukraine aid package from passing earlier in 2024. The bill was ultimately approved in the Senate with 79 votes in favor and 18 against in the U.S. Senate, with tighter margins in the House. The contest over the U.S. House of Representatives is still ongoing, as is the presidential race. Former U.S. President Donald Trump was declared the presumptive winner in the swing state of North Carolina, but votes are still being tallied in key states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, and Wisconsin.	https://kyivindependent.com/republicans-win-us-senate/	2024-11-05T21:31:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1754907256.jpg
Trump wins key US state of North Carolina	Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is the projected winner in the key state of North Carolina, worth 16 votes in the Electoral College. With 90% of votes tallied, Trump led Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris 50.8% to 48%. The projection marks the first call of a major swing state in the Nov. 5 presidential election. In U.S. presidential elections, a candidate does not have to win a majority of the popular vote, but a majority of electoral votes, which are allocated per state based on population. A candidate must secure 270 electoral votes in order to win an election. North Carolina is one of a handful of pivotal states expected to determine the next U.S. president. The other key battlegrounds include Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. Donald Trump won North Carolina&apos;s electoral votes in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. The election result will have a profound impact on the Russia-Ukraine war. While Harris has pledged to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight for independence, many fear that Trump would cut a deal with Moscow, possibly at the cost of painful concessions for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wins-key-us-state-of-north-carolina/	2024-11-05T20:56:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182893951.jpg
Chinese accounts linked to Russian election disinformation	Chinese accounts helped spread Russian disinformation campaigns aimed at undermining the U.S. 2024 elections, according to research from the Atlantic Council published Nov. 4. U.S. intelligence agencies have recently warned that foreign adversaries are engaging in influence campaigns to mislead voters ahead of and during the 2024 election. Analysts at the Atlantic Council&apos;s Digital Forensic Research Lab identified multiple videos linked to Russia disseminating false reports about voting. Fake social media accounts in China helped amplify these videos, researchers said. These accounts previously focused on pro-China propaganda and only recently pivoted to the U.S. election. A U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report on Oct. 2 said that Russia, China, and Iran posed the most significant threats to the integrity of the upcoming presidential election. The report came a month after the U.S. announced a sweeping crackdown on Russian propaganda outlets due to alleged election interference. As U.S. voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5, some Russian interference tactics moved beyond online disinformation into disruptions at polling sites. Bomb threats originating in Russia targeted polling centers in several key states, causing evacuations at some locations. The 2024 presidential election holds high stakes for Ukraine. The future of U.S. aid to Kyiv is on the line, with the two candidates delivering sharply different messages on their hopes for Ukraine&apos;s future.	https://kyivindependent.com/chinese-accounts-linked-to-russian-election-disinformation/	2024-11-05T19:00:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153185709.jpg
Google responds to claims map images revealed locations of Ukrainian weapons	Google Maps images showing the locations of Ukrainian weapons systems were in fact over a year old and came from publicly available service, Google told European Pravda on Nov. 5. The comments came in response to reports from Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, that the tech giant&apos;s online map service revealed the locations of Ukrainian weapons systems in recently updated images. &quot;These satellite images were taken more than a year ago and come from publicly available sources &#x2014; we deliberately do not publish the latest images of war zones,&quot; Google&apos;s press service said in a comment to European Pravda. &quot;We take such requests very seriously and are in constant communication with Ukrainian officials.&quot; Kovalenko said on Nov. 3 that images of Ukrainian defense infrastructure were visible on Google Maps and that Russian forces were &quot;actively dispersing&quot; the images. According to Kovalenko, Google representatives contacted Ukraine to resolve the issue after public outcry over the images. &quot;In the future, we will also talk about how to solve any (similar) problems quickly,&quot; Kovalenko said.	https://kyivindependent.com/google-responds-to-claims-map-images-revealed-locations-of-ukrainian-weapons/	2024-11-05T18:06:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150745043.jpg
Sweden unveils new aid package for Ukraine worth over $9 million	Sweden will provide Ukraine with a new aid package valued at nine million euros ($9.8 million), which includes two vessels designed to enhance maritime security. Sweden&apos;s Minister of Civil Defense, Carl-Oskar Bohlin, made the announcement during a joint briefing with Ukraine&apos;s Minister of Internal Affairs, Ihor Klymenko on Nov. 5. Bohlin explained that the package will see two ships transferred to the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. Additionally, Sweden will supply 40,000 protective masks and respirators to support the State Emergency Service personnel. &quot;We are observing the situation and recognize that Ukraine is fighting for the entire civilized world. And we will continue to support you fully, because the security of the whole of Europe depends on you,&quot; Bohlin said. He also emphasized Sweden&apos;s intention to deepen cooperation between Ukrainian and Swedish ministries. &quot;We share your vision of the security situation, which certainly has an impact on Sweden. In addition, we want to learn from your experience in order to strengthen our security capabilities as well,&quot; Bohlin added. On Oct. 28, Sweden announced a military aid package of 729 million Swedish krona (around $68 million) for Ukraine. The announcement came during the fourth Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit in Iceland, where President Volodymyr Zelensky met with the prime ministers of Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. Of the total, $46.5 million will support Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, while $21.6 million will aid the development of Ukraine&apos;s defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-unveils-new-aid-package-for-ukraine-worth-over-9-million/	2024-11-05T16:57:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156168873.jpg
Putin appoints Ukraine war veteran as governor of Tambov region	Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed a Ukraine war veteran to govern one of Russia&#x2019;s regions, marking the highest position awarded to a participant in the full-scale invasion so far. This move aligns with the Kremlin&#x2019;s efforts to build a &quot;new elite&quot; of patriotic workers and soldiers, reflecting the growing militarization of Russian society. Yevgeny Pervyshov, a former mayor of Krasnodar, a southern Russian city, was named interim governor of Tambov, located approximately 460 kilometers (about 286 miles) southeast of Moscow. Pervyshov &#x2014; who is also a State Duma deputy &#x2014; volunteered to fight in Ukraine in November 2022 and was later selected for Putin&apos;s &quot;Time of Heroes&quot; program, which aims to elevate war veterans into influential civil service roles. Pervyshov&#x2019;s appointment highlights how the Kremlin is framing the war as an opportunity to replace traditional oligarchic elites with more patriotic figures, positioning soldiers and workers as the new face of power. This strategy is also seen as a tool to incentivize more men to enlist, with the promise of a potential path to political power and prestigious jobs in peacetime, according to the Washington Post. The program has led to the appointment of several veterans into various government positions, including regional ministers and managers of defense contractors. While the program is framed as an opportunity for veterans to advance their careers, the reality is that it is primarily a way to reward those who have ties to Russia&#x2019;s military elite. Many of the soldiers involved in the program come from specialized units, like BARS Kaskad, which allow elites to avoid frontline service while maintaining a connection to the military. According to British intelligence, BARS Kaskad members are typically kept away from active combat, ensuring their safety and potentially gaining favor with the Kremlin.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-appoints-war-veteran-as-governor-of-tambov-region-reflecting-growing-prestige-of-military/	2024-11-05T15:47:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179663754.jpg
Russia launches record number of drones in October, General Staff reports	Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. This number represents a sharp rise compared to earlier months, when 1,133 Shahed-type drones were launched over Ukraine from May to July. October also marked a record-high month for Russia&#x2019;s drone deployments with over 2,000 drones launched. President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Western allies to apply more sanctions against the providers of components used in Russian drones. &quot;This volume of &apos;Shahed&apos; drones means over 170,000 components that should have been blocked from reaching Russia,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address on Nov. 2. &quot;Microchips, microcontrollers, processors, and many other parts are essential for enabling this terror.&quot; &quot;All of these are supplied to Russia from abroad, unfortunately, from companies in China, Europe, and America&#x2014;a multitude of small but significant contributions to Russia&#x2019;s ongoing terror,&quot; Zelensky added. Between August and October, Ukrainian air defense forces intercepted and destroyed 3,063 of 4,300 drones, achieving a success rate of 71% through coordinated defense efforts. During the same period, the Air Force also reported that 1,052 drones, or 24% of those launched, were &quot;locally lost,&quot; vanishing from radar &#x2014; presumably due to electronic warfare measures or other disruptions. The General Staff noted that only five percent of Russian drones reached their intended targets during this time frame, although drones shot down by air defenses can still cause damage or destruction upon falling. Russia has launched tens of thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-record-number-of-drones-in-october-general-staff-reports/	2024-11-05T14:28:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1244032825.jpg
Bomb threats across multiple states traced to Russian email domains, FBI says	As Americans head to the polls on Nov. 5, the FBI has announced that bomb threats targeting polling sites in multiple states appear to have originated from Russian email domains. The agency clarified that none of these threats have been deemed credible. U.S. intelligence agencies and Microsoft have recently warned that foreign adversaries are engaging in influence campaigns to mislead voters ahead of and during the 2024 election. Both the U.S. government and Microsoft have indicated that Russia favors former President Donald Trump, while Iran supports Vice President Kamala Harris. &quot;The FBI is aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states, many of which appear to originate from Russian email domains. None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,&quot; the agency stated. U.S. intelligence officials are also investigating an email account with a Russian internet domain as the possible source of non-credible Election Day bomb threats in Georgia, CNN reported. &#xA0; The FBI has been cautioning the public about several misleading videos circulating on social media that contain inaccurate information about the election.	https://kyivindependent.com/bomb-threats-across-multiple-states-traced-to-russian-email-domains-fbi-says/	2024-11-05T12:51:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183129036.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Kyiv confirms first battles between Ukrainian and North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast	Key developments on Nov. 5: The first clashes between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and North Korean soldiers have already taken place in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed on Nov. 5 in an interview with South Korean TV channel KBS. North Korea deployed 11,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the day before, citing Ukraine&apos;s intelligence report. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, also claimed on Nov. 4 that the first North Korean soldiers stationed in this area have come under fire. &quot;We are identifying clashes with North Korean forces, but we believe there will be more fighting in the next few weeks, and we will continue to analyze and revise accordingly,&quot; Umerov said. The clashes were small-scale, according to Umerov. The minister added that the DPRK soldiers were &quot;disguised as Buryats&quot; (an Asian people group inside Russia&apos;s borders) and mixed with Russian soldiers, so all the identities need to be checked to confirm the exact number of their losses and prisoners. Kyiv expects five units of 3,000 people each to be deployed along the 1,500-kilometer front line. This will bring the total number of North Koreans involved in the war to 15,000. The Russian border region has seen heavy battles since Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive in early August. Moscow has deployed North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast to reinforce lines there while its most experienced units continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are gathering. According to Zelensky, Russia has confirmed to the West the involvement of Pyongyang&apos;s forces in the war. The recruitment center of the Ukrainian Legion in Poland has received over 500 applications in a month from Ukrainians living in 30 countries, Ukrinform reported on Nov. 5, citing the center&apos;s officials. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first volunteer recruitment center was opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in the eastern Polish city of Lublin. The unit is part of an effort to replenish the ranks of Ukraine&apos;s military as the all-out war with Russia goes on for over two and half years. Most applications came from Poland and Czechia, but Ukrainians living in the U.K., Ireland, the U.S., and Canada also submitted requests, Ukrinform wrote. While the center&apos;s officials believe that not all applicants will end up signing a contract, they deem the turnout to be a good first result. The legion will allow Ukrainians to join the fight while being able to return to Poland after completing their service. Under martial law instituted in 2022 after the start of the full-scale war, Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are not permitted to leave Ukraine without permission. The U.N. estimates that 6.7 million Ukrainians were driven abroad as a result of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. This is in addition to a sizeable diaspora living in Europe, the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere since before 2022. The first volunteers are expected to sign a contract before the end of the year and begin training in Polish training grounds. Around 90% of the applicants were men, and roughly 80% had no previous military experience, Ukrinform reported. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) and three key allies have expressed &quot;grave concerns&quot; over North Korea&apos;s military deployment in Russia and are working on a &quot;coordinated response,&quot; according to the joint statement published on Nov. 5. Besides the G7 members, including the U.S., Japan, Italy, the U.K., Germany, France, Canada, and the High Representative of the European Union, the statement was also signed by South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. &quot;Several thousands of DPRK troops have been deployed to Russia. The DPRK&apos;s direct support for Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine, besides showing Russia&apos;s desperate efforts to compensate its losses, would mark a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific peace and security,&quot; the statement read. &quot;It would be a further breach of international law, including the most fundamental principles of the U.N. Charter.&quot; Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) and three key allies have expressed &quot;grave concerns&quot; over North Korea&apos;s military deployment in Russia and are working on a &quot;coordinated response,&quot; according to the joint statement published on Nov. 5.

Charter.&quot; By asking Poland to shoot down Russian missiles over Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky is attempting to get Warsaw involved in the war, Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said in an interview with Radio ZET on Nov. 4. Gawkowski&apos;s comments came amid a growing diplomatic spat between Kyiv and Warsaw, revolving around the Polish support for Ukraine as well as historical grievances. &quot;Zelensky wants Poland to shoot missiles over Ukraine, which means he wants Poland to enter the war, which means he wants Poland to be at war with Russia,&quot; said Gawkowski, who also serves as the digital affairs minister for the co-governing Left coalition. &quot;By these statements, Zelensky wants to drag Poland into the war with Russia.&quot; Zelensky recently criticized Poland for not yet providing its remaining MiG-29 fighter jets despite previous agreements. The president also said he had &quot;constantly asked&quot; Poland to shoot down Russian missiles flying in its direction, particularly to protect the gas storage facility in the town of Stryi in Ukraine&apos;s Lviv Oblast, located nearly 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the Ukrainian-Polish border. Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine but have never been intercepted by the Polish military. Poland&apos;s allies advised the government to exercise restraint when dealing with unidentified airspace violations, according to Warsaw. &quot;I feel that the last words that came from President Zelensky are unworthy of a politician who owes Poland a lot,&quot; Gawkowski reacted. &quot;The equipment that was transferred, the citizens who were taken care of... Poland is a great friend of Ukraine, a transport hub. It seemed to me that in such situations, you say &#xA0;&apos;thank you.&apos;&quot; Poland has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Kyiv to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. It has also provided Ukraine with around $3.5 billion in military aid since 2022 and hosts close to 1 million Ukrainian refugees. Yet, bilateral relations are far from perfect, with the two countries sharing long-standing unresolved grievances. Some of the recent disputes centered around the resolution of the Volyn massacre carried out by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army against Poles during World War II in 1943-44. Gawkowski was not the only Polish official to respond to Zelensky&apos;s criticism. Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski commented that his country has done more for Kyiv &quot;than any other nation.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re trying to help, but we&apos;re also a front-line country. Russia also threatens us, and not everything is possible,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-kyiv-confirms-first-battles-between-ukrainian-and-north-korean-soldiers-in-kursk-oblast/	2024-11-05T11:52:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Zelensky used talk with Trump about nuclear weapons as leverage before crucial US election, analysts say	With Ukraine&apos;s future hanging in the balance ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, Ukraine&#x2019;s president turned up the heat, invoking the specter of nuclear weapons to nudge whoever lands in the Oval Office toward offering more conventional weaponry and robust security guarantees to Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 17 that he had told ex-President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate in the election facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket, that Ukraine would either join NATO or develop nuclear weapons. Later the same day, he walked back that statement, saying that Ukraine was not planning to create a nuclear bomb as a deterrent against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion now in its third year. &quot;Zelensky mentioned nuclear weapons in order to call for further commitment by NATO countries, especially from the United States, for further support for Ukraine,&quot; Kazuto Suzuki, director of the Institute of Geoeconomics at the International House of Japan, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He might be thinking that Ukrainian resolve to possess nuclear weapons might give an additional reason for the new U.S. president, whoever is elected.&quot; Zelensky&#x2019;s talk about an atomic bomb comes just as fears mount that U.S. support for Ukraine could take a nosedive after the election amid Russia&#x2019;s accelerating offensive in the Donbas, especially with the prospect of Trump, who has criticized aid to Ukraine, back in the White House. Zelensky&apos;s comment on nuclear weapons was a reference to his Sept. 27 meeting with presidential candidate Trump during a visit to the U.S. Trump has praised Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and questioned further U.S. assistance to Ukraine. He has also promised to broker a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, and there is speculation that he could pressure Kyiv to cede territory to Russia or agree to Putin&apos;s terms. &quot;I told Donald Trump: either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which will serve as protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance. Apart from NATO, we do not know of such an effective alliance,&quot; Zelensky said in Brussels, where he presented his victory plan to EU leaders on Oct. 17. &quot;I believe Trump heard me and said that it was a fair argument,&#x201D; Zelensky added. Later the same day, Zelensky walked back his statement at a press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. &quot;We never spoke about&#x2026; preparing to create nuclear weapons or something like this,&quot; he said, adding that his comment referred to Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal in 1996 in exchange for the protection by three nuclear states, the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. The agreement is known as the Budapest Memorandum. Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in connection with the Republic of Belarus&apos;/Republic of Kazakhstan&apos;s/Ukraine&apos;s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

(Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, said that &quot;Trump might be more susceptible to the idea (of Ukraine having nuclear weapons)&#x201D; but &#x201C;it&apos;s a non-starter whoever wins&#x201D; in the U.S. election. &#x201C;I could certainly see (Trump) using the threat of allowing Ukraine to have nuclear weapons as part of whatever he thinks he will negotiate with Putin,&#x201D; he added. Some commentators argue that Zelensky&apos;s statement on nuclear weapons was just bluff and a tool of pressure. &quot;Clearly he was trying to get leverage with the U.S. and other NATO members for a stronger commitment to NATO membership for Ukraine, but regarding the U.S. election specifically he seems to be trying to position himself to have a decent relationship with whomever wins,&quot; Lynn Rusten, vice president at the U.S.-based Nuclear Threat Initiative&#x2019;s Global Nuclear Policy Program, told the Kyiv Independent. Claus Mathiesen, a lecturer at Denmark&apos;s Defense Academy and a former military attach&#xE9; in Ukraine, said that several countries are considering acquiring nuclear weapons amid uncertainty over post-election U.S. policy and the possibility of the U.S. reducing its commitment to NATO if Trump is elected. Meanwhile, Jenny Mathers, a lecturer in international politics at the U.K.&apos;s Aberystwyth University, believes that &#x201C;Zelensky&apos;s original statement may have been designed to shock Ukraine&apos;s Western supporters into realizing that Kyiv does need a more robust form of security guarantee than the &#x2018;as long as it takes&#x2019; that the West has been offering so far.&#x201D; She said that Zelensky&#x2019;s statement could &#x201C;jolt (the West) into changing their perception to regard offering NATO membership to Ukraine sooner rather than later as the less risky of the possible futures facing the world.&quot; President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and Republican presidential candidate former U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meet in New York during the President of Ukraine&apos;s visit to the United States in New York City, US on Sept. 27, 2024. (Uliana Boichuk/Novyny LIVE/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)According to Wolff, &quot;the debate indicates a certain level of desperation and resignation in Kyiv caused by the lack of Western follow-through on the tough, but often empty rhetoric frequently on display.&#x201D; An analyst and diplomat working for the U.S. government told the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky&apos;s statement had already had an impact on Ukraine&apos;s Western partners. He was speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Although Western allies don&apos;t see a Ukrainian nuclear program as realistic, the diplomat added, they understand Zelensky&apos;s message that the situation is desperate and that Ukraine needs security guarantees. &quot;Zelensky&apos;s message is clear,&quot; he said. &quot;The West actually gets this. Before September, an invitation to NATO had not been considered. But now the topic of inviting Ukraine to NATO is back on the table.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-used-talk-with-trump-about-nuclear-weapons-as-leverage-before-crucial-us-election-analysts-say/	2024-11-05T11:43:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1850792057.jpg
Russian military shoots 6 Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast, Prosecutor General's Office says	Russian troops shot dead six captured Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office reported on Nov. 5. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities. Russian forces captured on Oct. 23 three Ukrainian soldiers during an offensive on the town of Selydove and then shot them unarmed. A few days later, on Nov. 1, during an assault on Ukrainian lines in the Pokrovsk direction, Russian soldiers killed three more Ukrainian prisoners of war, shooting them, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said. The Prosecutor General&apos;s Office stressed that these actions violate the Geneva Conventions and qualify as an international crime. The Security Service of Ukraine is conducting a pre-trial investigation into the incident in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Then-Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin, on Oct. 15, called the killing of Ukrainian servicemen in captivity a &quot;deliberate policy&quot; of Russia. Ukrainian law enforcement agencies have information about the killing of at least 93 Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian soldiers, the head of the War Crimes Department in Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, Yurii Belousov, said on Oct. 4. Some 80% of the cases of executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war were recorded in 2024, but the trend began to appear in November 2023, when &quot;there were changes in the attitude of Russian military personnel towards our prisoners of war for the worse,&quot; Belousov said. Since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, both countries have frequently exchanged prisoners. The most recent swap occurred in mid-October, with each side bringin back 95 prisoners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-military-shoots-6-ukrainian-pows-in-donetsk-oblast-prosecutor-generals-office/	2024-11-05T11:35:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
Ukrainian electronic warfare could indirectly affect smartphone clock while repelling drone attacks, General Staff says	There may be disruptions in the operation of smartphone clocks due to electronic warfare (EW) used to repel Russian air attacks, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said on Nov. 5. Users in Ukraine have begun to experience more frequent automatic time changes on their smartphones due to the activation of electronic warfare systems during air raid alarms. Electronic warfare systems attempt to steer Russian drones in the wrong direction during the attack. This practice is called GPS spoofing or GPS simulation, and it involves manipulating or deceiving a GPS receiver by transmitting fake GPS signals. The receiver then obtains an incorrect location. Since modern smartphones also rely heavily on geolocation services to determine the time zone, this can lead to automatic clock switching when GPS spoofing is in effect. &quot;It is advisable to disable the automatic time update mode in the phone and take into account that the accuracy of satellite navigation systems may be disturbed during the announcement of air alerts,&quot; the General Staff said. Russia attacked Ukraine with over 900 bombs, almost 500 Shahed drones, and around 30 missiles over the week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the morning of Nov. 3. Zelensky also said that Russian forces launched over 2,000 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in October. Yet, Russia continues to avoid sanctions through the use of sanctions evasion networks and shell companies.

‘Trump wants to do everything he can to help Putin,’ McCain Institute head says	Evelyn Farkas, head of the McCain Institute &#x2014; a U.S.-based think tank named after the late Republican Senator John McCain &#x2014; fears the return of Donald Trump as president of the U.S. would be the worst-case scenario for Ukraine. The best-case scenario for Ukraine would be a full sweep by the Democratic party, with its candidate Vice President Kamala Harris taking the White House and its legislators gaining a majority in both houses of the U.S. Congress, she told the Kyiv Independent in a recent interview in Kyiv. Farkas is a prominent American national security advisor who has served in a variety of roles in prior U.S. administrations. In 2012, she was appointed deputy assistant defense secretary for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia under President Barack Obama. She served in this role when Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014 and annexed the Crimean Peninsula, later orchestrating a war in the far eastern Donbas region that preceded Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Farkas in the Ukrainian capital days before the Nov. 5 U.S. elections to discuss their potential outcomes for Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s legacy in the war, North Korea&#x2019;s involvement in the war, and the newly-formed &#x201C;axis of evil.&#x201D; This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: What&#x2019;s the best-case scenario for Ukraine in the U.S. election? Evelyn Farkas: I think the best-case scenario is Kamala Harris wins, we have a House and a Senate that are controlled by Democrats, and we are able to provide reliable assistance to Ukraine in a more than timely fashion. My hope is that she turns out to be like Harry Truman, a surprise kind of realist hawkish type president, which is possible as she&apos;s a prosecutor. She&apos;s said tough things, she said &#x2018;I know how to deal with people like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and (President of the People&apos;s Republic of China) Xi Jinping.&#x2019; There&apos;s a chance that she could end up being that person. The fact that she&apos;s taking Liz Cheney, (the elder daughter of former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and a Republican politician who opposes the party&#x2019;s presidential nominee Donald Trump) and others into her coalition gives me hope that those are people she&apos;s going to have to listen to and maybe she&apos;ll even put them in a position of responsibility. The best case scenario is also that we pay sufficient attention to Ukraine, not just with our financial resources and our weaponry but that we really figure out how can we help Ukraine achieve victory. But also in peacetime so that Ukraine becomes a stronger democracy.

(Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)We can&apos;t let the need for democratic progress impede our obligation to help Ukraine win. We have to balance all of these things, but simultaneously press forward on all fronts. On the war, I think we need to take some more risks ourselves. We used to have people in uniform in the country during the war (between 2014-2022 before the start of the full-scale invasion). When I was in the Pentagon, we had trainers at the Yavoriv (training base in western Ukraine). There&apos;s no reason why we can&apos;t send people here from NATO countries to help in the rear. We should because the Ukrainians don&apos;t have enough manpower and women power. Training, logistics, and all things in the rear &#x2014; those are all things we should be helping the Ukrainians with. And then, of course, weaponry. The problem for the U.S. is that we also have a big debt and deficit and so there will be pressure on the overall spending but there will also be a lot of pressure to spend more in the defense realm in general to deter China and to help other allies like Israel. I don&apos;t really see any way out of spending on defense, whether it&apos;s directly for the U.S.&#x2019;s defense or indirectly to help allies and partners who help provide a shield against all the bad guys. And that&apos;s just the best-case scenario, Harris. The Kyiv Independent: There is a narrative among some that President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration has been supportive of Ukraine, but they haven&apos;t done enough. They&apos;ve been too cautious, too afraid of escalation. Would you say that has been an adequate handling of this crisis? Evelyn Farkas: No! Going back to when I was in the Obama Administration, there were budget constraints. We were told how much money we had, and within that amount of money, we had to provide assistance for Ukraine. Ukraine came in with its list, that (at the time) included F-16s. (Former Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko wanted those too. And we couldn&apos;t do those things because we had a budget. That was in the early days. We didn&apos;t know how it was going to unfold. By the time the Biden Administration came in, it was clear what was going on even without the full frontal invasion. In fact, the question was, what was Putin going to do next? Because it wasn&apos;t working, because the war, as he had designed it, had not achieved the objective that he thought it would. So, therefore the full frontal invasion became for him &#x201C;a necessity.&#x201D; So I think anyone could have recognized that he wasn&apos;t going to keep it frozen forever if he wanted to achieve dominance over Ukraine. I think the Biden Administration should have given more to Ukraine earlier, and certainly when we saw the troops massing in April of 2021. I mean it&#x2019;s ridiculous. From that moment on we should have either quietly &#x2014; it&apos;s hard for us to do anything quietly because we do have to get Congressional approval &#x2014; but still, we could have done a lot more to beef up their defenses and maybe that would have deterred Russia. I&apos;ve advocated for all kinds of things &#x2013; a no-fly zone, F-16s &#x2013; we could have done any of those things at various points in time. We never took the initiative. We were always reactive rather than proactive and that&apos;s through all the administrations. The Kyiv Independent: Where do you think that comes from with these administrations? Evelyn Farkas: I think once they&apos;re in the White House, they start thinking about the worst-case scenario and that they could be responsible. That&apos;s when the nuclear topic comes up. President Obama just didn&apos;t want to be responsible for a nuclear war. He just couldn&apos;t rule it out. (At the time) we explained why providing Javelins wouldn&apos;t be escalatory, but it wasn&apos;t convincing to (Obama) and then it popped up again with Biden. I don&apos;t know what intelligence they have that I didn&#x2019;t. Certainly, during the Obama Administration, I didn&apos;t have any intelligence that &#x2014; and I had access to very sensitive intelligence &#x2014; indicated that Putin was going to use nuclear weapons in any scenario, not that I can recall. Russian President Vladimir Putin looks on during his meeting with participants of the Russia International Exhibition-Forum while visiting the All-Russian Exhibition Center in Moscow, Russia, on July 8, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)We know that his nuclear doctrine says that if the existence of the (Russian) state is in danger, then Putin can use nuclear weapons. I guess you could draw a line from that to comments from Putin saying that it&apos;s &#x201C;existential&#x201D; for Russia that they keep Crimea, for example. So then under the Biden administration, I can&apos;t rule out that there wasn&apos;t some reason why. There have been hints that there was some (reason). They&#x2019;re always looking for what&#x2019;s happening at nuclear facilities, to see if anything is moving, and possibly, they got alarmed at one point. The Kyiv Independent: Are there people in Washington who have the appetite for something like sending trainers or helping with logistics, especially with a Harris administration? Evelyn Farkas: I think so &#x2014; &#xA0;I think we should take the risk and that there would be an appetite for it if you had a president leading and making the case. I also think we shouldn&apos;t be afraid of doing something like establishing a no-fly zone for Ukraine, helping maybe open an airport in Lviv, for example, with our capabilities. Because, number one, we&apos;ve done it with Israel. Yes, Iran&apos;s not a nuclear power, but they&apos;re close and North Korea is now involved. And, you better bet your bottom dollar they&apos;re a nuclear country. One of our Ukrainian interlocutors said: &#x2018;The Russians know what they want and they have partners who will deliver what they want. We know what we want but we don&apos;t have partners that will deliver what we want.&#x2019; The Kyiv Independent: About North Korea. To the whole world, this seems like an extremely escalatory move. And it does seem like the U.S., the Biden Administration rather, is reacting with remarkable caution. Evelyn Farkas: It&apos;s ridiculous. It&apos;s terrible. It&apos;s outrageous. They&apos;re probably having a muted reaction because they&apos;re making the mistake of looking at what it means militarily. Yes, militarily, I don&apos;t think the North Koreans are going to win the war for Russia. In fact, it&apos;s probably going to blow back in the faces of the Russians and the North Koreans. Already, there&apos;s been some reporting by CNN in particular that the North Korean rumor mill is out. I&apos;m sure South Korea has used all its means to get the word out to North Korea that their sons are being sent to Russia, not to do an exercise, which is what they told the troops. It won&#x2019;t change anything militarily, but diplomatically and in terms of the signals it sends that we don&apos;t respond, it&apos;s horrible because it really is an expansion. It really is as if we&apos;re one more step into World War III. The new leader of Hezbollah said we&apos;re in a global war. He spelled it out. We are the only ones who are like, &#x2018;No, no, we&apos;re not in a global war,&#x2019; which is insane. And when I say, &apos;we,&apos; it&#x2019;s not just us Americans, but the Europeans as well. People, pull yourselves together. The Kyiv Independent: There&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s now being called this &#x201C;axis of evil&#x201D; including North Korea, Russia, Iran, and China. As this group forms, is the West not taking it seriously? Evelyn Farkas: I think the U.S. is taking it seriously. We know that we are the strongest economic military-political power in the world, and with our allies and partners in Europe and Asia and then the Middle East, we can prevail. But that doesn&apos;t mean we should be relaxed because these guys have all kinds of asymmetric means and they can make various moves where they can prevail in the short run to seek an advantage. We can always come roaring back. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s changed. It&apos;s just like World War I and World War II. If they probe, if Putin decides the sabotage operations indicate that we&apos;re weak, that NATO is a paper tiger, and then decides to make an incursion into (NATO member) Estonia, and we do nothing, we don&apos;t invoke Article 5, he will think then that he&apos;s won. We can&#x2019;t allow that to happen. Eventually, we&apos;ll be at war with Russia. I don&apos;t see any other way because he&apos;s not going to stop. We&apos;re gonna have to stop him. The Kyiv Independent: So looking at Trump, do you think that he and his team understand these risks that you just laid out? Evelyn Farkas: First, you have to answer the question of who his team is. If it&apos;s Robert O&apos;Brien, who was his national security adviser, does he understand how the world works and what the threats are? Robert O&apos;Brien is still in the circle. And so is Mike Pompeo, former U.S. secretary of state (in Trump&#x2019;s first presidency). He understands the risk. He did some, I think, reckless things diplomatically by negotiating with the Taliban and getting nothing in return, but he does know what he&apos;s doing. There will be some other people like that in the administration with real national security experience, who know what&apos;s going on and can see the stakes.

(Kamil Krzaczynski / AFP via Getty Images)There are some other people in that category, like Elbridge Colby who is senior in the Trump ranks, who say that China is the real risk and we should ignore Russia. It&apos;s ridiculous. Russia is China&apos;s pawn. Russia is being used by China, from the Chinese perspective, to weaken us. China loves this. And once they see Putin getting his way, they&#x2019;ll see we&#x2019;re distracted, and they&#x2019;ll turn to take Taiwan. We don&apos;t know what Xi Jingping&#x2019;s time frame is, but we can&apos;t be complacent about that either. The Kyiv Independent: So it does depend on Trump&apos;s team but would you say then that his rhetoric around the elections is populist? Or do you think he and (his vice presidential nominee) J.D. Vance, particularly reflect these views? Evelyn Farkas: Who knows what their views are. Trump&apos;s view is he wants to do everything he can to help Putin because for whatever reason he likes these strongmen. He&apos;s fascinated by him in particular. And so it will take all the will and the fighting of the people under him to maintain the existing policy of support for Ukraine and opposition to Russia&apos;s autocratic agenda. J.D. Vance is empty. He just goes with the flow, and who knows? If Trump passes from the scene, he could suddenly become interested in helping Ukraine. He&#x2019;s a cipher because he lacks principles, from my perspective. The Kyiv Independent: Is there concern that Trump feels that he learned his lesson from his first term, when he had people around him who acted as guard rails, constantly blocking things, and that he may be thinking, &#x2018;not this time. I&apos;m going to put people in who are going to do the extreme stuff.&#x2019; That&apos;s the fear. Would you say that&apos;s a fair assessment? Evelyn Farkas: Absolutely. He&apos;s gonna pick all the yes men. Kash Patel, for example, is a guy who also seems to have no principles, only wants power and has a sense of grievance like Trump, so he&apos;s willing to do whatever it takes to make Trump happy. The Kyiv Independent: And how do you think that will affect foreign policy with respect to Ukraine? Evelyn Farkas: They&apos;ll do whatever Trump says. Trump says, let&apos;s get out of NATO. They&apos;ll try. The Senate did pass a piece of legislation in the aftermath of Trump&apos;s last attempt saying that the Senate has to ratify withdrawal. But he doesn&apos;t care about the rule of law. Congress might say, well you have to keep spending money on NATO, but he won&#x2019;t care. He could cause a whole constitutional crisis/meltdown. The Kyiv Independent: What can the Biden administration do in these last months to support Ukraine and what do you expect from the next Ramstein format meetings of allies on providing weaponry to Ukraine? Evelyn Farkas: There&apos;s an understanding that Ukraine has a small window, regardless of whoever wins, but certainly if Trump were to win. So in the worst-case scenario (Trump winning), Biden is going to want to cement his legacy and he&apos;s going to want to help Zelensky as much as possible in the last days of his term. But even if Harris comes in, I think he will be motivated to cement his legacy. I understand they are talking about what they can do to respond to (Zelensky&#x2019;s) &#x2018;victory plan.&#x2019; I think they are looking at NATO invitation and the modalities of that. I would want him to number one, remove the restrictions (on Ukraine using Western-provided long-range missiles for deep strikes into Russia). I would be shocked if they didn&apos;t tell the U.K. that Ukraine could use its Storm Shadows. But I think that we also should &#x2014; and there&apos;s a decent chance that we also will, a more than 50% chance &#x2014; lift the restrictions on the long-range capabilities. They&apos;re holding back right now. They have a specific fear right now, that&apos;s not fear of Putin&apos;s escalation necessarily, but the fear of something going awry and negatively impacting (Harris&#x2019;) election. And where are the Patriot (missile systems) they committed in May? They need to accelerate the provision of assistance, they need to bring trainers and put them here in Kyiv. They need to put people in to help with logistics. They need to consider providing some air support to protect civilians. We can just say, &#x2018;We&apos;re not getting involved in the war. We&apos;re protecting civilians. We&apos;re protecting the airport.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s also important to push toward the resolution of the conflict, push to return things to normal. Clearly, the administration also has to have a conversation with the Ukrainians. We&apos;re thinking maybe about a unity government because it&apos;s still impossible to hold elections. One, because the (Ukrainian) Constitution prohibits it, but also because it would be so expensive, like, five billion dollars, so hard to do credibly, and would leave some people disenfranchised. And also the money. It&#x2019;s really important to unfreeze that money (a $50 billion loan from profits of frozen Russian assets abroad) so that Ukraine has funds. And if Ukraine puts in place reforms, if they address the structural problems that lead to corruption, it will be a wealthy country.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wants-to-do-everything-he-can-to-help-putin-mccain-institute-head-says/	2024-11-05T08:57:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182348734.jpg
North Korean military involvement in Russia's war to be met with 'coordinated response,' G7 foreign ministers say	Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) and three key allies have expressed &quot;grave concerns&quot; over North Korea&apos;s military deployment in Russia and are working on a &quot;coordinated response,&quot; according to the joint statement published on Nov. 5. Besides the G7 members, including the U.S., Japan, Italy, the U.K., Germany, France, Canada, and the High Representative of the European Union, the statement was also signed by South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. &quot;Several thousands of DPRK troops have been deployed to Russia. The DPRK&apos;s direct support for Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine, besides showing Russia&apos;s desperate efforts to compensate its losses, would mark a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific peace and security,&quot; the statement read. &quot;It would be a further breach of international law, including the most fundamental principles of the U.N. Charter.&quot; The ministers condemned in &quot;the strongest possible terms&quot; the deepening of the military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, including Russia&apos;s &quot;unlawful procurement&quot; of North Korean ballistic missiles. The ministers also expressed concern over potential transfers of nuclear or ballistic missile-related technology from Russia to the DPRK. &quot;We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to support Ukraine as it defends its freedom, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. We are working with our international partners for a coordinated response to this new development,&quot; the statement read. North Korea has deployed 11,000 troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 4. On the following day, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed that the first clashes between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and North Korean soldiers had already taken place in Kursk Oblast. According to Zelensky, Russia has confirmed to the West the involvement of Pyongyang&apos;s forces in the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministers-of-g7-allied-countries-prepare-coordinated-response-to-dprk-military-involvement-in-russias-war/	2024-11-05T08:27:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Russia strikes near residential area in Kharkiv, injuring at least 2	Russia carried out a drone attack on Kharkiv on Nov. 5, targeting the site close to a residential area, local authorities reported. Two women, aged 56 and 72, were injured and received medical treatment at the scene, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. The attack, carried out at around 5 p.m. &#xA0;damaged a five-story apartment building. Its windows on the second, third, and fourth floors were smashed. Cars near the building were also damaged, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. The emergency services are continuing to work at the scene. Located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border, the northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless Russian attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. In recent months, Moscow has intensified aerial strikes, often targeting densely populated neighborhoods. A Russian attack on Oct. 28 damaged the Derzhprom building (the State Industry Building), a historic landmark that has been under enhanced UNESCO protection since 2022. On Nov. 3, Russia attacked another residential neighborhood in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kharkiv, injuring at least 15 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-near-residential-area-in-kharkiv-injuring-at-least-1/	2024-11-05T08:19:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2114357693.jpg
Umerov confirms first battles between Ukrainian and North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast	The first clashes between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and North Korean soldiers have already taken place in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed on Nov. 5 in an interview with South Korean TV channel KBS. North Korea deployed 11,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the day before, citing Ukraine&apos;s intelligence report. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, also claimed on Nov. 4 that the first North Korean soldiers stationed in this area have come under fire. &quot;We are identifying clashes with North Korean forces, but we believe there will be more fighting in the next few weeks, and we will continue to analyze and revise accordingly,&quot; Umerov said. The clashes were small-scale, according to Umerov. The minister added that the DPRK soldiers were &quot;disguised as Buryats&quot; (an Asian people group inside Russia&apos;s borders) and mixed with Russian soldiers, so all the identities need to be checked to confirm the exact number of their losses and prisoners. Kyiv expects five units of 3,000 people each to be deployed along the 1,500-kilometer front line. This will bring the total number of North Koreans involved in the war to 15,000. The Russian border region has seen heavy battles since Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive in early August. Moscow has deployed North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast to reinforce lines there while its most experienced units continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are gathering. According to Zelensky, Russia has confirmed to the West the involvement of Pyongyang&apos;s forces in the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-forces-have-clashed-with-north-korean-soldiers-in-russias-kursk-oblast-umerov-says/	2024-11-05T06:59:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168760161.jpg
Russia stepping up election interference as US citizens head to polls, intelligence agencies warn	Russia is expected to intensify attempts to undermine the U.S. vote on election day with a focus on swing states, U.S. intelligence agencies said in a statement on the eve of the election on Nov. 4. U.S. citizens are heading to the polls on Nov. 5 as the country chooses between Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris and her Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump. &quot;Since our statement on Friday, the IC (Intelligence Community) has been observing foreign adversaries, particularly Russia, conducting additional influence operations intended to undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stoke divisions among Americans,&quot; a statement by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), &#xA0;the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the FBI read. &quot;The IC expects these activities will intensify through election day and in the coming weeks, and that foreign influence narratives will focus on swing states.&quot; U.S. intelligence has previously warned that Russia seeks to undermine the Democratic ticket by spreading disinformation online and other malicious methods. In the most recent statement, the agencies said that &quot;Russian influence actors&quot; recently amplified an article falsely accusing U.S. officials of planning an electoral fraud across swing states. Pro-Russian actors have also reportedly posted a video falsely depicting a plot involving fake overseas ballots and changing voter rolls to favor Harris. In a separate example reported the same day, a pro-Trump online influencer that goes by the handle @AlphaFox78 on X told CNN he was paid $100 by a pro-Russian propagandist to post fake videos of Haitian immigrants voting in the election. The Georgia Secretary of State said the content of the videos was entirely fake. U.S. intelligence also accused Iran of &quot;malicious cyber activities&quot; aimed at undermining Trump&apos;s campaign. The election result can have a profound impact on the Russia-Ukraine war. While Harris pledged to continue supporting Ukraine in its struggle, there are fears that Trump would seek to cut a deal with Moscow, even at the cost of painful concessions on Ukraine&apos;s side.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-ramping-up-election-interefence-as-us-citizens-head-to-polls-intelligence-agencies-warn/	2024-11-05T05:53:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181846900.jpg
London unable to retrieve UK-licensed arms used to protect Russian oil tankers, Bloomberg reports	The United Kingdom has been unable to retrieve its weapons from floating armories offering &#xA0;weapons and accommodation for guards defending Russian oil tankers, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 5. As Russia&#x2019;s oil exports increased to India following EU sanctions, so did the number of its vessels traveling through the dangerous Suez Canal and Red Sea, driving up demand for armed guards who temporarily travel on the ships until they pass the dangerous zone. The guards use the floating armories for weapons storage and accommodation, Bloomberg explains. As sanctions ramped up, the U.K. withdrew the permits for these vessels, but the weapons stored on them were not returned to a licensed depot, the outlet writes. The vessels serving as armories were transferred to a Singapore-based company, remaining in use by the security firms providing their services, using British weapons to protect sanctioned Russian oil exports from pirates. Since the change of domicile by the companies owning the vessels, the U.K. has been unable to determine where the weapons are and been unable to retrieve them, Bloomberg reported, citing an undisclosed source familiar with the matter. Fossil fuel exports are one of the key sources of revenue for Russia&apos;s federal budget, helping to sustain Moscow&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. While the Western countries have imposed massive sanctions against the Russian economy since the outbreak of the all-out war in 2022, Moscow has managed to avoid many restrictions through intermediaries and shell companies. Russia is also aided in sanctions evasion through its allies, including China, Iran, and North Korea.	https://kyivindependent.com/bloomberg-uk-licensed-arms-russian-tankers/	2024-11-05T05:35:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1208082264.jpg
Russia doesn't recognize Moldovan President Sandu's re-election, Kremlin spokesperson says	Russia does not recognize incumbent Moldavan President Maia Sandu&#x2019;s recent election victory, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the pro-state Kommersant news outlet on Nov. 5. &quot;She is not, as far as we understand, the president of her country because, in the country itself, the majority of the population did not vote for her,&quot; Peskov said. Pro-EU Sandu won on Nov. 3 by a margin of about 55.3% to 44.7% despite what she called an &quot;unprecedented&quot; election interference backed by Moscow. The Russian-friendly Party of Socialists, who supported Sandu&apos;s opponent Alexandr Stoianoglo, also announced on Nov. 5 that they do not view Sandu as legitimately elected and will not recognize her as president. Igor Dodon, Sandu&apos;s Kremlin-backed predecessor and the Socialist chairman, accused the president of &quot;brazen manipulations&quot; and said that she was elected only thanks to diaspora votes. The party plans an appeal to the Constitutional Court and the Central Election Committee regarding alleged &quot;violations by authorities.&quot; The election saw a record turnout among the Moldovan diaspora. Some 327,000 votes were cast from abroad, of which over 80% were for Sandu. At home, the incumbent president received 48.67% of the vote, compared to 51.3% won by former Prosecutor General Stoianoglo. The country of 2.5 million saw a 54% turnout. Moldovan authorities, independent observers, and officials from the EU and the U.S. pointed to a malign influence campaign involving criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Moldovan lawmakers claimed that Moscow spent millions of dollars backing Stoianoglo.

EU's anti-fraud arm investigating possible rebranding of Russian oil to avoid sanctions, Politico reports	The European Union&#x2019;s anti-fraud agency opened an investigation into the possible exporting of rebranded Russian oil via Turkey into the EU, Politico reported on Nov. 5, citing two undisclosed sources. OLAF, an investigative body of the European Union, can recommend member states to take action or launch criminal investigations as a result of its own probings. It is very likely that Turkish ports have been accepting and then sending rebranded Russian oil to the EU using a loophole in the sanctions, an earlier investigation by Politico showed. Turkey has been long singled out as one of the main facilitators of circumventing sanctions imposed on Russia by the West over the invasion of Ukraine. The European Union introduced a ban on importing Russian oil at the end of 2022 in its attempt to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, granting temporary exceptions only for landlocked countries such as Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Politico&#x2019;s evidence includes matching spikes in Russian import and oil export in Turkish ports and analysts pointing out that Turkey simply rebrands the Russian oil it re-exports to the EU, giving the cargo a paper that testifies to its &quot;non-sanctioned&quot; origin. According to Politico, this loophole generated up to 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in income for Moscow&#x2019;s war chest in 2023 alone. Turkey, a member of NATO, has been pursuing a standalone Russia policy since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began, retaining a mediator role between Russia, Ukraine, and the West. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has publicly supported Ukrainian sovereignty. Turkey has provided arms to Ukraine and, together with the U.N., brokered the now-defunct Black Sea grain corridor agreement.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-investigates-rebranding-of-russian-oil/	2024-11-05T03:58:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1477537303.jpg
Opinion: Ukraine needs to rethink its long-range strike strategy	In 2022, Russia launched long-range strikes deep into Ukraine, confident that Ukraine could not retaliate in kind. By 2023, that situation changed. Ukraine received medium-range HIMARS rockets from the U.S., Storm Shadow and SCALP cruise missiles from the U.K. and France, and developed long-range attack drones of its own. These rockets, missiles, and drones, used in shrewd combinations, have allowed Ukraine to strike Russian railways, roads, munitions stockpiles, maintenance facilities, storage warehouses, and fuel depots. As a result, Russia is finding it much harder to sustain and support its front-line forces. Even so, Russia retains some real advantages. The country&#x2019;s vast size has allowed it to move logistics support further to the rear, making resupply to the front line slower but still feasible. This geographic advantage means Russian weapon factories, major arms stockpiles, fuel refineries, and air bases are largely protected from regular attacks. Additionally, Russia receives dual-use supplies from China and other foreign supporters. These materials, valuable to both civilians and the military, have been less affected by sanctions. Russian logistical losses can often be offset by external sources. Lastly, Russia&#x2019;s industrial capacity allows it to repair much of the damage from Ukraine&#x2019;s limited air strikes. While these repairs may be crude, they are often effective. Repairing industrial infrastructure does divert resources away from civilian needs, affecting the Russian populace. However, this burden hasn&#x2019;t yet led to significant public opposition to the war. Operationally, Ukraine&#x2019;s current air campaign is focused on oil and petroleum supplies, munitions storage, and air bases used by strike aircraft and bombers. These strikes aim to deny Russia ultimate victory, but so far, Ukraine&#x2019;s attacks have been too infrequent to achieve this goal. Strategically, Russia appears intent on continuing the war regardless of the costs in blood and treasure. Given this, an alternative strategy would be to redirect Ukraine&#x2019;s air campaign toward punishment. In Russian military terms, this would involve a &quot;Strategic Operation for the Destruction of Critical Infrastructure&quot; &#x2014; designed to pressure the population into ending the fight by making daily life unbearable. Footage purporting to show an oil terminal on fire in Smolensk Oblast, Russia, on April 24, 2024. (Open sources/X).A photo purporting to show a fire at an oil depot in Tambov Oblast, Russia, after an alleged drone attack on June 20, 2024. (Open sources/Telegram).Such attacks, however, are reminiscent of outdated air power theories from the 1920s, have questionable effectiveness, and can violate the laws of war, as seen in Russia&#x2019;s attacks on hospitals in Syria and Ukraine. More modern thinking favors targeting the leadership of a society rather than its people. This approach, though somewhat messily, worked in the 1999 Kosovo War. It is increasingly important now, as denying Russia victory outright seems unlikely. Instead, Russian leaders must be convinced it is in their best interest to end the war. Ukraine&#x2019;s new 700-km-range Hrim-2 ballistic missile and 400-km-range Neptune-derived cruise missile are entering service, both with warheads far more powerful than Ukraine&#x2019;s current drones. These missiles, combined with an increasing number of long-range drones, will allow more frequent and damaging strikes. However, Ukraine must continue to prioritize targets that offer the most strategic impact. The current approach of targeting supply chains could be enhanced by taking a systems approach and choosing which level of war the attacks might be best focused at. At the operational level, Ukraine could concentrate on disrupting the resupply of Russian front-line forces, particularly when they are under pressure, such as during a Ukrainian offensive. At the strategic level, Ukraine might aim to shorten the war by targeting critical manufacturing hubs that support Russia&#x2019;s military, keeping in mind that these could be repaired or replaced. At the grand strategic level, the goal would be to cripple Russia&#x2019;s national economy by damaging key industries that are difficult to replace. This strategy could carry over into the post-war period, diminishing Russia&#x2019;s power. Alternatively, these new weapons could prompt a deeper rethinking of Ukraine&#x2019;s air campaign. NATO&#x2019;s success in Kosovo provides a model, as its airstrikes targeted dual-use infrastructure, creating widespread inconvenience, undermining morale, and persistently wearing down the population. Simultaneous strikes against the ruling elite&#x2019;s property weakened their &#x201C;will to war.&#x201D; Together, these efforts achieved a strategically significant result. A similar campaign against Russia would be difficult to execute and would likely require support from offensive cyber operations, diplomatic pressure, and tightened sanctions. Nonetheless, the possibility of helping to end the war is enticing. Ultimately, Ukraine faces a choice: either enhance its air campaign to deny Russia victory or shift to a strategy of punishment to compel Russia to end the war. Neither option will be easy.

Ukrainian Legion in Poland reportedly receives over 500 applications in a month	The recruitment center of the Ukrainian Legion in Poland has received over 500 applications in a month from Ukrainians living in 30 countries, Ukrinform reported on Nov. 5, citing the center&apos;s officials. The legion was unveiled in July as a volunteer military unit made up of Ukrainian men living in Poland and trained by the Polish Armed Forces. The first volunteer recruitment center was opened in October at the Ukrainian consulate in the eastern Polish city of Lublin. The unit is part of an effort to replenish the ranks of Ukraine&apos;s military as the all-out war with Russia goes on for over two and half years. Most applications came from Poland and Czechia, but Ukrainians living in the U.K., Ireland, the U.S., and Canada also submitted requests, Ukrinform wrote. While the center&apos;s officials believe that not all applicants will end up signing a contract, they deem the turnout to be a good first result. The legion will allow Ukrainians to join the fight while being able to return to Poland after completing their service. Under martial law instituted in 2022 after the start of the full-scale war, Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are not permitted to leave Ukraine without permission. The U.N. estimates that 6.7 million Ukrainians were driven abroad as a result of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. This is in addition to a sizeable diaspora living in Europe, the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere since before 2022. The first volunteers are expected to sign a contract before the end of the year and begin training in Polish training grounds. Around 90% of the applicants were men, and roughly 80% had no previous military experience, Ukrinform reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-legion-500/	2024-11-05T03:18:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/8f98b1a7b04779a144640363f279fdba2fe1e982.jpeg
Estonia wants to bar Russian, Belarusian citizens from voting in local elections	Estonia seeks to narrow voting eligibility in local elections to exclude Russian and Belarusian citizens in order to counter Russian influence, Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal told state broadcaster ERR on Nov. 4. &quot;Today, we agreed within the coalition council that we recommend changing the constitution as soon as possible so that citizens of aggressor countries are no longer the decision-makers in local elections,&quot; Michal told ERR. The Baltic country, with a population of 1.3 million, has an ethnic Russian minority of around 296,000, of which an estimated 80,000 hold Russian citizenship. Estonia is also home to 3,000 Belarusian citizens. Estonia is heading toward local elections in October 2025, with residents with foreign citizenship permitted to participate. The proposed changes would limit this right to citizens of NATO, EU, and several other countries, with Russia and Belarus excluded. The amendment has to pass the parliament with the support of a constitutional majority, receive a presidential signature, and likely get approval from a court as legal challenges are expected to take place. Estonia has been among Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, providing humanitarian, developmental, and military assistance. Between 2022 and 2024, Estonia has devoted around 520 million euros ($575 million) in support to Ukraine. This represents 1.4% of the country&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP), one of the highest percentages of all Kyiv&apos;s partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-wants-to-bar-russian-belarusian-citizens-from-voting-in-local-elections/	2024-11-05T02:37:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-464882654.jpg
Georgian court annuls election results at 30 precincts over secrecy violations	A district court in the country of Georgia nullified the election results in 30 precincts over voting secrecy violations, RFE/RL&apos;s Georgian service reported on Nov. 4 amid widespread allegations of a rigged vote. The news comes as Georgia&apos;s pro-EU opposition refuses to recognize the claimed victory of the ruling Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party, which sparked large-scale protests in Tbilisi. The Tetri Tskaro district court ruled that the voting method used in dozens of stations in the southern towns of Tetri Tskaro and Tsalka violated the secrecy of the vote. The voters had to mark the ballots with a marker in such a way that during a subsequent ballot counting by a machine, their choice was visible. The presiding judge also pointed out that the district election commission did not address the complaint appropriately, indicating some level of manipulation or interference. While this represents only a small number of polling stations across the country, the authors of the complaint &#x2013; Georgian Young Lawyers&apos; Association &#x2013; said the ruling sets a precedent for better protection of voting secrecy rights. &quot;We welcome this decision, emphasizing its importance for a fair and democratic electoral process,&quot; the group said. The Central Election Commission can appeal the ruling. While official results said that Georgian Dream won almost 54% of the vote, opposition leaders and international observers pointed to a large number of cases of suspected intimidation, ballot stuffing, and vote buying. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said on Oct. 27 that the Georgian parliament will approve the government despite the opposition&apos;s protests, while the opposition called on international leaders not to recognize the results. Georgian Dream has been accused of democratic backsliding and of leading the South Caucasus country back into the Kremlin&apos;s orbit. The adoption of the controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law earlier this year also led to widespread protests and subsequent violent crackdowns by the police. Shortly after the election results were announced, the European Commission said that the process of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union had been suspended, underscoring the growing chasm between Tbilisi and the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-court-annuls-election-results-at-30-polling-stations/	2024-11-05T01:45:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180895523.jpg
Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia kills 6, injures 9	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian attack against the city of Zaporizhzhia on Nov. 5 killed at least six people and injured at least nine, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Russian forces reportedly targeted an infrastructure facility, starting a fire. The full extent of damage is being determined. Authorities warned about a possible ballistic missile strike at around 9:10 a.m. local time, after which several explosions were reported in the city. Zaporizhzhia, the regional center of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, is a common target of Russian attacks. Some 710,000 residents lived in the city before the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia/	2024-11-05T01:17:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1768061719.jpeg
Russian attacks across Ukraine injure 3 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine wounded three people over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 5. Russia launched 79 Shahed-type drones and other drones overnight, as well as guided bombs and two Kh-59/69 aerial missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 48 drones over eight regions while 30 drones were &quot;lost,&quot; and one flew back to Russia, the Air Force said. Both Kh-59/69 missiles launched by Russia were reportedly shot down on approach to Odesa Oblast. The Russian military attacked Kharkiv&apos;s Shevchenkivskyi district overnight with guided bombs, injuring two women aged 39 and 40. In another attack on Kharkiv, a house was damaged, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russian strikes damaged four houses, a gas pipeline, and a garage, injuring one person, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, 13 houses were damaged across 11 villages as a result of the attacks, regional authorities reported. The Russian military attacked the Kutsurub community in Mykolaiv Oblast four times with first-person view (FPV) drones, Governor Vitalii Kim reported on his Telegram channel. No casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine/	2024-11-05T00:41:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Syniehubov-Nov-5.jpg
Opinion: Handshaking Putin and hugging Lukashenko, UN head Guterres undermines the ICC	While the president of the International Criminal Court (ICC) recently expressed &#x201C;high appreciation&#x201D; for the United Nations&#x2019; cooperative relations during the commemoration of UN Day, a troubling incident unfolded 3,000 kilometers away from The Hague in Kazan, Russia. UN Secretary-General Ant&#xF3;nio Guterres, smiling and bowing his head, shook hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the very person the ICC seeks to arrest. This meeting raises significant moral concerns, epitomizing a blatant disregard for the Ukrainian children who have been forcibly deported amid Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine &#x2014; charges for which Putin is wanted by the ICC. Beyond the emotional implications, this encounter undermines the principles that the UN itself should uphold. As I argued on EJIL: Talk!, the European Journal of International Law&#x2019;s blog, in 2013, the UN adopted guidance to regulate meetings between UN Secretariat staff and individuals subject to arrest warrants issued by the ICC. According to these guidelines, there should generally be no meetings between UN officials and persons subject to ICC arrest warrants. In a joint statement, Truth Hounds and several other Ukrainian NGOs extensively analyzed this legal framework and demonstrated a lack of justification for such a meeting. Moreover, UN principles unequivocally establish that there should be no &#x201C;ceremonial meetings&#x201D; with or &#x201C;standard courtesy calls&#x201D; to individuals subject to ICC arrest warrants. The same holds true for receptions, photo opportunities, and attendance at national day celebrations. The photo from Guterres and Putin&#x2019;s meeting speaks for itself. A 2004 agreement between the UN and the ICC also requires the UN to refrain from any actions that could impede the ICC&#x2019;s and the prosecutor&#x2019;s activities or undermine the authority of their decisions. How can we expect, in the words of the ICC&#x2019;s president, to work toward &#x201C;strengthening the rule of law at the international level and bringing accountability and justice for all,&#x201D; if representatives of international organizations disregard these written rules? Guterres&#x2019; personal meeting with Putin does not strengthen the rule of law or bring accountability and justice. Instead, it undermines public perception of the ICC&#x2019;s authority and suggests a normalization of contacts with potential war criminals at the international level. As professor of international law Sergey Vasiliev noted, &#x201C;What grand humanitarian strategy may have guided the UNSG to shake the hand of Putin and bro-hug (Belarusian dictator Alexander) Lukashenka?&#x201D; On Oct. 24, the ICC found that Mongolia failed to cooperate in the arrest and surrender of Putin when he visited the country&#x2019;s capital in September. Guterres&#x2019; reckless actions clearly do not foster a more serious attitude among states regarding ICC arrest warrants. Will ICC authorities comment on Guterres&#x2019; actions? Time will tell. The disregard or negligent attitude of UN officials toward the principles of the UN and international law appears not to be an isolated incident. In May 2023, the UN Secretary-General&#x2019;s Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba, traveled to Moscow to meet another ICC suspect for war crimes against children &#x2014; Russian Commissioner for Children&#x2019;s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova. Gamba issued only a general statement, claiming that &#x201C;any guidance provided by the UN has been properly followed in the case of this visit.&#x201D; Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) meets with Russian Children&apos;s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova outside Moscow, Russia, on Feb. 16, 2023. (Mikhail Metzel/SPUTNIK/AFP via Getty Images)As Ryan Goodman, a founding co-editor of the international law blog Just Security, noted, the meeting faced extensive criticism from human rights groups (including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International) and scholars of international criminal law and humanitarian law. Despite this backlash, the ICC&#x2019;s annual report on its activities for 2022-2023, submitted to the UN General Assembly (UNGA), did not even mention the Gamba-Lvova-Belova meeting. The 2023 annual report from the Secretary-General on the UN-ICC relationship did not address the meeting or justify its necessity. The only relevant information noted was that the UN continued to refrain from actions that might undermine the Court&apos;s activities or the authority of its decisions. The problematic aspect is not limited to the meetings themselves, which the guidance allows in extreme circumstances; it extends to the apparent lack of accountability in justifying these visits. To the public, it seems the UN treats such meetings casually and carelessly. Instead of fostering open discussion and providing proper justification, UN representatives hide behind general remarks about compliance. Without a proper response, those involved will feel free to engage in further meetings with ICC suspects without adequate explanation. It is high time for all stakeholders to swiftly react to the Guterres-Putin incident. First, it is essential to establish whether the UN Office of Legal Affairs, as per the 2016 Best Practices Manual for United Nations-International Criminal Court Cooperation, informed the ICC&#x2019;s prosecutor and the president of the Assembly of States Parties about the Guterres-Putin meeting in advance. This letter should substantiate why the meeting was deemed necessary and should be made public to allow society to understand the rationale behind it. Second, Guterres, as Secretary-General, must explain the reasoning for his meeting with Putin, and a detailed public statement should follow, along with a confidential briefing to the Office of the Prosecutor General. Third, in such instances, the president of the ICC&#x2019;s Assembly of States Parties should engage with Guterres to seek explanations. The Assembly should also invoke UN-ICC Article 15(2) to request an explanation from Guterres regarding any breach of cooperation in line with the UN Charter and the Rome Statute. The UN Secretary General declined Ukraine&apos;s invitation to the first Global Peace Summit in Switzerland. He did, however, accept the invitation to Kazan from war criminal Putin. This is a wrong choice that does not advance the cause of peace. It only damages the UN&apos;s reputation. Finally, the ICC and the Office of the Prosecutor should react to the meeting, as it undermines the credibility of the ICC&#x2019;s decisions. According to Article 18 of the UN-ICC Relationship Agreement, the Office of the Prosecutor should request any information obtained during Guterres&#x2019; meeting with Putin that may be useful for the investigation. By taking these steps, alongside a strong reaction from human rights organizations and international law scholars, a more thorough consideration of any contact between UN officials and individuals wanted by the ICC can be achieved. These measures will ensure adherence to the guidance on contacts with persons subject to ICC arrest warrants and the UN-ICC Relationship Agreement.

Russia possibly behind plot to smuggle flammable parcels onto cargo planes, media reports	Russia may be behind the dispatches of flammable packages via cargo planes in Europe in preparations for similar operations in North America, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal separately reported on Nov. 4, citing European security officials. Intelligence agencies across Europe have warned that Russia is plotting violent acts of sabotage across the continent in response to countries&apos; support for Ukraine. The European officials reportedly suspect Moscow of a plot that saw several parcels sent by individuals to catch fire in Germany and the U.K. in July. This could have led the cargo planes to crash if the fires happened during the flight. The international investigation revealed that the individuals who sent the inflammable parcels also sent non-flammable freights to the U.S. and Canada in what seems to be a test run before more terrorist acts. The Washington Post named a case involving a parcel that caught fire in July in a hub run by the DHL courier in Leipzig, Germany. According to the outlet, the package was sent from Lithuania by plane and marked for delivery to a fake address in Birmingham, U.K. U.K. counter-terrorism officials are also investigating whether Russian intelligence officers planted an incendiary device inside a parcel that caught fire at a warehouse near Birmingham. Polish investigators believe that the fire at Birmingham was also part of the preparations for sabotage operations in North America. Russia has long engaged in a variety of disruptive behavior toward Europe, also using its cyber capabilities to target civilian infrastructure. Moscow is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in the world, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a conference in Prague on Oct. 9.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-possibly-behind-plot-to-smuggle-flammable-parcels-onto-planes-wp/	2024-11-05T00:01:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2169244215.jpg
Zelensky wants to drag Poland into war with Russia,' Polish deputy PM claims	By asking Poland to shoot down Russian missiles over Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky is attempting to get Warsaw involved in the war, Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said in an interview with Radio ZET on Nov. 4. Gawkowski&apos;s comments came amid a growing diplomatic spat between Kyiv and Warsaw, revolving around the Polish support for Ukraine as well as historical grievances. &quot;Zelensky wants Poland to shoot missiles over Ukraine, which means he wants Poland to enter the war, which means he wants Poland to be at war with Russia,&quot; said Gawkowski, who also serves as the digital affairs minister for the co-governing Left coalition. &quot;By these statements, Zelensky wants to drag Poland into the war with Russia.&quot; Zelensky recently criticized Poland for not yet providing its remaining MiG-29 fighter jets despite previous agreements. The president also said he had &quot;constantly asked&quot; Poland to shoot down Russian missiles flying in its direction, particularly to protect the gas storage facility in the town of Stryi in Ukraine&apos;s Lviv Oblast, located nearly 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the Ukrainian-Polish border. Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine but have never been intercepted by the Polish military. Poland&apos;s allies advised the government to exercise restraint when dealing with unidentified airspace violations, according to Warsaw. &quot;I feel that the last words that came from President Zelensky are unworthy of a politician who owes Poland a lot,&quot; Gawkowski reacted. &quot;The equipment that was transferred, the citizens who were taken care of... Poland is a great friend of Ukraine, a transport hub. It seemed to me that in such situations, you say &#xA0;&apos;thank you.&apos;&quot; Poland has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Kyiv to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. It has also provided Ukraine with around $3.5 billion in military aid since 2022 and hosts close to 1 million Ukrainian refugees. Yet, bilateral relations are far from perfect, with the two countries sharing long-standing unresolved grievances. Some of the recent disputes centered around the resolution of the Volyn massacre carried out by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army against Poles during World War II in 1943-44. Gawkowski was not the only Polish official to respond to Zelensky&apos;s criticism. Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski commented that his country has done more for Kyiv &quot;than any other nation.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re trying to help, but we&apos;re also a front-line country. Russia also threatens us, and not everything is possible,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-wants-to-drag-poland-into-war-with-russia-polish-deputy-pm-claims/	2024-11-04T23:15:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2170729615.jpg
Russia's Foreign Ministry renames Europe branch to Department of European Problems	Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry has renamed its former Department of Pan-European Cooperation to the Department of European Problems, the pro-state news outlet Kommersant reported on Nov. 2. Russia has strained its relationship with the West following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, facing heavy sanctions and an international arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for President Vladimir Putin over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children. &quot;Changes in geopolitical realities,&quot; such as &quot;the obvious degradation of multilateral cooperation structures in Europe,&quot; led to the renaming, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Russian pro-state news agency RBK. In another sign of deteriorating relations, Russia announced the suspension of its participation in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly earlier this year. Moscow also blocked access to more than 81 European media outlets, including the Kyiv Independent, as a response to the decision of the Council of the EU that banned access to four key Russian state-run or controlled media outlets: Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Voice of Europe, RIA Novosti, and Izvestiya.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-foreign-ministry-renames-europe-branch/	2024-11-04T22:42:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-626573796--1-.jpg

Thousands in Tbilisi rally again in protest of recent parliamentary elections	Thousands of opposition supporters gathered outside of Georgia&apos;s parliament on Nov. 4 for the second consecutive Monday, protesting the Oct. 26 election, which they allege was rigged with Russian assistance to favor the ruling Georgian Dream party. Demonstrators waved Georgian and EU flags, demanding new elections under international oversight and an investigation into alleged voting irregularities. Key opposition figures, like Badri Japaridze from the Lelo Strong Georgia Coalition, declared they would boycott parliament and hold continuous protests until their demands are met. The protests come amid growing dissatisfaction with Georgian Dream, which critics accuse of authoritarian tendencies and aligning with Moscow at the expense of EU aspirations. Amid the protests, which were closely monitored by riot police, opposition leaders called on the West to withhold recognition of the election results. European election observers reported a divisive election environment with incidents of bribery, double voting, and intimidation. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said on Oct. 27 that the Georgian parliament will approve the government despite the opposition&apos;s protests. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year also sparked mass demonstrations. Shortly after the election results were announced, the European Commission announced on Oct. 30 that the process of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union had been suspended. Although Georgia received EU candidate status last December, the accession process has been &quot;de facto halted due to the course of action taken by the Georgian government since Spring 2024,&quot; &#xA0;the European Commission&apos;s statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/thousands-in-tbilisi-rally-again-in-protest-of-recent-parliamentary-elections/	2024-11-04T21:49:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/georgiaa.jpeg
Ukraine to receive $600 million from World Bank under RISE Initiative	Ukraine has signed agreements with the World Bank totaling nearly $600 million under the &quot;Resilient, Inclusive and Sustainable Enterprise&quot; (RISE) project, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Nov. 4. The project is aimed at supporting small and medium-sized businesses, green initiatives, and digitalization, according to his post on Telegram. Shmyhal announced that the project will run until 2027, with total funding expected to exceed $1 billion. He thanked the World Bank and emphasized that RISE would help strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s economy, enabling businesses to adapt to current challenges. &#x201C;I am grateful to World Bank President Ajay Banga, Managing Director Anna Bjerde and Regional Country Director Bob Saum for their continued involvement and support to Ukraine in times of war,&#x201D; Shmyhal wrote. As the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion continues to put pressure on Ukraine&apos;s economy and business, the World Bank plays a crucial role in supporting the country&apos;s economic sector. Since February 2022, Ukraine has received over $37 billion in budget support through World Bank partnerships. The Peace in Ukraine project has been the primary tool of the World Bank in providing financial assistance for Ukraine from 2022 until today. Over $25 billion has been raised via Peace in Ukraine, and a new deal will increase the amount to almost $30 billion, most of which was provided by the U.S., according to Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-600-million-from-world-bank-under-rise-initiative/	2024-11-04T20:18:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243546154.jpeg
Slovak president denies all requests from citizens wanting to fight in Ukraine	Slovak President Peter Pellegrini recently rejected all four requests from Slovak citizens wishing to join Ukraine&apos;s armed forces, Slovak media source TASR reported on Nov. 3. Pellegrini emphasized that unauthorized foreign military service constitutes a crime subject to prosecution in Slovakia. This decision also reflects his alignment with Prime Minister Robert Fico&#x2019;s stance against military support for Ukraine and contrasts with the policy of Pellegrini&apos;s predecessor, Zuzana Caputova, who had approved similar applications. This Slovak policy differs from neighboring Czechia, where President Petr Pavel has permitted 60 Czech citizens to serve with Ukrainian forces. Ukraine&apos;s International Legion was launched at the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, attracting foreigners who volunteered to defend Ukraine. Citizens from over 50 countries have joined the unit since the start of the full-scale invasion, including military veterans from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Europe, and beyond, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-president-denies-all-requests-from-citizens-wanting-to-fight-in-ukraine/	2024-11-04T18:21:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2136582634.jpg
Despite 'unprecedented' amount of disinformation, no evidence it will directly impact outcome of election, US cybersecurity chief says	Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said on Nov. 4 that the agency had seen no evidence disinformation could directly impact the results of the U.S. election, despite a surge ahead of election day. Throughout the campaign, Russia has been accused of attempting to spread false claims on a number of topics surrounding the election, including disinformation about the candidates and election security. On Nov. 2, the FBI warned that fake videos were circulating online, likely part of a Russian-backed influence campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies and Microsoft have recently warned that foreign adversaries are engaging in influence campaigns to mislead voters ahead of the 2024 election. Both the U.S. government and Microsoft have indicated that Russia favors former President Donald Trump, while Iran supports Vice President Kamala Harris. U.S. intelligence sources said on Oct. 22 that Russian disinformation groups have also been linked to viral attacks targeting Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz. A senior Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency agency told Reuters that there was a high likelihood that disinformation campaigns will continue until the results are formally certified on Jan. 6, 2025. Russia has a storied history of spreading election disinformation, having been at the center of disinformation efforts during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential election. Its disinformation efforts were recently seen in Moldova where Russia attempted to sway influence, driving voters away from Moldova&apos;s accession to the European Union. Despite the efforts, incumbent pro-EU President Maia Sandu narrowly defeated pro-Russian candidate Alexandr Stoianoglo. In early October, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a conference in Prague that Russia is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in the world, amounting to &quot;four times more than the rest of the world combined.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-unprecedented-amount-of-disinformation-no-evidence-it-will-directly-impact-outcome-of-election-us-cybersecurity-chief-says/	2024-11-04T16:33:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2171253368-1.jpg
Harris or Trump — Ukraine braces for best, worst-case scenarios as US elects new president	As Americans head to the polls on Nov. 5, Ukraine is nervously watching the elections being held by its top Western ally as the outcome could determine the country&#x2019;s fate in its fight against Russia&#x2019;s almost three-year-old full-scale invasion. The two candidates&apos; pre-election positions on continuing to support Ukraine with weaponry are in such stark contrast that some experts estimate whoever emerges victorious will impact whether Kyiv stays in the fight or is choked of supplies to the point of capitulation. Vice President Kamala Harris, 60, the Democratic nominee, says she will stand by Kyiv until &#x201C;Ukraine prevails in this war,&#x201D; and that if her opponent were in the White House, Russian President Vladimir Putin would be sitting in the Ukrainian capital. The Republican nominee, former president Donald Trump, 78, recently blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the war starting and has repeatedly said without detail that he will have the war settled on or before inauguration day if he wins. As Russia continues to make gains on the battlefield, Ukrainian officials are reportedly growing more despondent about the future course of the war, with fears the election outcome could leave them fighting Moscow with little or no help from the U.S. or forced into a peace deal on unfavorable terms for Kyiv. Evelyn Farkas, executive director at the McCain Institute, a U.S.-based think tank named in honor of the late Republican senator John McCain, said the best-case election scenario for Ukraine is a full sweep by Harris and her Democratic party, taking the White House and both chambers of Congress. Under that scenario, &#x201C;the U.S. is able to provide reliable assistance to Ukraine in a more than timely fashion &#x2026; it pays sufficient attention to Ukraine, not just with financial resources and weaponry, but it really figures out how it can help Ukraine achieve victory,&#x201D; Farkas told the Kyiv Independent. Both the Senate and House are up for grabs in the election, the outcomes of which will determine how much any sitting president is able to accomplish. Whether Harris is ready to go all-in for Ukraine remains to be seen. But if her campaign statements of support for Kyiv&#x2019;s fight against Moscow are any indication, she is likely to continue a policy of diplomatic and military support for the war-torn country. U.S. Senator Mark Kelly and Congressman from New York Gregory Meeks, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, both told the Kyiv Independent they expect Harris&#x2019;s approach to Ukraine to be similar, although not identical, to Presiden Joe Biden&#x2019;s. The Biden-Harris administration has put the defense of Ukraine on the same level as avoiding World War III, which has been defined by the fear of escalation with Russia, Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told the Kyiv Independent.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The Kremlin has repeatedly rattled the nuclear saber since the start of its full-scale invasion as a way of deterring support for Ukraine. The fear of Russia&#x2019;s reaction is largely believed to be behind Washington&#x2019;s delays in delivering certain weapons like HIMARS and F-16 fighter jets. Who Harris picks for her secretary of state &#x2014; the country&#x2019;s top diplomat &#x2014; and as national security advisor will undoubtedly shape her policies toward Russian aggression in Ukraine and across Europe. The Harris campaign has not made any of its potential cabinet picks public pre-election. In the running for secretary of state are reportedly CIA Director William Burns, Senators Chris Murphy from Connecticut and Chris Coons from Delaware, both Democrats, and former Republican Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona; Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the current U.S. ambassador to the UN; Samantha Power, current head of the U.S. Agency for International Development; and Pete Buttigieg, the current U.S. transportation secretary, Politico and NBC News reported. All of the potential picks for state secretary would likely back a continued policy of high support for Kyiv. Secretaries of state often look to cement their legacy with bold foreign policy decisions. But as many of the candidates already work for Biden, they may well stay the policy course with the war in Ukraine. The cautious approach from the current White House has largely been blamed on Biden and Jake Sullivan, his national security advisor. Should Harris win, her policy toward Ukraine could be heavily influenced by Sullivan&#x2019;s replacement. The vice president&#x2019;s current national security advisor, Phil Gordon, is widely rumored to be her top pick to take on the role. Daalder believes that a Harris-Gordon team on the foreign policy front could be an opportunity for change. Democratic presidential nominee and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris (R) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shake hands during a meeting in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Sept. 26, 2024. (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#x201C;To the extent that Gordon and Harris are not as fully bought into the (fear of escalation) perspective as Biden was, there&apos;s a better opportunity for change under Harris and Gordon than there would be under a continuation of Biden,&#x201D; said Daalder, who has known and worked with Gordon for decades. He added that the two are less likely to be as opposed to kickstarting NATO membership for Ukraine than Biden has been. &#x201C;From the F-16s to not providing ATACAMs, HIMARS, to not being able to strike deep inside Russia with the Storm Shadow, that&apos;s all Biden. There&apos;s no one else in the administration who is as tied to that,&#x201D; he said. Still, in October, Harris dodged a question on Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership, saying Washington will address that &#x201C;if and when it arrives at that point.&#x201D; Regarding a potential Harris presidency with Gordon as national security advisor, Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, said he believes the pair would be a net positive for Ukraine overall. &#x201C;(Gordon) knows Europe well. (Harris) on the campaign trail talks about her seven meetings with Zelensky all the time. Those, I think, are good signs,&#x201D; Michael McFaul, currently a professor of international studies at Stanford University and the co-founder of the Yermak-McFaul Expert Group on Russian Sanctions, told the Kyiv Independent in an interview published on Nov. 3. &#xA0;The expert group is led by Andriy Yermak, Zelensky&#x2019;s chief of staff. &#x201C;I think the transition to a new Harris administration might be more like other transitions where you get new people with new ideas &#x2014; I hope that those people will be ones that understand the importance of defeating Putin&apos;s army in Ukraine,&#x201D; McFaul said. U.S. support for Ukraine in its now almost three-year fight against relentless Russian grinding assaults depends on whether Ukraine retains the will to fight, said Reno Domenico, head of Democrats Abroad in Ukraine. &#x201C;The U.S. is not going to support Ukraine if Ukraine doesn&#x2019;t want to fight,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent. Even if Ukraine retains the will to fight, fears abound that a potential Trump presidency could spell the end of the war on unfavorable terms for Kyiv. In addition to deriding aid to Ukraine and blaming Zelensky for the invasion, Trump has repeatedly said he would bring a swift end to the war &#x2014; even saying he could do so in 24 hours, without providing any details or plans. What worries Kyiv and its allies around the world is that any quick resolution to the war would invariably involve massive concessions to Putin, including the ceding of some 20% of occupied territory to Russia and the abandonment of Ukraine&#x2019;s aspirations to join the NATO military alliance. After the former president met with Zelensky in New York this September &#x2014; their first in five years &#x2014; the Republican nominee said there would be a rapid deal to end the war if he won the election but that it was &#x201C;too early&#x201D; to say how he would do that. Of concern in Ukraine and beyond is also Trump&#x2019;s repeated claims that he has a good relationship with Putin and the close contact the two maintain. &#x201C;We know what Trump is going to do,&#x201D; Domenico said. &#x201C;He has stayed in constant communication with Putin, his friend.&#x201D; Trump has reportedly spoken with Putin as many as seven times since leaving the White House, according to renowned journalist Bob Woodward&#x2019;s latest book. Billionaire Elon Musk, who&#x2019;s been campaigning vigorously for Trump and whose satellite company Starlink has aided Ukraine&#x2019;s Armed Forces, has also reportedly been communicating with Putin and other Kremlin officials since late 2022, according to the Wall Street Journal. On the contrary, Harris said she refuses to meet with Putin for peace talks unless Ukraine is present at the table. Trump has sought to present his friendly relations with Putin as an advantage in negotiating with him to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. But McFaul, the former ambassador to Russia, warns that giving Putin what he wants as part of any potential peace deal would only make him want more. &#x201C;Trump coming to power and signaling that he&apos;s going to reduce or eliminate assistance to Ukraine, that&apos;s going to embolden Putin. He&apos;s going to think my enemy is now weaker. That this is a time to go for more, not less,&#x201D; McFaul told the Kyiv Independent. U.S. Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump dances during a campaign rally at Findlay Toyota Center in Prescott Valley, Arizona, U.S. on Oct. 13, 2024. (Rebecca Noble/Getty Images)&#x201C;I just fear that Trump fundamentally doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine. He still fundamentally does care about his personal relationship with Putin; he&apos;s been very consistent in his support for Putin,&#x201D; McFaul said. Trump&#x2019;s response to Russian aggression, as well as the other global risks present in the world, namely North Korea and Iran, depends on his team, Farkas, of the McCain Institute, said. A team made up of Trump&#x2019;s former National Security Advisor Robert O&#x2019;Brien or former State Secretary Mike Pompeo would understand the threats facing the U.S. and its allies around the world, according to Farkas. In addition to O&#x2019;Brien, the list of candidates for possible state secretary under Trump reportedly includes Richard Grenell, former acting Director of National Intelligence and ambassador to Germany in Trump&#x2019;s first administration; Bill Hagerty, Republican senator from Tennessee; Marco Rubio, Republican senator from Florida, and Mike Waltz, congressman from Florida. Another factor contributing to concerns that Ukraine could be left on its own to fight a much larger enemy is Trump&#x2019;s cozy relationship with Hungary&#x2019;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is also friendly with Putin and openly against aid to Ukraine. Trump&#x2019;s possible return to the White House is only expected to further embolden Orban. The two have met on multiple occasions, including once in July in Florida at Trump&#x2019;s Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago residence almost immediately after the Hungarian leader met Putin. Following the meeting, Orban endorsed Trump&#x2019;s candidacy in the election, and in a tweet called the visit his &#x201C;peace mission 5.0,&#x201D; writing: &#xA0;&quot;We discussed ways to make #peace. The good news of the day: he&#x2019;s going to solve it!&#x201D; referring to the war in Ukraine. During his first term in office, Trump took a hammer to the U.S.&#x2019;s transatlantic relations and threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO. Largely in response, the U.S. Congress approved legislation in 2023 that would make it impossible for any president to withdraw the U.S. from NATO without approval from the Senate or an Act of Congress. One of the lawmakers to spearhead the move was Senator Rubio, one of Trump&#x2019;s potential picks to head the State Department. However, Trump&#x2019;s former national security advisor John Bolton, who has distanced himself from his former boss, said on Nov. 3 that U.S. withdrawal from NATO under a second Trump administration is a &#x201C;real possibility.&#x201D; &#x201C;It would be a catastrophic mistake for the U.S. to withdraw from NATO, but it&apos;s a real possibility in a second Trump Administration. It would be a terrible blow to American and broader Western interests worldwide,&#x201D; Bolton tweeted. If Trump wins back the White House, it is expected that Ukraine will further realize the extent of its dependence on America, and as a result, Europe will increasingly be on the receiving end of requests for aid. Congressman Meeks says that should Trump win, it&#x2019;s critical for Ukraine that Democrats retain control of the House. Even if Harris wins, she&#x2019;ll likely struggle to get Ukraine aid through Congress, which is currently split with Democrats in control of the Senate and Republicans atop the House.

There are others who have sought to assuage fears of Trump&#x2019;s possible return to the White House and what that could mean for Ukraine. Boris Johnson, the former British Prime Minister who&#x2019;s been one of Kyiv&#x2019;s loudest advocates, remains hopeful that a Trump presidency wouldn&#x2019;t spell the end of American support for Ukraine. &#x201C;I hear what people say, I am very concerned, but I believe on the basis of what Trump has done in the past, that he will be robust,&#x201D; Johnson, who discussed Ukraine with Trump in July, said in an interview with CNN. He referenced the Javelin missiles Trump approved for Ukraine in 2017. &#x201C;For this instinctive reason I cannot believe that a guy who is so passionate about his country, about making America great again will want to kick off his next presidential term by basically allowing the Soviet empire to be great again, I can&#x2019;t believe that he will allow that to happen.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/harris-or-trump-whats-in-store-for-ukraine/	2024-11-04T15:28:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/US-GettyImages-2180589131.jpg
North Korean FM meets with Putin in Moscow	North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Nov. 4, as Choe&apos;s state visit of Russia continues. Choe&apos;s visit comes as 11,000 North Korean troops are reportedly preparing to enter combat alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. Choe conveyed to Putin &quot;sincere, warm, comradely greetings&quot; from North Korean dictator Kim Jung-Un during their meeting, as Russia celebrates the public holiday &quot;Unity Day.&quot; Choe met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Nov. 1, following her arrival, vowing that North Korea would stand with Russia &quot;until the day of victory&quot; during talks. No additional details on the meeting between Choe and Putin were provided, as the two countries seek to strengthen their relationship. The Korea Herald newspaper reported on Nov. 3, citing a lawmaker familiar with the matter, that North Korea is believed to receive cash, food, and space technology from Russia as compensation for entering the war on its side. Moscow and Pyongyang signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, pledging to provide military support to one another if either comes under attack. The Russian parliament ratified the defense treaty in October, amid reports that North Korea was sending troops along with weapons to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on Oct. 29 that Putin was not planning to meet with Choe during her visit to Russia, independent Russian media outlet Meduza reported. It is unclear as to what led to the scheduling change. Earlier in the day, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, Andrii Kovalenko, claimed on Nov. 4 that the first North Korean soldiers stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to aid Moscow&apos;s war have come under fire.

Overstretched Ukrainian forces struggle to contain Russian advance as US elections loom	As American voters head to the polls in presidential elections set to decisively steer the trajectory of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine, the situation on the battlefield is beginning to unravel for Kyiv. After two years of brutal attritional warfare across southern and eastern Ukraine, dynamism has returned to the front line. According to a Bloomberg analysis published on Nov. 1, Ukraine has lost 1,146 square kilometers of its own territory since the launch of the Kursk Oblast incursion in early August, with the week up until Nov. 1 reported as the worst in terms of lost territory in all of 2024. On Nov. 2, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said that Ukraine was facing &#x201C;one of the most powerful&#x201D; Russian offensives since the start of the all out war. Over autumn, large chunks of Ukrainian territory, sometimes including entire cities, have been lost on a near-daily basis in southern Donetsk Oblast, while Russian forces have also made operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, Kupiansk, as well as on their own soil in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian servicemen from the 15th Operational Brigade cover up a 152 mm Howitzer 2A65 Msta-B after firing it towards Russian positions near the front line in the Pokrovsk area in Donetsk Oblast, on Oct. 5, 2024. (Maciek Musialek/Anadolu via Getty Images)&#xA0;The increasing pace of Russia&#x2019;s advance is evidence of how the war of attrition that many officials and analysts in the West had called a &#x201C;stalemate,&#x201D; had, slowly but surely, been flowing in Moscow&#x2019;s favor. With manpower shortage and systemic structural issues at the heart of Ukraine&#x2019;s predicament, the options for Kyiv and its partners to stabilize the front in the face of Russia&#x2019;s acute resource advantages look limited. The most critical sector of the front line as of early November is in the southern half of the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donetsk Oblast. After advancing quickly beyond Avdiivka towards the key logistical hub of Pokrovsk over summer, Russian forces pivoted south in early September, cutting off a large pocket of Ukrainian-held land west of the Vovcha River with the successful capture of the city of Ukrainsk. Further Russian advances toward Pokrovsk initially slowed over autumn, halted at the gates of the city of Selydove, where the relatively fresh 15th National Guard Brigade took over the defense of the mining city once home to over 22,000 people. Over the next two months, however, instead of storming Selydove, the Russian troops picked away at the fields on either flank, which were both manned by more exhausted Ukrainian brigades plagued by personnel losses.

Heavy losses and relentless enemy assaults forced what was left of Ukraine&#x2019;s 72nd Mechanized Brigade and other attached units to withdraw from the city across fields swarming with Russian drones. The fall of Vuhledar handed Russia a significant advantage in the fight for the vast open fields north of the city, the position of which on higher ground allows for the placement of antennas enabling reconnaissance and strike drones to fly deep behind Ukrainian lines. View by drone of the bombed-out town of the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast on Aug. 22, 2024. (Gaelle Girbes/Getty Images)As of early November, Ukrainian lines northwest of Vuhledar have incurred successive local collapses, leading to some of the most rapid Russian gains since the early months of the full-scale invasion. Piercing through Ukrainian lines before clearing the positions in between the breakthroughs, Russian forces advanced over ten kilometers north across the open steppe, bringing them closer to the main road leading into the city of Kurakhove. Kurakhove, whose large thermal power station was still working back at the start of 2024, is now itself quickly being encircled on three sides. If not contained, Russia&#x2019;s southern Donetsk offensive could soon spill out of the oblast&#x2019;s own boundaries. The advances now threaten the western town of Velyka Novosilka, and beyond it, the eastern borders of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts. As dramatically as the front line has moved in southern Donetsk Oblast, it is not the only sector of the front line where recent Russian gains represent a serious cause for concern for the Ukrainian defense. Northwest of Pokrovsk, heavy urban fighting continues in the twin cities of Toretsk and Niu York, where Russian forces continue to make small incremental gains through the cities&#x2019; ruined streets. Over spring and summer, Ukraine&#x2019;s defense of Chasiv Yar, just five kilometers west of the destroyed city of Bakhmut, seemed to be a relative bright spot on the front line.

(Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)A visualization of Russian advances around Chasiv Yar Oblast over autumn 2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)There, Ukraine&#x2019;s experienced 24th Mechanized Brigade had held Russian forces at a near standstill on the western edge of the city for months, aided greatly by the formidable defensive barrier that is the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas Canal. But after sustained pressure, countless failed assaults, and the mass use of drones complicating the Ukrainian defense, Russian forces breached the canal in mid-October, both along the main highway into Bakhmut, and inside the urban area of Chasiv Yar itself. If Russian forces can cement their presence on the western side of the canal and advance further, they could close the distance to the cities of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, and Druzhkivka.

Ukraine&#x2019;s hold on the territory east of the Oskil River, which Kupiansk straddles, has been put under real threat by Russian advances, most notably around Pishchane, where a new Russian salient gradually pierced through 15 kilometers of Ukrainian-held territory to reach the riverbank. Meanwhile, in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine&#x2019;s surprise incursion had initially overwhelmed the thin defenses on the state border, Kyiv is also now squarely on the back foot. Ukraine&#x2019;s hold over Russian territory has shrunk to almost half its original expanse as fresh Russian forces sent there took back a slew of settlements in successive counteroffensive pushes. A visualization of Russian advances around Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast over autumn 2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)A visualization of Russian advances around Kursk Oblast over autumn 2024. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)On top of the initial force that broke through in August, Kyiv has been forced to commit some of its strongest units to prop up the defense of the areas controlled in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, a task only expected to become harder as North Korean troops enter the fight. The only major part of the front line that has been notably quieter has been in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, but this might not be the case for long. Over summer and autumn, Russian forces have slowly carved away at the small salient that Kyiv retook at immense cost in the 2023 summer counteroffensive, and now, with many stronger units peeled off the Zaporizhzhia front line, the threat of a new Russian push from the south looms high. Throughout 2024, one issue that has been consistent across the board for Ukraine on the battlefield is the lack of quality manpower. Now, although itself exacerbated by ammunition shortages, poor fortifications, and issues in command, it is precisely Ukraine&#x2019;s dire manpower situation that has been the main factor allowing Russia to advance at greater pace along the front line, according to three officers who spoke to the Kyiv Independent from three different sectors in Donetsk Oblast. The greatest problem is, as always, in the infantry, whose job of holding zero line positions in the face of daily Russian assaults, bombardment, and drone attacks is consistently the most dangerous and least desirable. The reasons for the shortage are well-documented, first and foremost rooted in Ukraine&#x2019;s struggle over 2024 to mobilize and properly train enough combat-capable men. Ukraine&#x2019;s new mobilization law &#x2014; finally passed in April this year &#x2014; lowered the draft age to 25, expanded data collection for all eligible men, but did not offer an end point for military service after a clause setting the term for demobilization at 36 months was removed at the last minute. &#x201C;Of course, we need a breath of fresh air, and at the very least, a reliable rear guard,&#x201D; said a senior officer fighting near Kurakhove, who requested to remain anonymous, to the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;But we see a very different picture: donations are dwindling, people don&#x2019;t want to join the army because, as always, something doesn&#x2019;t sit right with them. As a result, soldiers are already exhausted, both mentally and physically.&#x201D; Ukrainian servicemen of the 56th Motorized Brigade walk with weapons along a dirt road during training on Oct. 22, 2024 in Donetsk Oblast.

On top of Ukraine&#x2019;s chronic issues with its basic training, which is often inadequate and dominated by Soviet-era practices, many newly-mobilized soldiers end up in newly-formed brigades, which &#x2014; without any combat experience &#x2014; inevitably end up taking more losses and suffering more cases of desertion once sent to battle. &#xA0; On the battlefield, these problems ultimately end up compounding. Inadequate mobilization leads to not enough soldiers to replenish ranks or create enough new brigades, while issues with training, the selection of older, less-fit men, and the sending of new brigades without combat experience into battle in turn leads to higher losses and the need to mobilize even more people. Over time, if they take losses that aren&#x2019;t being replenished for long enough, even Ukraine&#x2019;s strongest and battle-hardened brigades begin to quickly lose their combat effectiveness as units. &quot;The manpower situation has deteriorated over the past year,&quot; said Rob Lee, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. &quot;Most brigades rarely rotate from the front line, which can lead to exhaustion and degradation over time. &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s 110th and 72nd mechanized brigades had both held Avdiivka and Vuhledar since 2022 before Russia captured them after lengthy and costly assaults.&quot; Ukrainian military veteran Viacheslav Rybachuk whose brother, a Ukrainian soldier Oleksiy was killed in Bakhmut area in 2023, kneels down at a designated area for commemorating fallen Ukrainian and foreign fighters, during the Independence Day of Ukraine, in the Independence Square in Kyiv, on Aug. 24, 2024. (Photo by Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)&#xA0;Ukraine is working on combatting the Soviet-era legacy in its draft system, former Ukrainian commander-in-chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi said in October, while Kyiv has also tapped into a new source of manpower by allowing prisoners to serve, mostly as infantry. Meanwhile, recent reports of the sending of specialists from artillery, air defense, and other specialist units to the infantry to replenish losses testify to the depth of the crisis across the military. Amid daily long-range drone attacks on Kyiv, controversial MP Mariana Beuzhla claimed on Nov. 2 that air defense specialists were being sent to the infantry, a fact tacitly confirmed by Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat. One commander fighting north of Chasiv Yar said that by the end of summer, his battalion&#x2019;s infantry had completely run out, with artillerymen and drone operators sent in groups of 2-4 to occupy zero-line positions one at a time. As much as Ukraine continues to struggle with its own manpower crisis, much of Russia&#x2019;s success continues to be to Russia&#x2019;s overwhelming numbers advantage, both in manpower, ammunition, and equipment. Russian forces have also continued to refine the the practice of targeting the weak points in Ukrainian lines, manned by more poorly-trained, poorly-equipped or simply more exhausted brigades. The problem is especially acute in southern Donetsk Oblast, where the greatest Russian gains have been made in sectors defended by Territorial Defense (TDF) units. &#x201C;Neighboring units lose their positions without reporting it to their higher command because they are scared of being punished for retreating,&#x201D; said the officer fighting near Kurakhove. &#x201C;While they continue to report that they are holding, the Russians come in and take control of them, and in doing so, often cut off our troops.&#x201D; This systematic overstretching, according to Lee, has ultimately only been exacerbated further by the Kursk Oblast incursion, which only lengthened the active front line that Ukrainian unites needed to defend. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi (R). (Oleksandr Syrskyi/Telegram)&quot;Kursk has further stretched Ukrainian forces,&quot; said Lee, &quot;leaving commanders with fewer reinforcements and reserves to respond to Russian advances elsewhere.&quot; Amid this unending pressure, Ukraine&#x2019;s higher command often reacts in a way that is controversial at best and self-destructive at worst: peeling off battalions and even companies from brigades and sending them to other sectors of the front line under the command of different brigades. What results is a chaotic, disjointed command structure that seeks to constantly fight fires, at the detriment to overall combat effectiveness. &quot;Instead of operating as cohesive units, many brigades have also piecemeal deployed battalions to other parts of the front line, which leaves them weakened,&quot; said Lee. &quot;This and other stop gap measures are only short-term solutions, and they create greater problems the longer they are employed.&quot; Looking ahead to the coming winter on the battlefield, the greatest unknown remains the question of how long Russia can continue to attack at this rate across so many fronts. As Moscow expanded offensive operations through summer and autumn, its losses have also surged. On Nov. 4, Russian personnel losses reported by Ukraine&#x2019;s General Staff passed the 700,000 mark, with daily figures often passing the 1,200 mark. Moscow&#x2019;s move to double the sign-up bonus for contract soldiers in July, as well as the bringing in of thousands of North Korean soldiers to the fight, are testament to the fact that Russia&#x2019;s own manpower resources are not infinite. Still, these signs of strain are yet to translate into slowing down, let alone actual culmination, on the battlefield. &quot;The situation on the battlefield this winter primarily depends on how long Russian can continue to recruit 20,000-30,000 volunteers per month,&quot; said Lee.

Come next year, much of Ukraine&#x2019;s fate will likely be decided by the next occupant of the White House. But in the meantime, Ukrainian soldiers say, the country must tackle its own problems if Russia&#x2019;s advance is to be stopped. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s completely possible to stabilize the lines if everything and everyone worked for the front,&#x201D; said the senior officer fighting near Kurakhove, &#x201C;they could mobilize healthy, ordinary men. People back home could donate like they did in the early days. &#x201C;Then we would have the means and reliable infantry. But, unfortunately, that sounds like a dream right now&#x2026; it&#x2019;s far away from the reality.&quot; Hi, this is Francis Farrell, who wrote this piece, which, while it certainly won&apos;t fill you with hope, might just be a reminder of what is still at stake in this war. Well, this is it, this is the moment that could make or break Ukraine&apos;s struggle for existence, independence, and freedom, and it will be decided by millions of people an ocean away from Ukraine. Whatever the result of the election, the winter ahead is going to be a very dark and very unpredictable one, but none of that means we will stop our work for a second.

Germany to provide $217 million in humanitarian winter aid for Ukraine	During a visit to Kyiv on Nov. 4, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced that the country will provide 200 million euros ($217 million) in humanitarian winter aid, as Ukraine prepares for more Russian attacks against energy infrastructure. Baerbock said that the aid funding would be used to support those affected by severe energy disruptions so &quot;Ukrainians can be provided with essentials such as blankets or warm winter coats to protect them from freezing temperatures.&quot; Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian energy facilities ahead of the winter months, as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. The interim head of Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo, Oleksiy Brekht, said on Oct. 29 that the country may be facing its most challenging winter since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The German minister announced the aid funding following her meeting with Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;We are countering this brutality with our humanity and support, so that Ukrainians can not only survive the winter, but so that their country can survive,&quot; Baerbock said upon arrival, according to Reuters. The additional humanitarian aid is allocated separately from previous commitments from Germany to boost Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure ahead of the upcoming winter. According to Baerbock, Berlin has committed an additional 170 million euros ($185 million) to boost Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure. Germany has played a key role in providing energy support to Ukraine and bolstering the country&apos;s air defenses needed to repel further attacks. During the meeting in Kyiv, the delegations also discussed the &quot;need for decisive action&quot; in response to the presence of North Korean troops situated along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front, Sybiha said.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-announces-218-million-in-humanitarian-winter-aid-for-ukraine/	2024-11-04T13:28:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GOGzPNpWQAA56sT.jpeg
Editorial: When casting your vote in the US, think about Ukraine	As Americans cast their ballots in the Nov. 5 presidential election, we, the staff of the Kyiv Independent, ask voters in the &#x201C;beacon of democracy&#x201D; to consider once again why the iconic Statue of Liberty stands on an island in New York Harbor. It was gifted to the U.S. by the people of France, whose support of the 13 colonies&#x2019; fight for independence centuries ago proved critical to their victory. The rest is history, but the future is far from certain. How it unfolds depends on whether the U.S. slips into isolationism like it did before ultimately being pulled into World War II or leads the free world once again. As a Ukrainian publication based in Kyiv, we are far from trying to tell U.S. voters who to support in the election &#x2014; it is fully in the right of the American people to elect whoever they see fit to lead their country. But we do want to ask all of you who cast a ballot on Tuesday to think about Ukraine and factor it in when making your choice. We aren&#x2019;t just asking this as a Ukrainian team that has a personal stake in the war. We are asking this because it is our responsibility, as the people who are close enough to the fight to understand what&#x2019;s at stake, to give the rest of the world the warning it deserves to hear. U.S. history and the very foundation of the American nation can serve as a reminder of why Ukraine must get the support to win the war, and why the U.S. should continue to lead the global effort to aid Ukraine &#x2014; no matter who is in the White House. Americans &#x2014; who will choose either Vice President Kamala Harris or Donald Trump as their next leader &#x2014; should be mindful that Ukraine, in its standoff against an imperialist Russia, is today fighting a similar fight for freedom as America&#x2019;s ancestors did. With continued and hopefully more robust backing from the U.S. and its allies, Ukraine&apos;s victory will only further strengthen America&#x2019;s hand, as well as global security. Preserving strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress, where legislators will also be elected in addition to the presidential vote, will be a crucial part of achieving such an outcome for America, Ukraine, and those around the world keen on preserving international rules-based order. We are living in precarious times. &quot;For the first time since Adolf Hitler, Russian President Vladimir Putin has pursued the largest ground war in continental Europe, threatening the annihilation of a nation and its people.&quot; American global leadership is being challenged in Ukraine and other parts of the world by Russia and other members of what has been called an &#x201C;axis of evil.&#x201D; They include North Korea, with its troops reportedly set for combat against Ukraine alongside Russia&#x2019;s army, Iran, which has also militarily aided the Kremlin, and China, which has been crucial in keeping Russia&#x2019;s economy and military production afloat. The lessons of World War II tell us that a bigger global standoff, perhaps World War III, can best be avoided not by appeasing dictators for fear of a larger conflict but by stopping them before the war escalates into a global one. Providing more weaponry to Ukraine to help it decisively defeat Russia is the best chance to prevent such much-feared escalation. Americans should also know that supporting Ukraine is a moral responsibility, given that Russia&#x2019;s war is genocidal. It has the intent of destroying Ukraine as a nation, wiping out its democracy, history, and culture. Russia has gone as far as stealing Ukrainian children, a war crime that triggered the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for President Putin. Stopping such atrocities should not be a matter of political debate. The only thing that should be up for debate is how best to stop them. Surely, having Russia occupy more Ukrainian territory or dropping support for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense so that it is forced to capitulate in a &#x201C;ceasefire&#x201D; or pseudo-peace agreement is not the way. The obvious solution is for Russia to be defeated in its own war. Ukraine must win. This would set an example for other hostile and oppressive regimes. Will China try to militarily take over Taiwan if it sees Moscow fail with massive losses and costs against a smaller foe backed by the West? It&#x2019;s impossible to say, but it will likely think twice. The clear-cut solution is to provide Ukraine with enough weaponry to win. This includes capabilities that President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for. This means giving Ukraine missiles and drones for long-range, deep strikes upon the war machine of Russia, whose invading forces continue to bombard cities and towns across Ukraine daily, killing and injuring civilians. The weaponry provided by the U.S. and Kyiv&#x2019;s other Western allies are not freebies. Not only do they power the donor countries&#x2019; defense industries and create jobs, but they also allow Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to prepare for a new type of warfare, and be ready to deter future threats. Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and the asymmetric tactics Ukraine&#x2019;s outmanned and outgunned forces have used to stay in the fight have changed the future of warfare. Drones costing only thousands of dollars, operated by troops in safe cover or even relying on artificial intelligence algorithms, are routinely used to destroy conventional weaponry, such as tanks that cost millions of dollars. The defense industries and countries of the NATO military alliance are giving stockpiles from the past to Ukraine now, knowing they are learning with Kyiv&#x2019;s help how to produce the weaponry of the future that will be key to deterring China &#x2014; or standoff against it should a trans-Pacific war erupt. The chances of this happening shrink if Ukraine gets the kit needed to defeat Russia. It&#x2019;s in the power of the U.S. people to bring that day closer. They can do it every day by demanding that their government backs Ukraine&#x2019;s victory. This Tuesday, they can do it by voting for whoever they see fit to help Ukraine win the war. We understand that domestic issues are a priority for many voters. We are calling on them to also place the deserved gravitas on the issue of Russia&#x2019;s threat to the world, and the U.S. moral duty to help stop it. And when the U.S. helps Ukraine win, perhaps it can once again symbolically solidify its long-term status as the leader of the free world by gifting Ukraine its own version of the Statue of Liberty &#x2014; like it was gifted to their ancestors when they won their war.	https://kyivindependent.com/editorial-us-election/	2024-11-04T12:48:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2176075302.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Artillery supplies from partners for Kyiv have increased, Zelensky says	Key developments on Nov. 4: Ukraine has begun receiving increasingly more military assistance from international partners, namely in terms of artillery, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 4. &quot;We are recording an increased supply of defense aid packages. The situation with artillery has improved,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram after a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&apos;s Staff. The statement comes several days after Zelensky complained that Kyiv had received only close to 10% of military assistance approved by U.S. Congress in April. The U.S. has recently announced several large-scale aid packages for Ukraine, most recently $425 million worth of ammunition, arms, vehicles, and other support unveiled on Nov. 1. The Pentagon seeks to ship in defense aid before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office in January. There are fears that if Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump defeats his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the Nov. 5 election, Washington might scale down its support for Kyiv. Ukraine finds itself in an increasingly difficult situation on the battlefield, facing shortages not only in materiel but also in manpower as the mobilization drive stalls. Speaking after the meeting, Zelensky was briefed on the &quot;destruction of Russian forces&quot; near the Ukrainian border in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The president also discussed drone supplies for the military with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, saying that the &quot;approved supply plans are being carried out.&quot; &quot;I instructed the defense minister to increase orders of Ukrainian drones further,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine is not holding direct talks with Russia on an energy ceasefire but is open to a third country mediating the implementation of the peace formula talks, said Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, in a televised interview on Nov. 4. The official said this in response to multiple media publications that claimed Kyiv and Moscow are holding preliminary discussions on mutually stopping strikes on energy facilities. After the Qatar-mediated talks allegedly first fell through in August in the wake of the Kursk incursion, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29 that the parties are considering resuming the discussions. The Kremlin denied the resumption of talks in a statement on Oct. 30. Speaking in Montreal, Canada, Yermak refuted any direct negotiations with Moscow. He added that a thematic international conference, co-organized by Qatar, on implementing the security aspect of Ukraine&apos;s peace formula took place online in August without Russian participation. The official said that Kyiv would not rule out the possibility of reaching an agreement based on the thematic conference through intermediaries, naming Qatar or &quot;any other country&quot; that would help the parties implement the conclusions. &quot;After that, we said that if today, Qatar or any other country is ready to implement these agreements separately with Ukraine and separately with Russia, please do,&quot; Yermak said. The third point of Ukraine&apos;s peace formula denounces Russian strikes against the Ukrainian energy grid and urges tougher sanctions to undermine Moscow&apos;s capability to sustain these attacks. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the idea of a mutual cessation of energy strikes to implement this goal was proposed during the first global peace summit in Switzerland in June. He said that a willingness on Russia&#x2019;s part to halt the strikes might signal a willingness to start broader peace talks. An agreement would mark the most significant de-escalation of the war since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Yermak stressed that no such agreement is currently being discussed with Russia. North Korea has already deployed 11,000 troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 4, citing Ukraine&apos;s intelligence report. &quot;We see an increase in the number of North Koreans, and we do not see an increase in the reaction of our partners,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence reported on Nov. 2 that Russia deployed more than 7,000 North Korean troops from Russia&apos;s Primorsky Krai closer to the Ukrainian border. These numbers almost coincide with those of Washington earlier this week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that some 8,000 North Korean troops are amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. Almost two-thirds of Ukrainians said they are ready to endure the war as long as it takes, a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed on Nov. 4. A further 15% of respondents said they were willing to bear the burden of the war for a few more months, and 4% said they could endure it for six months. Some 6% percent said they are ready to endure for a year, and 12% could not answer. According to the poll, positions on the matter have remained mostly stable since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022. However, there was a slight drop in those willing to endure the war for as long as needed&#x2013;from 73% in December 2023 and February 2024 to 63% in October. The number of those who supported continuing the resistance only for a shorter period of time has also grown. This trend was especially noticeable in the south and east, where the share of respondents willing to endure the war for a year or more went from 71% to 57% and 73% to 48%, respectively. The population of western and central Ukraine expressed high support and confidence regarding the resistance. The poll was conducted between Sept. 20 and Oct. 3. on a representative sample of 989 people. It excluded those who fled abroad or lived in the Russian-occupied territories. Ukraine finds itself in an increasingly difficult situation in the war. Russian forces keep advancing in the east at a pace unseen in 2024 while the country braces for renewed strikes on the energy grid and possible blackouts during winter. Canada sent the first U.S.-made National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) to Ukraine, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told President Volodymyr Zelensky on Nov. 4. &quot;We expect to receive it by the end of this year,&quot; Zelensky said after the call. Trudeau announced in January 2023 that the country would purchase the $406 million NASAMS for Kyiv. Ottawa reportedly paid for the system later in the spring, but its delivery has been delayed. Earlier in the day, Zelensky said that Ukraine has begun receiving increasingly more military assistance from partners, namely in terms of artillery. The NASAMS systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid the escalating Russian airstrikes. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Canada has committed 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.2 billion) in military aid for Kyiv since the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-artillery-supplies-from-partners-for-kyiv-have-increased-zelensky-says/	2024-11-04T12:46:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1759371571.jpg
Ukraine, Lithuania to produce drones, electronic warfare under new memorandum	Ukraine and Lithuania signed a defense industry memorandum of understanding, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Nov. 4. Under the document, Kyiv and Vilnius will jointly produce drones and parts for them, ammunition and components, and electronic warfare systems. &quot;Lithuania is our loyal friend who helps us diplomatically, economically and, most importantly, militarily,&quot; Umerov said. Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Lithuania has provided Ukraine with military support worth over 683 million euros (approximately $763 million). The parties also discussed plans for 2025 aimed at providing Kyiv with more military assistance, and analyzed Russia&apos;s plans for the fall and winter. In addition, Ukraine&apos;s intelligence shared with Vilnius detailed information on the battlefield situation. In September, Vilnius announced plans to allocate 10 million euros ($11 million) to buy new Ukrainian-made Palianytsia missile-drones for Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-lithuania-to-produce-drones-electronic-warfare-under-new-memorandum/	2024-11-04T11:50:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-04_19-12-33.jpg
14 essential Kyiv Independent stories about the US presidential election	Voting in arguably one of the most consequential elections of modern times is set to conclude on Nov. 5, as U.S. citizens will pick their country&apos;s 47th president. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump enter the home stretch neck-and-neck, according to recent polls, with neither of the candidates reportedly having a definitive lead in seven battleground states. While U.S. presidential elections are routinely closely watched by countries around the world, perhaps none have as much at stake this time around as Ukraine. As the country battles what Kyiv&apos;s military leadership has described as one of &quot;the most powerful offensives&quot; by Russia since the beginning of the all-out invasion, Trump continues to raise doubts about future U.S. military assistance for Ukraine, while insisting he can broker a swift peace agreement. Harris is largely expected to continue the slow-paced yet generally Kyiv-friendly policy of outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden. &#x201C;We will work with any president that the people of the United States chooses,&#x201D; &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists in late October. &#x201C;We hope that the policy of the United States will not change, and they will continue to support us.&#x201D; &#x201C;If the support decreases of course, we will count on ourselves, and on unity in Europe, and on the public opinion of the American people.&#x201D; Here are 14 stories about the 2024 U.S. presidential election published by the Kyiv Independent throughout the campaign. Trump selected Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate on July 15. Vance is one of Trump&apos;s most vocal supporters and an outspoken critic of U.S. aid to Ukraine. He has also said it would be &quot;completely irresponsible&quot; for Ukraine to join NATO. He also argued for the U.S. to focus solely on preventing Chinese expansion, even if that means sacrificing sovereign Ukrainian lands to Russia. While it is likely that if elected Harris&#x2019;s policies toward Ukraine would remain similar to Biden&#x2019;s, her appearances at three consecutive Munich Security Conferences &#x2014; the first being in 2022 just five days before the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion &#x2014; offered clues into the exact stance she could take. With U.S. President Biden officially out of the running for re-election, Ukrainian soldiers, experts, and advocates had fresh hope that the 81-year-old politician with decades of transatlantic diplomacy experience would increase support for the country during his final months in office. Though Ukraine&#x2019;s Western allies have provided Ukraine with massive amounts of weaponry since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, supplies have at times arrived with delays, triggering officials to complain they were not being given enough to defeat Moscow on the battlefield. Harris has selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz &#x2014; an outspoken Ukraine supporter &#x2014; &#xA0;as her running mate for the U.S. presidential election. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Walz has been a vocal advocate for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, signing legislation barring state agencies from doing business with Russian and Belarusian companies. His state is also home to weapons manufacturers that supply arms critical for Ukraine&#x2019;s defense. Moments after officially accepting the Democrats&#x2019; nomination for president of the U.S. on Aug. 22, the night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Harris reminded voters that foreign policy cannot be completely sidelined in the 2024 election. &#x201C;As president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies,&#x201D; Harris firmly said with a raised voice to an erupting crowd of rowdy Democrats. The vice president&apos;s remarks were light on policy but consistent in support of Ukraine&#x2019;s pushback against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, and came after her sprint of a campaign has received criticism for little attention to foreign policy concerns. News that $6 billion worth of outstanding U.S. military aid to Ukraine could expire by the end of September if Congress didn&#x2019;t take urgent action unsettled some in Kyiv, where the painful memory of a larger package delay that led to battlefield losses remained fresh. A series of logistical constraints on U.S. Congressional members&#x2019; travel to Ukraine increasingly raised concerns about the effectiveness of American diplomacy, members of Congress and Congressional advisors told the Kyiv Independent. As the Nov. 5 presidential election in the U.S. approached, debate was intensifying over whether Donald Trump would act in the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The revelations fit with Trump&apos;s track record of praising Putin and seeking a friendlier relationship with Russia. Analysts say that Trump likes Putin because he views himself along with the Russian leader as &quot;strongmen.&quot; In the final weeks of campaigning, a top focus for many Republicans was rebooting a wave of evangelical support that proved crucial to the party taking the White House in 2016. And Trump wasn&apos;t the only one courting evangelicals &#x2014; the mostly conservative group has for months been a focus of Ukrainian lobbying efforts seeking to expand and cement Republican support for Ukraine. After serving nearly three months in the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, a unit within the country&#x2019;s army composed of fighters from abroad, Manus McCaffery became a hometown hero in Parma, Ohio, home to one of the largest diaspora communities in the U.S. with roots from Ukraine. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m extremely uncertain, it&#x2019;s tough because I want to balance what I think is best for America, but also, in a lot of ways, I&apos;m a one-issue person because I care about Ukraine so much,&#x201D; McCaffery told the Kyiv Independent. A plan reportedly being considered by Trump to freeze Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion if he becomes president is &quot;unrealistic,&quot; a Ukrainian lawmaker told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 29. Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy, said that upon taking office, Trump would soon have to &quot;face reality,&quot; and any such plan would fail in light of political realities. Just ten days before the election, nearly a dozen went door-knocking in Montgomery County, where one of the country&#x2019;s largest Ukrainian populations now has voter material available in Ukrainian for the first time. The county includes non-voting recent emigres from Biden&#x2019;s post-full-scale invasion Uniting for Ukraine parole program and thousands more with U.S. citizenship who arrived in the 1990s. Democratic candidate Harris&#x2019;s campaign promises to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia would seemingly make her the obvious choice for Ukrainians in the U.S. in the 2024 presidential elections, but the diaspora is anything but united in their choice for president. Despite Trump&#x2019;s open hostility to aid for Ukraine and apparent close relations with Putin, some Ukrainian American voters feel he&#x2019;s the one who could end the war swiftly. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, professor of international studies at Stanford University, and the co-founder of the Yermak-McFaul Expert Group on Russian Sanctions, to talk about the U.S. elections and what their outcome could mean for Ukraine, Russia, and the future of the rules-based world order. &#x201C;I am deeply worried about a second Trump presidency, both because of what he might want to do intentionally and because of what his signaling of weakness might provoke unintentionally,&#x201D; McFaul said.	https://kyivindependent.com/14-essential-kyiv-independent-stories-about-the-us-presidential-election-2/	2024-11-04T11:33:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170583811.jpg
Number of North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast increases to 11,000, Zelensky says	North Korea has already deployed 11,000 troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 4, citing Ukraine&apos;s intelligence report. &quot;We see an increase in the number of North Koreans, and we do not see an increase in the reaction of our partners,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence reported on Nov. 2 that Russia deployed more than 7,000 North Korean troops from Russia&apos;s Primorsky Krai closer to the Ukrainian border. These numbers almost coincide with those of Washington earlier this week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that some 8,000 North Korean troops are amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. Zelensky said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are gathering. Recently, Kyiv has been issuing warnings that the deployment of North Korean troops in combat is only a matter of days. Ukraine believes that Russia is preparing to send 12,000 North Korean soldiers to join its war, including special forces. According to Zelensky, Russia has confirmed to the West the involvement of Pyongyang&apos;s forces in the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/number-of-north-korean-troops-in-kursk-oblast-increases-to-11-000-zelensky-says/	2024-11-04T11:24:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178159410.jpg
Russia's first peace offer in 2022 was all but Ukraine's surrender, leaked documents show	Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) investigation project Sistema reported on Nov. 4 it had obtained the first draft of Moscow&apos;s peace offer to Kyiv, issued days after the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war against Ukraine. Moscow and Kyiv held unsuccessful talks in Belarus and Turkey in the early months of the full-scale war, with no direct negotiations having been taking part ever since. The six-page document, published by Sistema, had four pages of annexes and was dated March 7, 2022. Russian delegation handed it over to the Ukrainian side during the third round of talks in Belovezhskaya Pushcha in Belarus. Sistema received a draft from an unnamed Ukrainian source familiar with the talks, and a Russian source who confirmed its authenticity. The unilateral terms of the document apparently meant Kyiv&apos;s capitulation, the article read. The New York Times (NYT) in June published the 17-page purported draft in full dated April 15, 2022. Although it has similarities to the first draft, such as the lifting of all sanctions against Moscow, Russia softened its stance on other demands. In the initial document, dated March 7, Moscow demanded Ukraine to reduce its army to 50,000 people, five times less than the country had by 2022, as well as reduce the number of ships, helicopters, and tanks. Russia planned to ban Ukraine from developing &quot;any other types of weapons as a result of scientific research.&quot; According to the draft, Moscow demanded not to produce, acquire or deploy in Ukraine missile weapons &quot;of any type with a range of more than 250 km.&quot; Ukraine also reportedly should have confirmed the independence of the country&apos;s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, by then partly occupied by Russia, and rebuild the the regions&apos; infrastructure destroyed since following Russia&apos;s invasion. Among other things, Russia demanded to de facto legalize Soviet and communist symbols in Ukraine. Russian President Putin said in June 2024 that, as a condition for peace negotiations, Ukrainian troops must leave the country&apos;s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. He added that Ukraine must recognize Russia&apos;s annexation of the regions and abandon any ambition to join NATO. Kyiv rejected this demand. Ukraine said the peace talks should be held on the basis of its 10-step peace formula, which includes a full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-purported-draft-of-ukraine-russia-peace-treaty-from-2022/	2024-11-04T10:34:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1239006724.jpg
Opinion: Gogol, the Ukrainian Kafka that Russia couldn’t claim	The question of Nikolai Gogol&#x2019;s &#x201C;belonging&#x201D;&#x2014;especially now, as Ukrainian and Russian cultures, long bound by an imperial past, are severing their ties before our eyes&#x2014;remains a deeply painful issue for Ukrainians. Gogol, one of the most gifted writers ever born on Ukrainian soil, loved Ukraine profoundly as a civilization, was Ukrainian-speaking by origin, yet chose Russian as his language of expression, thereby enriching Russian literature, whose importance not only for Ukraine but also for the world many of us are now trying to deny. Yet literature is not a production line, and Ukrainians are not alone in grappling with such complex figures. French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, for instance, studied Franz Kafka not simply for his writing but for his unique position within world culture: a Jew from Prague, detached from Czech culture, fluent in German but distant from German civilization. Kafka constructed his own phantasmagorical universe&#x2026; Deleuze and Guattari applied the theories of French linguist Henri Gobard, who emphasized &#x201C;four languages&#x201D; that shape a writer&#x2019;s work&#x2014;the language of the land, the state, culture, and memory, or the &#x201C;mystical&#x201D; language. For Kafka, Czech was the language of his land, German the language of state and culture, and Hebrew his mystical language. This framework led Deleuze and Guattari to describe writing as &#x201C;minor literature&#x201D;&#x2014;not simply the literature of a national minority, but a distinct and otherworldly literature emerging within the same linguistic space. Kafka&#x2019;s German was not that of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe or Friedrich Schiller, although his works are written in the &#x201C;same&#x201D; language. Applying this lens to Gogol reveals something extraordinary. For him, Russian was the language of the state and culture, yet Ukrainian was simultaneously the language of his land and his mystical tongue&#x2014;the wellspring of his genius! From the start, Gogol was a &#x201C;minor literature&#x201D; writer, striving to transition into the &#x201C;major&#x201D; and &#x201C;universal&#x201D; literary world&#x2014;but, fortunately for us, he failed. Strangely, this perspective returns us to an imperial, rather than Soviet, view of Gogol. Russians once saw him as their classic, celebrated with a grand monument on Moscow&#x2019;s Gogolevsky Boulevard. But this was the Gogol of the Bolsheviks, a tool for &#x201C;social criticism&#x201D; and satire; this is why Joseph Stalin relegated his monument to a courtyard, closer to the writer&#x2019;s final resting place. Why, though, was there one Gogol in the Russian Empire and another in the Soviet Union? Early in his career, Gogol was viewed as a Ukrainian writer by Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;respectable public,&#x201D; which did not sit well with Nikolai Vasilyevich himself. Even when portraying Cossack loyalty in the novella &#x201C;Taras Bulba,&#x201D; he was accused of &#x201C;idealizing&#x201D; Ukraine. Gogol, failing to see the contempt some Russian peers held for his homeland, turned to write about Russia&#x2014;but here, too, he met failure. The quill pen with which Nikolai Gogol worked on the second part of his work &quot;Dead Souls.&quot; (Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images)It wasn&#x2019;t for lack of skill. &#x201C;The Government Inspector&#x201D; and &#x201C;Dead Souls&#x201D; are brilliant works. The problem lay in Gogol&#x2019;s desire to write a grand poem about Russia; instead, his genius produced unflinching satire. Only Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin matched his biting portrayal of Russia, but there was a difference: Saltykov, a &#x201C;Great Russian,&#x201D; did not idealize Ukraine, whereas Gogol, a &#x201C;Little Russian,&#x201D; had portrayed Ukraine beautifully and rendered Russia harshly. Gogol could not grasp the expectations of Russia&#x2019;s cultural elite, who reproached the writer for not creating an ideal portrait of Russia and denigrating Ukraine. His inability to meet his demand drove him to destroy the sequel of &#x201C;Dead Souls,&#x201D; which could not yield an idealized Russia either. Gogol could only respond through journalism, but here the democratic public, led by the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky, criticized his &#x201C;reactionary&#x201D; attitude. It was impossible to please both Belinsky&#x2019;s and Russia&#x2019;s cultural elite. No Russian writer would even attempt it! But Gogol was neither fully Russian nor could he ever become one. He was the &#x201C;Kafka&#x201D; of Russian literature&#x2014;a Ukrainian who cherished his homeland as a timeless myth, a dream, and yet viewed Russia, alien to him, with a realist&#x2019;s unflinching gaze. He wanted to see Russia as beautiful but found a monster instead. His Russian contemporaries could not abide this. They honored him with a monument that, like Gogol himself, would suffer forever&#x2014;because he could not excise the &#x201C;Little Russian&#x201D; within him and become a &#x201C;real Russian,&#x201D; who scorns Ukraine and finds beauty in Russia&#x2019;s grotesque figure. The Bolsheviks, of course, twisted Gogol&#x2019;s legacy, turning his &#x201C;Little Russian&#x201D; themes into mere folklore and his &#x201C;Great Russian&#x201D; themes into mere satire on the ruling classes. His portrayal of Russia was no longer seen as a Ukrainian&#x2019;s view but rather a Marxist critique of exploiters. Yet these distortions have little to do with the true legacy of this Ukrainian genius. Perhaps, then, we should recognize Gogol as a Ukrainian Kafka&#x2014;a poet of Ukraine and the creator of a phantasmagorical Russia racing toward an unknowable destination, a man who showed us the vile world of Nozdyov and Sobakevich&#x2014;a stark contrast to Ukraine&#x2019;s idyllic landscapes. We should heed not the &#x201C;revolutionary democrats&#x201D; or Stalin, but those of contemporaries of Gogol who, even in his lifetime, saw him as a Ukrainian writer when he wrote &#x201C;Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka&#x201D; and &#x201C;Dead Souls.&#x201D; Moreover, modern Russia is neither Stalin&#x2019;s Soviet Union nor the Russian Empire under Nicholas I. Today, it would neither let Gogol mythologize Ukraine nor permit him to &#x201C;vilify&#x201D; Russia. It would spit Gogol out entirely.

As Russian losses in Ukraine pass 700,000, the Kremlin runs low on non-mobilization options	Russian losses in Ukraine have passed the 700,000 mark, according to figures released by Kyiv on Nov. 4, just 77 days after they hit 600,000, according to the same source. According to Kyiv, casualty rates among Moscow&apos;s forces have surged in recent months &#x2014; October saw an average of 1,307 casualties daily. According to an analysis of the Ukrainian figures by analyst Ragnar Gudmundsson, six of the top ten bloodiest days for Moscow&apos;s forces since the launch of the full-scale invasion all occurred in October. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. They are broadly in line with estimates from Western nations. Yet, Russia&apos;s tactic of throwing men into what Ukrainian officials have called a &quot;meat grinder&quot; is working &#x2014; Moscow seized more territory in its war against Ukraine over the past week than at any point in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 1. With the losses growing, the situation becomes trickier for the Kremlin, which requires additional troops to continue the ongoing advances in Ukraine. While not disclosing its losses in Ukraine, the Russian Emergency Ministry on Nov. 2 published an updated manual on how to dig mass graves during wartime. &quot;Russian military authorities are trying to walk the line between the need for more troops because of the wasteful way they are fighting this war, and also not wanting to have a real mass mobilization,&quot; Dr. Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s tricky from a public relations point of view because they don&apos;t want to admit quite how dire things are, but nevertheless, they do still have to get more people in through the door to carry on with the war.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin announced mobilization for his full-scale war against Ukraine in September 2022, a move that proved highly unpopular and led to 261,000 people fleeing the country, according to reports. Since then, Putin has tried to avoid a second wave, instead relying on a variety of other methods to boost manpower. At the end of September, Putin signed a decree to draft 133,000 Russians between October and January as part of the regularly occurring fall conscription campaign. All healthy Russian men aged 18&#x2013;30 are eligible for conscription and, if drafted, must serve for one year. While on the face of it, this would appear to be a significant boost to Russia&apos;s manpower issues, the Kremlin is actually rather limited with what it can do with these men. More than 200,000 people have reported to service under partial mobilization in Moscow, Russia on Oct. 4, 2022. (Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Remains of russians soldiers are found in the Bakhmut battle zone, in Sloviansk, in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on June 29, 2024. (Pablo Miranzo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Conscription in Russia long predates the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is geared more toward maintaining a domestic military force in the event of Russia being invaded. As such, there is an understanding in the Russian society that they will not be expected to fight in combat zones abroad, and civil society groups consisting of the mothers of conscripts are one of the few movements in the country that the Kremlin tolerates and actually listens to. As such, in March 2022, Putin publicly stated that no conscripts would be sent to fight in Ukraine &#x2014; a statement that was proven false just one day later. Despite this, the Kremlin remains highly sensitive to the issue of using conscripts in Ukraine, and the majority of its fighting force has to rely on those who voluntarily sign contracts. One of the biggest motivators to get Russian men to sign up to fight in Ukraine is simply cold, hard cash, often targeting recruits from economically weaker regions or migrants. Putin on July 31 ordered an increase in the sign-on bonus for new military recruits to serve in Ukraine to 400,000 rubles (over $4,600). The presidential decree effectively doubled the lump-sum payment of 195,000 ($2,260) rubles initially promised to recruits in September 2022. However, some regions of Russia have implemented their own even higher rates. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov announced on Oct. 7 that residents there will be paid a nationwide record 3 million rubles (about $31,200). According to Russia&apos;s federal statistics service, Rosstat, the average monthly wage across the country, as reported in June 2023, was around 65,000 rubles ($735). &quot;It&apos;s clear that it&apos;s the money that&apos;s motivating people, but the question is then, what happens when you get to the end of that pool of people?&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Because there are some communities reportedly, where all of the able-bodied men have been taken for the military.&quot; According to Mathers, Russia will eventually have to start trying to lure men from more economically developed parts of the country, such as the big cities, at which point Putin could face unrest. &quot;Up to now, Putin has a deal with the Russian society &#x2014; these more prosperous sections of society are going to be pretty much isolated from real sacrifice,&quot; she said. &quot;At what point does that change?&quot; Then, there is the economic burden of paying out such large sums of money to such large amounts of people. Russia&apos;s industrial and private sectors are struggling to compete with such wage offers, and the country&apos;s labor force and production capacity were &quot;almost exhausted,&quot; Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said in July. One other area of recruitment may account for relatively small numbers of fighters but speaks to Russia&apos;s increasing desperation for manpower. Moscow has been recruiting convicts for its war against Ukraine since summer 2022, first under the auspices of the Wagner mercenary company and then directly under the Russian Defense Ministry. In an indication that this pool was drying up, Putin signed a law on Oct. 2 that exempts defendants from criminal liability if they join the Russian army. A source told the Russian independent investigative project IStories that about 100 people from each Russian detention center are planned to be sent to the war in Ukraine. There are currently 210 pre-trial detention centers in Russia, so about 20,000 people may be sent to serve, the media outlet said. And, of course, no discussion about Russia&apos;s manpower would be complete without mentioning its latest recruits &#x2014; North Korean soldiers. Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31. And on Nov. 4, Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said the first of them had come under fire from Ukrainian forces. &quot;The disclosure that North Korean troops may appear on the front line is a direct consequence of catastrophic Russian casualties,&quot; John Foreman, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent last month shortly before their reported deployment.

(Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)&quot;Their military effectiveness is questionable, and they will be cannon fodder for Ukrainian defenders.&quot; But according to reports, all of Russia&apos;s efforts short of another wave of mobilization aren&apos;t enough to provide its army with the manpower it needs. Regional officials were unable to meet more than a third of their conscription quotas on average, Bloomberg reported on Aug. 13, citing two anonymous sources that said it could force Russia to consider a new mobilization. Of course, Ukraine is also facing its own manpower and mobilization issues &#x2014; Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee, stated on Nov. 2 that in his view it is necessary to mobilize 500,000 citizens, given current battlefield conditions. And despite the surge in Russian losses, battlefield conditions are, in the words of one expert who spoke to the Kyiv Independent last week, &quot;pretty grim for the Ukrainians.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/as-russian-losses-in-ukraine-pass-700-000-the-kremlin-runs-low-on-non-mobilization-options/	2024-11-04T09:14:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1243747572.jpg
Canada sends first NASAMS system to Ukraine	Canada sent the first U.S.-made National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) to Ukraine, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told President Volodymyr Zelensky on Nov. 4. &quot;We expect to receive it by the end of this year,&quot; Zelensky said after the call. Trudeau announced in January 2023 that the country would purchase the $406 million NASAMS for Kyiv. Ottawa reportedly paid for the system later in the spring, but its delivery has been delayed. Earlier in the day, Zelensky said that Ukraine has begun receiving increasingly more military assistance from partners, namely in terms of artillery. The NASAMS systems have been in service with Ukrainian forces since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid the escalating Russian airstrikes. Ukraine has lobbied international partners for more air defense capabilities in the wake of intensifying Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure. Canada has committed 4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.2 billion) in military aid for Kyiv since the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-sends-nasams-system-to-ukraine/	2024-11-04T09:11:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1246674467.jpg
Russia launches nearly 10 times more Shahed drones year to year, Zelensky says	Russian forces are launching about ten times as many Shahed-type drones against Ukraine as they did last fall, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 4. Moscow has ramped up drone strikes on Kyiv and the rest of the country, while decreasing the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. Russia launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine in October, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. &quot;We must fully counter them,&quot; Zelensky said following the meeting with top Ukrainian officials earlier in the day. Anatolii Kryvonozhko, acting Air Force commander, briefed the president on countering Russian aerial attacks, strengthening air defense and mobile fire groups, and developing new solutions to combat guided bombs. According to authorities, Russian drones came in waves and flew low, likely trying to spot weaknesses in Ukraine&apos;s air defense. Over the past week, Russia attacked Ukraine with over 900 guided aerial bombs, almost 500 Shahed drones, and around 30 missiles, Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-nearly-10-times-more-shahed-drones-than-last-fall-zelensky-says/	2024-11-04T08:10:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180281680.jpg
Russia grants citizenship to over 3,300 foreigners under Putin's military decree	A total of 3,344 foreigners have been granted Russian citizenship since the beginning of 2024 under one of Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s decrees, Irina Volk, a representative for the Russian Interior Ministry, claimed on Nov. 4. Putin signed in January a decree allowing foreigners who have served a year under contract in the Russian army, as well as their close relatives, to obtain Russian citizenship under a simplified procedure. According to the document, the mandatory knowledge of the Russian language, Russian history and legislation are excluded. Volk did not specify whether the figure includes only mercenaries or their family members as well. Since the start of the all-out war, Moscow has been recruiting foreigners from Nepal, Somalia, India, Cuba, and other countries to fight against Ukraine. In August, Putin signed a decree allowing foreigners and stateless persons to apply for temporary residence in Russia on &quot;moral grounds.&quot; Another decree made it easier for all Ukrainian residents to acquire Russian citizenship, a move condemned by Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-grants-citizenship-to-over-3-300-foreign-mercenaries-under-putins-decree/	2024-11-04T07:08:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2061699637.jpg
Ukraine open to Qatar mediating energy security with Russia but denies direct talks	Ukraine is not holding direct talks with Russia on an energy ceasefire but is open to a third country mediating the implementation of the peace formula talks, said Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, in a televised interview on Nov. 4. The official said this in response to multiple media publications that claimed Kyiv and Moscow are holding preliminary discussions on mutually stopping strikes on energy facilities. After the Qatar-mediated talks allegedly first fell through in August in the wake of the Kursk incursion, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29 that the parties are considering resuming the discussions. The Kremlin denied the resumption of talks in a statement on Oct. 30. Speaking in Montreal, Canada, Yermak refuted any direct negotiations with Moscow. He added that a thematic international conference, co-organized by Qatar, on implementing the security aspect of Ukraine&apos;s peace formula took place online in August without Russian participation. The official said that Kyiv would not rule out the possibility of reaching an agreement based on the thematic conference through intermediaries, naming Qatar or &quot;any other country&quot; that would help the parties implement the conclusions. &quot;After that, we said that if today, Qatar or any other country is ready to implement these agreements separately with Ukraine and separately with Russia, please do,&quot; Yermak said. The third point of Ukraine&apos;s peace formula denounces Russian strikes against the Ukrainian energy grid and urges tougher sanctions to undermine Moscow&apos;s capability to sustain these attacks. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the idea of a mutual cessation of energy strikes to implement this goal was proposed during the first global peace summit in Switzerland in June. He said that a willingness on Russia&#x2019;s part to halt the strikes might signal a willingness to start broader peace talks. An agreement would mark the most significant de-escalation of the war since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Ukraine is bracing for its toughest winter yet, with half of its energy infrastructure in ruins after Russia launched massive campaigns against the country&apos;s energy grid in the autumn-winter period of 2023-2023 and again in the spring of 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-russia-qatar-energy-security/	2024-11-04T05:54:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/ffacfaa7983e7e7df4c60c3a62791069_1714407581_extra_large.jpeg
63% of Ukrainians ready to endure the war as long as necessary, survey shows	Almost two-thirds of Ukrainians said they are ready to endure the war as long as it takes, a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) showed on Nov. 4. A further 15% of respondents said they were willing to bear the burden of the war for a few more months, and 4% said they could endure it for six months. Some 6% percent said they are ready to endure for a year, and 12% could not answer. According to the poll, positions on the matter have remained mostly stable since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022. However, there was a slight drop in those willing to endure the war for as long as needed&#x2013;from 73% in December 2023 and February 2024 to 63% in October. The number of those who supported continuing the resistance only for a shorter period of time has also grown. This trend was especially noticeable in the south and east, where the share of respondents willing to endure the war for a year or more went from 71% to 57% and 73% to 48%, respectively. The population of western and central Ukraine expressed high support and confidence regarding the resistance. The poll was conducted between Sept. 20 and Oct. 3. on a representative sample of 989 people. It excluded those who fled abroad or lived in the Russian-occupied territories. Ukraine finds itself in an increasingly difficult situation in the war. Russian forces keep advancing in the east at a pace unseen in 2024 while the country braces for renewed strikes on the energy grid and possible blackouts during winter. A potential return of ex-President Donald Trump to the White House after the U.S. election on Nov. 5 also casts a shadow on the future of allied support for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/63-percent-of-ukrainians-ready-to-endure-the-war-as-long-as-necessary-survey-shows/	2024-11-04T04:51:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1244707924.jpg
Artillery supplies from partners for Ukraine have increased, Zelensky says	Ukraine has begun receiving increasingly more military assistance from international partners, namely artillery shells, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 4. &quot;We are recording an increased supply of defense aid packages. The situation with artillery has improved,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram after a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&apos;s Staff. The statement comes several days after Zelensky complained that Kyiv had received only close to 10% of military assistance approved by U.S. Congress in April. The U.S. has recently announced several large-scale aid packages for Ukraine, most recently $425 million worth of ammunition, arms, vehicles, and other support unveiled on Nov. 1. The Pentagon seeks to ship in defense aid before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office in January. There are fears that if Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump defeats his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the Nov. 5 election, Washington might scale down its support for Kyiv. Ukraine finds itself in an increasingly difficult situation on the battlefield, facing shortages not only in materiel but also in manpower as the mobilization drive stalls. Speaking after the meeting, Zelensky was briefed on the &quot;destruction of Russian forces&quot; near the Ukrainian border in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The president also discussed drone supplies for the military with Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, saying that the &quot;approved supply plans are being carried out.&quot; &quot;I instructed the defense minister to increase orders of Ukrainian drones further,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/artillery-supplies-from-partners-for-ukraine-have-increased-zelensky-says/	2024-11-04T04:01:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Zelensky-and-Syrskyi-Nov-4.jpg
Former UK PM Johnson optimistic about Ukraine support if Trump wins	Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson thinks it is hard to imagine that Donald Trump would begin his presidency by abandoning Ukraine, Johnson said in an interview with CNN on Nov. 4. &quot;I cannot believe that a guy who is so passionate about his country&#x2026; would want to kick off his presidency by basically allowing the Soviet Empire to be great again,&quot; Boris Johnson said in reference to Trump&apos;s &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; motto. Russia has been making gains on the battlefield at a pace unseen in 2024. The lack of manpower and materiel exhausted Kyiv&#x2019;s troops, who are holding back one of Russia&apos;s &quot;most powerful&quot; offensives since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war. Despite Johnson&apos;s statement, there are concerns that if Trump returns to the White House after the election on Nov. 5, the U.S. could withdraw its crucial support or push Ukraine toward painful concessions. Speaking to CNN, Johnson pointed out that it was during Trump&apos;s presidency when Ukraine received Javelin anti-tank weapons as the country fought Russian proxy forces in the Donbas region. Trump, the U.S. president between 2017 and 2021, greenlighted the supply of Javelin launchers to Ukraine, a policy shift from his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Johnson, who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom from 2019 to 2022, boasted close ties with then-U.S. President Trump. He also said that whoever wins the U.S. election on Nov. 5 will have to ramp up support for Ukraine. &quot;Just by going forward with the current policy that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris (followed) is not enough,&quot; the former British prime minister said. The Biden administration has committed $64 billion in military aid to Ukraine since 2022, making Washington the leading defense donor to Kyiv. However, critics have called out the president&apos;s supposedly cumbersome and piecemeal strategy in supporting Ukraine. &quot;Even if Kamala wins&#x2026; with the current trajectory, that is not enough,&quot; Johnson added. Recent polls show that Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who has pledged to continue supporting Ukraine if elected, are going into the home stretch neck-and-neck. Extending NATO membership to Ukraine is the only solution, and it has to be done, as it is the only long-term solution that provides peace and stability, the former U.K. prime minister added.	https://kyivindependent.com/boris-johnson-on-trump/	2024-11-04T03:39:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1170765144.jpg
Russia to launch 2 Iranian satellites on Nov. 5, Iran's ambassador says	Russia will launch two Iranian satellites, Kowsar and Hodhod, into orbit on Nov. 5 using a Soyuz launcher, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali said on Nov. 4. &quot;In continuation of the development of scientific and technological cooperation between Iran and Russia, two Iranian satellites, Kowsar and Hodhow, will be launched into 500-kilometer orbit on Tuesday, Nov. (5), at 2:48 Tehran time by a Soyuz launcher, Jalali said on X. The delivery of the two satellites to Russia was reported on Oct. 12, underscoring the deepening cooperation of the two Western-sanctioned countries. Kowsar, a high-resolution imaging satellite, is designed for agricultural use, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Hodhod, a small communications satellite, aims to provide satellite-based connectivity in remote areas with limited terrestrial networks. Russia previously launched Iranian satellites into orbit in February and again in 2022, raising concerns from U.S. officials about the potential military implications. These officials worry that the satellites could support Russia&apos;s operations in Ukraine and help Iran monitor military targets across Israel and the Middle East. The ties between Moscow and Tehran deepened since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. Iran has provided Russia with thousands of Shahed drones used in attacks against Ukraine and even close-range ballistic missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-launch-2-iranian-satellites-on-nov-5-irans-ambassador-says/	2024-11-04T02:54:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1241357589.jpg
Russian attacks injure at least 28 over past day across Ukraine	Russian attacks across Ukraine injured at least 28 civilians over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 4. Moscow launched 80 Shaheds and other drones overnight. Ukrainian air defenses shot 50 of them while 27 were &quot;lost,&quot; the Air Force said. Russia attacked a residential neighborhood in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kharkiv with guided bombs on the evening of Nov. 3, injuring at least 15 people, local authorities reported. The attack damaged a supermarket, multistory apartment buildings, commercial facilities, and cars. Among the injured are four police officers. Another guided bomb hit a residential building in the village of Kivsharivka in Kharkiv Oblast. Rescuers saved three people trapped under the rubble. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured one person in Myrnohrad and another in Kurakhove, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Kherson Oblast, the Russian military targeted educational and medical institutions, damaging three high-rise buildings and 19 private houses and injuring four people, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. Russia also launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile from Rostov Oblast, attacking the Dnipro district in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, damaging infrastructure and causing fire. There were no casualties, Governor Serhii Lysak said on his Telegram channel. Two men were injured as a result of a Russian strike on a firefighter building in the city of Odesa, Governor Oleh Kiper reported on his Telegram channel.&#x200C;&#x200C; A 55-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man were injured as a result of a Russian attack in the Polohy district, Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov said on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-nov-4/	2024-11-04T02:16:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-04_08-46-43.jpg
Russia distributes manual for digging mass graves to soldiers	The Russian Emergency Ministry on Nov. 2 published an updated manual on how to dig mass graves during wartime. The instructions have been reportedly distributed among Russian troops as Moscow&apos;s losses in Ukraine have&#x2013;according to Kyiv&#x2013;crossed 700,000 dead and wounded as of Nov. 4. The manual contains instructions and illustrations on how to dig graves up to the size of 100 corpses. Such a grave must be 20 meters long, three meters wide, and 2.3 meters high and requires 368.5 man-hours, the document says. The textbook also specifies circumstances under which it is allowed to cremate the dead and how to minimize chemical, biological, or radiological contamination. The first version of the manual was published in 2021, one year before Russia launched its full-scale war. It contained instructions on how to dispose of a large number of dead in case of an attack. Russia&apos;s heavy losses in Ukraine have been connected to its &quot;mass wave&quot; infantry tactics, which overwhelm Ukrainian defenders at the cost of thousands of killed and wounded. To offset the casualties without instituting a full draft, Moscow has been offering higher financial rewards for military service and enlisted migrant workers and residents of poorer regions. Most recently, Russia&apos;s ally North Korea has dispatched around 10,000-12,000 troops in support of its war against Ukraine. Despite the staggering casualty rates, Russian forces have been advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east as Kyiv faces one of the &quot;most powerful&quot; offensives since the start of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-distributes-manual-for-digging-mass-graves-to-soldiers/	2024-11-04T01:38:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2159525304.jpg
EU's Borrell asks South Korea to 'set up' aid to Ukraine	Josep Borrell, the top EU diplomat, visited South Korea on Nov. 4 amid rising concerns over North Korean troops joining Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. &quot;Russia&#x2019;s aggression against Ukraine is an existential threat. The Republic of Korea is best positioned to understand it,&quot; Borrell said on X after meeting South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun. &quot;We are united in our support to Ukraine. I encouraged them to step it up.&quot; The deepening cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang has sparked discussions in Seoul on revising its stance on military supplies for Ukraine. North Korea is believed to have dispatched 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia to join the war against Ukraine. Some 8,000 soldiers have been reportedly deployed in Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region partially held by Ukrainian forces. South Korea has provided Ukraine with humanitarian aid but not with lethal assistance, as the country&apos;s legislation prevents direct arms supplies to war zones. According to some media reports, South Korea has provided Ukraine with artillery shells indirectly via the U.S., but direct supplies of 155 mm rounds are currently not on the table. During his visit, Borrell visited the fortified Demilitarized Zone dividing South Korea and North Korea. The European diplomat said he aims to raise the cooperation between the EU and Seoul to &quot;the next level.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eus-borrell-asks-south-korea-to-increase-aid-to-ukraine/	2024-11-04T01:11:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Borrell-in-South-Korea.jpeg
German Foreign Minister Baerbock arrives in Kyiv	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived in Kyiv on Nov. 4 in a show of support for the besieged country, marking her eighth visit to Ukraine. &quot;We are countering this brutality with our humanity and support, so that Ukrainians can not only survive the winter, but so that their country can survive,&quot; Baerbock said upon arrival, according to Reuters. The German minister is expected to meet her Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, and President Volodymyr Zelensky. Her visit comes as Ukraine braces for what may be the harshest winter of the war yet. The Ukrainian energy grid was badly damaged during Russia&apos;s massive aerial campaigns in the autumn-winter period of 2022-23 and in the spring and summer of 2024. Fresh attacks against infrastructure are expected as temperatures drop. Germany has played a key role in providing energy support to Ukraine and bolstering the country&apos;s air defenses needed to repel further attacks. According to Baerbock, Berlin has committed an additional 170 million euros ($185 million) to boost Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-foreign-minister-baerbock/	2024-11-04T00:04:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1615972632-1.jpeg
North Korea receiving cash, food, space technology from Russia in return for soldiers, South Korean lawmaker says	North Korea is believed to receive cash, food, and space technology from Russia as compensation for entering the war on its side, The Korea Herald newspaper reported on Nov. 3, citing a lawmaker familiar with the matter. North Korea has reportedly dispatched 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia, with the first soldiers allegedly already coming under fire in Kursk Oblast. North Korean soldiers are believed to receive $2,000 per month for their service from Russia, adding up to a total of at least $200 million annually if calculated by 10,000 soldiers, Wi Sung-lac, a member of the South Korean parliamentary intelligence committee, told The Korea Herald. Moscow is also believed to have helped ease North Korea&#x2019;s food shortage, the lawmaker said, citing intelligence briefings. &quot;The 4 million tons of grains that North Korea says it produces per year are actually about 1 million tons short of what it needs to feed the country. If Russia is offering 600,000 to 700,000 tons of rice, that is enough to cover more than half of what North Korea would need to meet the year&apos;s demand,&quot; the lawmaker was quoted as saying by the Herald. According to The Korea Herald, South Korean intelligence believes that Russia is also helping North Korea with advanced space technology, enabling Pyongyang to launch another military reconnaissance satellite. Moscow plans to form at least five 2,000-3,000-strong units manned by North Korean troops, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.N., Sergiy Kyslytsya, said on Oct. 30. They would be equipped with Russian uniforms and arms and integrated into formations with ethnic minorities from Russia&apos;s Far East regions to conceal their presence. Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-russia-troops/	2024-11-03T23:27:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
First North Korean troops come under fire in Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian official claims	The first North Korean soldiers stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to aid Moscow&apos;s war have come under fire, Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, reported on Nov. 4. The official did not provide any more details on the circumstances of the engagement or possible losses on the North Korean side. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31. The Russian border region has seen heavy battles since Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive in early August. Moscow has deployed North Korean troops in Kursk Oblast to reinforce the defenses there while its most experienced units continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are gathering. Recently, Kyiv has been issuing warnings that the deployment of North Korean troops in combat is only a matter of days. Ukraine believes that Russia is preparing to send 12,000 North Korean soldiers to join its war, including special forces. According to Zelensky, Russia has confirmed to the West the involvement of Pyongyang&apos;s forces in the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/first-north-korean-troops-under-fire/	2024-11-03T22:36:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg

Finland closes world's last Lenin museum outside Russia	The Lenin Museum in Tampere, Finland&#x2014;the only museum outside Russia dedicated to Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin&#x2014;closed officially on Nov. 3. A new political museum at the same site will open on Feb. 15, 2025, Finnish authorities announced. The museum will reportedly focus on Finnish-Russian relations. The Lenin Museum was founded in 1946, becoming the first permanent Lenin exhibition located outside Russia. It is housed in the building where Lenin first met Joseph Stalin during a secret Bolshevik meeting. The exhibitions told the story of Lenin&apos;s life along with the history of Finnish-Soviet relations. Museum director Kalle Kallio told AFP that the institution&apos;s name had &quot;become a burden&quot; following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The name was off-putting to visitors, though Kallio clarified the museum has no connections to the Russian state. The forthcoming museum will be called &quot;Nootti&quot; (&quot;Note&quot;) and will include information on how Finland&apos;s relationship with Russia has evolved in the 21st century. Relations between Finland and Russia have deteriorated since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. In response to the war, Finland joined NATO in April 2023, extending the NATO-Russian border by roughly 1,340 kilometers (830 miles).	https://kyivindependent.com/finland-closes-worlds-last-lenin-museum-outside-russia/	2024-11-03T21:29:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-127968623.jpg
UN secretary general 'very concerned' about reports of North Korean troops in Russia	United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is &quot;very concerned&quot; about reports that North Korean troops are currently in Russia, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for Guterres, said in a statement issued Nov. 3. The statement follows recent reports that 8,000 North Korean troops are amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and preparing to enter combat alongside Russian forces. &quot;The Secretary-General is very concerned about reports of troops from the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea (North Korea) being sent to the Russian Federation, including their possible deployment to the conflict zone,&quot; the statement read. &quot;This would represent a very dangerous escalation of the war in Ukraine. Everything must be done to avoid any internationalization of this conflict.&quot; The statement did not confirm reports of North Korean troop activity in Russia, nor did it mention how military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang would be interpreted under the U.N. Charter or current Security Council resolutions. Ukraine and the United States have accused Russia of violating the U.N. charter by involving Pyongyang in the war, due to existing restrictions on North Korea. According to the statement, Guterres supports &quot;all meaningful efforts towards a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in Ukraine.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky on Nov. 1 issued an urgent warning to the international community regarding North Korea, calling on allies to stop &quot;just watching&quot; as the threat from Pyongyang escalates. He has repeatedly appealed to both China and the West to move beyond words and into action. Guterres garnered criticism from Ukraine when he visited Russia in October to participate in the BRICS summit, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky reportedly then rejected Guterres&apos; attempt to visit Ukraine due to his participation in the summit. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/un-secretary-general-very-concerned-about-reports-of-north-korean-troops-in-russia/	2024-11-03T20:09:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1252540171.jpeg
Sandu wins in Moldova despite 'unprecedented' Russian interference	In a victory for pro-EU factions in Moldova and beyond, incumbent President Maia Sandu defeated her challenger, Alexandr Stoianoglo, in the country&apos;s Nov. 3 presidential runoff. Sandu won on Nov. 3 by a margin of about 54% to 45%, with 99% of votes counted. &quot;We proved that by uniting we can defeat those who wanted to bring us to our knees,&quot; Sandu told reporters in Chisinau in the early hours of Nov. 4. She wasn&apos;t just talking about Stoianoglo. Sandu has long insisted that the real opponent to her government and Moldova&apos;s European path is the Kremlin, which has been waging a hybrid war designed to push Chisinau back into Moscow&apos;s orbit. In what Sandu described &quot;a fraud of unprecedented proportions,&quot; Russia allegedly had its hand in a massive effort to influence Moldova&apos;s elections, aiming to unseat Sandu and quash the nation&apos;s EU aspirations. While her victory on Nov. 3 was decisive, it wasn&apos;t assured. Sandu&apos;s failure to secure a majority in the first round of voting on Oct. 20 came as a shock to many. In the same vote, Moldova&apos;s referendum on enshrining the country&apos;s EU accession path to the constitution won by only 11,000 votes. The president advanced to the November runoff as accusations of electoral fraud &#x2014; and doubts about Sandu&apos;s ability to stay in power &#x2013; mounted. &quot;We fought fairly in an unfair fight&#x2014;and we won,&quot; Sandu said after the Oct. 20 elections. &quot;But the fight isn&apos; t over.&quot; Opinion polls leading up to the Oct. 20 referendum showed that a majority of Moldovans supported the constitutional amendment on the country&apos;s path to the EU. When the amendment passed by the slimmest of margins, Sandu and others sounded the alarm on Russian interference. Moldovan authorities, independent observers, and officials from the EU and U.S. cited a malign influence campaign involving criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Moldovan lawmakers claimed that Moscow spent millions of dollars backing Stoianoglo, a former top prosecutor supported by the pro-Kremlin Party of Socialists. Over $15 million in Russian funds have reportedly been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to cast their ballots in the election. Pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, was accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network. Sandu said in a press conference ahead of the referendum that up to 300,000 votes were linked to the bribery scheme. Prior to the November runoff, a Moldovan government source said that Moscow might target polling stations abroad with disruptive tactics, including bomb threats, in an attempt to suppress the staunchly pro-EU expatriate vote. Stanislav Secrieru, Sandu&apos;s national security adviser, said that the presidential runoff was characterized by &quot;massive interference,&quot; including bomb threats, cyberattacks, and coordinated voter transport in the Russian-occupied Transnistria region. &quot;We&apos;re seeing massive interference by Russia in our electoral process as Moldovans vote in the presidential runoff today&#x2014;an effort with high potential to distort the outcome,&quot; Secrieru said on X. Secrieru posted photos and videos reportedly showing organized voter transport efforts and a voucher for a free restaurant meal offered to Moldovan diaspora voters in Moscow, among other evidence of disruption. When Sandu won by a clear margin despite &quot;unprecedented interference,&quot; Secrieru declared it a triumph for democracy. &quot;Moldovans made their voices heard loud and clear. ... Democracy has prevailed.&quot; A coupon for a restaurant meal, allegedly offered to Moldovan voters living in Moscow on election day. (Stanislav Secrieru / X)Sandu v. Moscow This election is not the first time Sandu has accused the Kremlin of attempting to oust her from power. While Russia has long sought to influence Moldova, Moscow&apos;s pressure on the country increased after the election of pro-Western Sandu in 2020. In Feb. 2023, Sandu said that Russia was planning to overthrow the government of Moldova under the guise of seemingly organic protests that would then turn violent. The plot was prevented, but the situation was &quot;really dramatic.&quot; Sandu then alleged in October 2023 that Wagner Group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin was directly involved in the plot, which was part of a broader effort to destabilize Moldova. Russia aims &quot;to overturn the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power from Chisinau to an illegitimate one that would put (Moldova) at Russia&apos;s disposal to stop the European integration process,&quot; Sandu said. The Kremlin also hopes to use Moldova to support its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, she said. A leaked Russian government document reportedly lays out Moscow&apos;s 10-year plan for Moldova, a plan which envisions Russia gaining vast control over the country by 2030. Under the plan, Transnistria would remain a breakaway region and Russian troops would remain there. Russian media should be widely prevalent and the Russian language must gain official status. Sandu&apos;s latest victory is unlikely to curb the Kremlin&apos;s ambitions in Chisinau. As Georgia&apos;s recent parliamentary elections show, campaigns of fraud and intimidation can effectively reverse a country&apos;s progress away from Russia. For the moment, though, Sandu is grateful to celebrate the victory. &quot;Moldova, today you are victorious,&quot; she said on X. &quot;Together, we&#x2019;ve shown the strength of our unity, democracy, and commitment to a dignified future.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/sandu-wins-in-moldova-despite-russian-influence-campaign/	2024-11-03T19:16:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182085909.jpg
Worldwide majority supports Ukrainian victory over Russia, poll says	A majority of respondents in a global poll said they would prefer a Ukrainian victory in the war against Russia, the Economist reported on Nov. 3. In a survey conducted jointly with the polling firm Globescan, the Economist asked 30,000 people in 29 countries and one territory, Hong Kong, whether they would rather see Russia or Ukraine win the war. An average of 54% of those surveyed said they wanted a Ukrainian win, compared to only 20% who supported Russia. More people supported Ukraine over Russia in 25 of the 30 countries or territories polled. Popular support for Ukraine was strong even in countries that are not traditional allies of Kyiv. Respondents in Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Hong Kong were pro-Ukraine, despite their governments&apos; neutrality or support of the Kremlin. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has positioned himself as a neutral party and mediator between Kyiv and Moscow, joining China in backing a six-point peace plan that does not mention Ukraine&apos;s territorial integrity. South Africa has claimed neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war but continued to strengthen its economic and political ties with Moscow. The country is a member of the BRICS group alongside Russia, China, and others, and even carried out joint naval drills with the two countries last year. Public support for Ukraine&apos;s victory was strongest in the United States and South Korea. The surveyed countries in which people were more likely to support Russia include Egypt, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam. In the same poll, respondents in all five countries said they would prefer a Donald Trump win in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Respondents were polled in July and August of 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/worldwide-majority-supports-ukrainian-victory-over-russia-poll-says/	2024-11-03T16:55:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1238866537.jpg
Russia attacks supermarket in Kharkiv, injures 14	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked a residential neighborhood in the Shevchenkivskyi district of Kharkiv on the evening of Nov. 3, injuring at least 14 people, local authorities reported. The attack damaged a supermarket, multistory apartment buildings, commercial facilities, and cars. At least 14 people were wounded, including four police officers, Kharkiv regional police reported. Power lines in the area were also affected, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Rescue operations are ongoing at the attack site. The strike on the supermarket is the latest in a series of devastating attacks against densely-populated residential areas of Kharkiv in recent days. Russia on Nov. 1 targeted a Kharkiv police station with two S-400 missiles, killing a police officer and injuring 46 people. The previous night, an attack on an apartment building killed three people, including two children, and injured 35. A Russian bombing on Oct. 28 damaged the Derzhprom building (the State Industry Building), a historic landmark that has been under enhanced UNESCO protection since 2022. An overnight attack just hours later killed four people and destroyed several homes. The northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless Russian attacks for over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The recent escalation is part of a pattern of intensifying aerial strikes as the city gears up for winter.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-attacks-supermarket-in-kharkiv-injures-13/	2024-11-03T15:10:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/kharkivmarket1.jpg
Sandu defeats pro-Russian opponent in preliminary results of Moldovan election	The preliminary results of Moldova&apos;s run-off presidential election on Nov. 3 show pro-EU incumbent Maia Sandu winning over pro-Russian challenger Alexandr Stoianoglo. With over 96% of votes counted, Sandu leads Stoianoglo by approximately 53% to 46%, according to Moldova&apos;s election commission. Sandu failed to win a majority in the first round of voting on Oct. 20, paving the way for the Nov. 3 runoff. The election is a decisive moment for Moldova as the nation chooses between EU integration and Russian influence. In the same Oct. 20 vote, Moldovans backed a referendum on enshrining the country&apos;s EU accession to the constitution by a razor-thin margin. The close call drew accusations of election interference from Sandu and EU officials. Allegations of voter fraud and interference have been a focus of this election, with Russian-backed fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor accused of laundering more than $39 million and using the funds to disseminate propaganda and direct voters. Moldovan authorities are also investigating organized voter transport, potentially linked to flights and trips by bus from Russia and other countries, raising concerns about external influence. Sandu urged Moldovans to protect the country&apos;s independence through voting, calling on citizens to resist intimidation and defend their nation&apos;s pro-European path. Meanwhile, Stoianoglo has denied involvement in vote-buying or Kremlin connections, despite mounting scrutiny. The fraught electoral cycle follows shortly after the widely disputed parliamentary elections in Georgia, in which the country&apos;s ruling Georgian Dream party claimed to win a majority. Pro-European parties and international monitors have cast doubt on the integrity of the election.	https://kyivindependent.com/sandu-leads-over-russia-backed-opponent-in-presidential-election-run-off/	2024-11-03T14:25:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2153384608.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine facing one of Russia's 'most powerful' offensives since start of all-out war	Key developments on Nov.2-3: Ukrainian troops are holding back one of Russia&apos;s &quot;most powerful&quot; offensives since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 2. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. After a meeting with a delegation of the Czech Armed Forces, Syrskyi described the situation on the battlefield as difficult. &quot;Active hostilities that continue in certain areas require constant renewal of the resources of Ukrainian units,&quot; he said. Since the beginning of the day, 126 clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces have taken place along the front line, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Nov. 2. Russia continues to press forward on its offensives across the eastern front, primarily on the Toretsk, Kurakhove, and Pokrovsk axes in Donetsk Oblast, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw little by little. In recent weeks, the Ukrainian military warned that Russia is escalating its operations in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. In Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian forces liberated and &quot;cleared out&quot; in mid-October the village of Kruhliakivka, which Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) described as important for the defense of Kupiansk. In the meantime, Russian troops are reportedly attempting to establish crossings near the Oskil River to advance toward the city of Kupiansk. The reports came as Russia is planning to involve North Korean troops to aid its war effort, with more than 7,000 soldiers deployed near the Ukrainian border. In a recent interview, President Volodymyr Zelensky blasted Ukraine&apos;s partners &quot;zero&quot; response to deployment of North Korean troops for the war in Ukraine. He said that if Kyiv had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; where North Korean troops are gathering. Russia has armed North Korean troops deployed near the border with Ukraine with infantry weapons, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Nov. 2. According to HUR, North Korean soldiers received 60-mm mortars, AK-12 rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, Feniks anti-tank guided missiles, and hand-held anti-tank grenade launchers. They also reportedly received some night vision devices, thermal imagers, collimator sights, and binoculars. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, citing communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. Russia deployed more than 7,000 North Korean troops from Russia&apos;s Primorsky Krai to the Ukrainian border, the agency said. These numbers almost coincide with those of Washington&apos;s announced earlier this week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that some 8,000 North Korean troops are amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, HUR reported. Soldiers are reportedly currently undergoing training at five military camps in the Russian Far East. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Russian forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war. Locations of Ukrainian weapons systems were shown in recently updated images on Google&apos;s free online map, Google Maps, Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, reported on Nov. 3. After &quot;a public reaction,&quot; Google representatives contacted the Ukrainian side, and the company is already working on fixing the issue, Kovalenko said in a later update on social media. The official previously complained that his department had been trying to reach the U.S.-based corporation Google to fix the problem quickly but did not receive an immediate response. &quot;In the future, we will also talk about how to solve any (similar) problems quickly,&quot; Kovalenko added in the later post. He also said that &quot;the Russians are already actively sharing these pictures&quot; without revealing any further details about the images&apos; content. Russia attacked Ukraine with over 900 bombs, almost 500 Shahed drones, and around 30 missiles over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the morning of Nov. 3. Most of these strikes targeted civilian facilities and critical infrastructure, according to Zelensky. Zelensky said via his Telegram channel that such attacks would be &quot;impossible&quot; if allies provided Ukraine with sufficient long-range striking capabilities, imposed &quot;truly effective sanctions&quot; against Russia that would prevent it from importing critical components for the production of drones and missiles, and make political decisions &quot;that can destroy Russia&apos;s will to fight.&quot; &quot;Ukraine deserves the same reliable security as all our other partners in the free world,&quot; the Ukrainian president concluded. Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three people and wounded another 24, as well as destroyed and damaged multiple homes and infrastructure facilities in the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 3. The Thales Belgium manufacturer agreed with the Ukrainian defense industry on a joint production of missiles to counter drones, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Nov. 2. &quot;This cooperation will strengthen the Ukrainian defense industry and the protection of critical infrastructure from enemy drones,&quot; Smetanin said. In recent months, Russia has ramped up drone strikes, while reducing its use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. More than 2,000 strike drones were launched against Ukraine during October, the General Staff reported on Nov. 1, which breaks the previous record set in September by nearly 700. The two companies signed a memorandum of cooperation. The work between Kyiv and Brussels is expected to expand to technology transfer and production of missile components in the future, the minister added. Thales is reportedly the only company worldwide developing, manufacturing and supplying a complete rocket system, including fire control systems, weapons and ammunition. It is specialized in the field of air-to-ground 70mm rocket systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-facing-one-of-russias-most-powerful-offensives-since-start-of-all-out-war/	2024-11-03T12:42:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
Over 200 Russian drones shot down by US-funded mobile fire teams since January, US ambassador reports	U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said on Nov. 3 that the U.S. State Department has funded 800 mobile fire teams in Ukraine, which have shot down over 200 Russian drones since Jan. 2024. &#x201C;The mobile fire teams are saving lives with their successful work, protecting people and critical infrastructure being attacked by Russia,&#x201D; she wrote on X. The mobile fire teams, consisting of personnel from Ukraine&apos;s National Guard and State Border Guard Service, are funded by the U.S. Department of State&#x2019;s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Moscow has recently ramped up drone strikes, while dialing down the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. Russia has launched thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, 1,339 Shahed-type kamikaze drones targeted the country in September, 1,107 of which were shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare and flying into Russian or Belarusian airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-200-russian-drones-shot-down-by-us-funded-ukrainian-mobile-fire-teams-since-january/	2024-11-03T11:09:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Ukraine needs 500,000 more troops amid slowing mobilization, senior lawmaker says	Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee, stated on Nov. 2 that in his view it is necessary to mobilize 500,000 citizens, given current battlefield conditions. Speaking on the &quot;Pryamiy&quot; TV channel, he noted that mobilization rates dropped in September after an initially steady pace following the mobilization strengthening law in April. While the goal had been to draft 200,000, Kostenko believes this falls short, aligning with former Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny&#x2019;s earlier recommendation for 500,000 recruits. In December 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the military&apos;s proposal for large-scale mobilization, estimating it would cost Ukraine 500 billion hryvnias. Currently, plans are set to mobilize an additional 160,000 men, adding to the 1.05 million already serving. Ukraine has been struggling to mobilize enough soldiers for the front line to compensate for troop casualties and the need to rotate soldiers who have been fighting since the onset of the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-needs-500-000-more-troops-amid-slowing-mobilization-senior-lawmaker-says/	2024-11-03T09:28:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
Russia’s use of unidentified gas surges on the front line, Ukraine lacks detectors	Russia is increasingly deploying unidentified gas in its latest chemical warfare tactic against Ukrainian troops, who are losing ground across the hotspots of the eastern front line. Ukraine is currently unable to identify the majority of the gas used on the battlefield, compared to previous months when it could diagnose about half of the chemicals, according to Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk. Russian troops have used chemical agents banned in warfare as a psychological operation to sow panic among the Ukrainian forces, said Vlasiuk from the Support Forces&#x2019; Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Command, a branch of the army responsible for inspecting chemical warfare. Russian drones throw gas grenades into dugouts or trenches in a brutal tactic to force Ukrainian soldiers out into the open field, making them easy prey for drone or artillery attacks. Of the 323 recorded cases of Russia&apos;s chemical attacks in October, nearly all except 15 incidents were &quot;unidentified,&quot; Vlasiuk told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 28. The officer said that Ukraine struggled to identify the new types of gas because it lacked sophisticated high-end detector technology to diagnose beyond the few prototypes in its library. &#x201C;It is dangerous both for our troops and for Ukraine as a whole, which will not be able to prove anything at the international level,&#x201D; Vlasiuk said. Ukrainian servicemen take part in battlefield first aid training during a military exercise in Kharkiv Oblast on May 1, 2023. (Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)More detectors needed from Kyiv&#x2019;s Western alliesUkraine needs &#x201C;hundreds&#x201D; of complex detectors that cost $100,000 to $600,000 each to better identify what exactly is being used by Russian troops, according to the colonel. Kyiv also needs additional simpler ones already being used to identify whether there are &#x201C;dangerous chemicals,&#x201D; he said. The insufficient number of detectors to identify gas makes it harder for Ukraine to record what Russian troops are deploying, in what quantity and in which parts of the front line, Vlasiuk added. The colonel said gaining Western interest in providing these sophisticated detectors to Ukraine has proven difficult. Other resources seen as more crucial, such as ammunition, are usually considered the priority. Discussions are held at venues such as the Ramstein format meetings, also known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which are held nearly monthly, he added. The upcoming one, delayed last month, is scheduled for November in a virtual conference call format. Identifying chemical agents is &#x201C;very easy&#x201D; with the right detectors, according to Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former commanding officer of the U.K.&#x2019;s Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment. He estimated that Ukraine might need &#x201C;a few hundred&#x201D; hand-held detectors that cost roughly $10,000 to $50,000 each.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Detectors can help confirm war crimes and help treat troopsUkraine has recorded over 4,600 cases of Russian gas attacks on the battlefield since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022, according to Support Forces. Vlasiuk said the types of gas identified thus far are CS and CS tear gas, as well as ammonia and chloropicrin. Many more could have gone unrecorded, he added. The use of chemical agents, including tear gas &#x2013; even if not lethal &#x2013; on the battlefield is a violation of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, a post-Cold-War disarmament treaty that bans the use of chemical weapons in war and obliges countries to eliminate them. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a United Nations watchdog, says that tear gas is &#x201C;considered chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare.&#x201D; &#x201C;We can detect CS, but if the enemy uses something else more complex, newer, or a mix that is similar in composition but not CS, we can&apos;t identify it,&#x201D; Vlasiuk said, explaining that presenting evidence to Western allies and the OPCW is difficult. A graphic representing Russia&apos;s use of chemical agents against Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield. (Support Forces of Ukraine&apos;s General Staff)Ukraine&#x2019;s concerns for the new types of gas found on the battlefield come as Russian troops continue to thrust forward across the hotspots of the war in eastern Ukraine, increasingly capturing villages and towns. The Ukrainian defense remains stretched across the front line, with many of its soldiers exhausted after having fought for nearly three years with little break. Gathering evidence to record such incidents is especially difficult in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a bold cross-border incursion in August. A handful of soldiers deployed in the area told the Kyiv Independent that they had suffered gas attacks on their position in Kursk Oblast, including one who said he had suffered multiple a day. Colonel Vlasiuk said that he knew of one October incident in which five soldiers suffered light symptoms from a gas attack in Kursk Oblast, adding that the inspection team could not get there to gather evidence for confirmation. At least three soldiers died from Russia&#x2019;s gas attacks, and almost 2,100 soldiers sought medical care after such incidents, according to the Support Forces. Capturing an air sample on the battlefield is difficult since gas blows away in the wind, therefore other forms of evidence, such as fragments of suspected chemical weapons or contaminated clothing, may be more useful, according to Dan Kaszeta, a chemical weapons expert at the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank who served in the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. He explained that &#x201C;there is highly specialized equipment that could, in theory, analyze samples in the field, but this equipment is expensive and requires specialist training.&#x201D; &#x201C;Because of the size of the area of operations, even a very dedicated effort to field specialist detection equipment is unlikely to be lucky enough to have the right equipment at the right spot,&#x201D; Kaszeta told the Kyiv Independent. Understanding the unidentified gas deployed by Russian troops allows Ukraine to treat the symptoms better, Vlasiuk stressed. He said the symptoms were similar to the other confirmed types used on the battlefield. Commonly cited symptoms include nausea, vomiting, eye and skin irritations, excessive coughing, chest tightness, and suffocation.

(Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images)Russia not held accountable for use of chemical weaponsThe U.S. and the U.K. have confirmed Russia&#x2019;s deployment of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers, slapping sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s Radiological, chemical, and biological defense troops, their chief, Russian Defense Ministry scientific centers, and companies involved. But OPCW, which Vlasiuk says has &#x201C;nearly impossible&#x201D; requirements to present evidence, has not confirmed Russia&#x2019;s use of chemical weapons on the battlefield. OPCW said in May that Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of deploying chemical weapons, but &#x201C;the information provided to the Organization so far by both sides, together with the information available to the Secretariat, is insufficiently substantiated.&quot; On top of the equipment shortage that makes it difficult to gather evidence for Russia&#x2019;s gas usage on the battlefield, Ukraine says the intensity of the fighting makes it a further challenge. But the monthly count of Russia&#x2019;s use of gas grenades has decreased for now, with 10-20 cases recorded across the front line daily. Vlasiuk added that Moscow appears to be focusing their deployment on the hottest parts of the front line, primarily in the Pokrovsk sector but also in the Chasiv Yar and Kupiansk directions. While Russia&#x2019;s stock of Soviet-era K-51 grenades appears to be ending, more RG-Vo grenades &#x2013; first detected in December 2023 &#x2013; are being deployed, according to the officer. In what appears to be a Russian tactic to keep waging chemical warfare, Moscow continues to produce RG-Vo grenades, but the quantity is unclear, Vlasiuk said. &#x201C;Russian forces are using chemical weapons on an industrial scale,&#x201D; de Bretton-Gordon said, estimating that 30% of front-line Ukrainian troops have suffered chemical attacks. Vlasiuk claimed that &#x201C;all sites of chemical weapon production are known&#x201D; and that Ukraine has located about ten factories that are either related or directly producing them. &#x201C;They now produce and use (RG-Vo grenades) normally,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;What (Russia) can put inside is also unknown. So far, we don&#x2019;t have a way to find out.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-use-of-unidentified-gas-surges-on-the-front-line-ukraine-lacks-detectors/	2024-11-03T08:22:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152456898.jpg
Paramedic, ambulance driver injured in Russian shelling of Kherson Oblast village, governor says	Russian troops shelled the village of Bilozerka in Kherson Oblast, wounding a paramedic and an ambulance driver, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on Nov. 3. Kherson and other regional settlements on the west bank of the Dnipro River are subjected to daily Russian attacks as Russian troops remain in control over the river&#x2019;s east bank in Kherson Oblast. Both victims were outside at the time of the attack, and they suffered mine-explosive and craniocerebral injuries as well as concussions, according to Prokudin. The paramedic also received a shrapnel wound to the leg. The roof and windows of a medical facility and an ambulance were damaged in the shelling, the Kherson Oblast Military Administration said later via Telegram. The administration added that a house also sustained damages due to a direct hit by a projectile.	https://kyivindependent.com/paramedic-ambulance-driver-injured-in-russian-shelling-of-kherson-oblast-village-governor-says/	2024-11-03T07:55:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/ambulance_kherson.jpg
If Trump wins US presidential election, Europe 'cannot remain pro-war,' Orban says	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in a radio interview on Nov. 3, as cited by Hungarian news outlet Telex, that if Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidency, &quot;Europe cannot remain pro-war,&quot; supposedly referring to EU&apos;s defense assistance to Ukraine, which Orban has repeatedly criticized. According to Telex, Orban also said that Europe can not bear the burden of Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine alone, into which Europe was &quot;irresponsibly dragged&quot;, and Europeans will also have to &quot;adapt to the situation.&quot; Under Orban&apos;s leadership, Hungary has repeatedly blocked aid to Kyiv, pushed for negotiations with Moscow, and spouted Kremlin talking points. Orban is a long-standing ally of Trump, whose potential presidency of the U.S. has raised concerns about the fate of Washington&apos;s further defense assistance to Ukraine. Orban recently dismissed President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan, which calls for more long-range weapons and the permission to use them against Russian targets, as &quot;dangerous&quot; and said that the EU must &quot;switch to a peace strategy instead of a war strategy.&quot; In July, Orban embarked on a &quot;peace tour&quot; and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and Trump. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly claimed he could end Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 24 hours but failed to explain how he would do so. Orban is also preparing to deliver a significant policy concession to Trump, potentially allowing him to evade a $50 billion loan intended to support Ukraine amid its ongoing war with Russia, Politico reported on Oct. 14. Should Trump win the presidency in November, this move would enable him to reassure Republican voters that he would not provide additional financial assistance to Ukraine, according to Politico.	https://kyivindependent.com/if-trump-wins-us-presidential-election-europe-cannot-remain-pro-war-orban-says/	2024-11-03T07:14:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1143574041.jpg
‘Trump fundamentally doesn't care about Ukraine’ – Michael McFaul on US elections	On Nov. 5, U.S. voters will go to the polls in what could be the most consequential presidential election in living memory. Former U.S. President and Republican candidate Donald Trump, who regularly boasts of his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has criticized military and financial aid for Kyiv, and who many fear could attempt to dismantle both NATO and American democracy, has every chance of returning to office. Recent polls show that Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who has pledged to continue supporting Ukraine if elected, are going into the home stretch neck-and-neck. The Kyiv Independent sat down with Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, professor of international studies at Stanford University, and the co-founder of the Yermak-McFaul Expert Group on Russian Sanctions, to talk about the U.S. elections and what their outcome could mean for Ukraine, Russia, and the future of the rules-based world order. Director at the Freeman-Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), a professor at Stanford University, Ambassador Michael McFaul at a briefing in the President&apos;s Office on Sept. 8, 2023, in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Photo by Viktor Kovalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Head of the President&apos;s Office Andriy Yermak (R) and Director at the Freeman-Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), a professor at Stanford University, Ambassador Michael McFaul (L) speak at a briefing in the President&apos;s Office on Sept. 8, 2023, in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Photo by Viktor Kovalchuk/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The interview has been edited for length and clarity. The Kyiv Independent: We have the U.S. presidential elections just a few days away now with polls neck and neck. We have Russia making gains across the front line in Ukraine at an increasing rate, including with North Korean troops now. We have democracy in countries like Georgia on its last legs. How serious is this moment in history? Michael McFaul: At the end of the Cold War, you had a condition where there was one global superpower. That was the U.S. There was one set of ideas that almost the entire world, both elites and populations, were aspiring to. That was democracy, markets, and a commitment to what back then leaders called the liberal international order. Fast forward to today, all three of those things have changed. So, one, the U.S. is no longer the hegemonic power in the world. You have had the rise of powerful states, like China and Russia. Second, we now have an ideological division, it&apos;s autocrats versus democrats. And the autocratic alliance is China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and some of their surrogates like Hamas and Hezbollah. And the democratic world is the U.S., our NATO allies, our democratic allies in Asia, and our partners in countries like Ukraine, which is on the front line of this fight between autocrats and democrats. Third, we&apos;ve had the breakdown of that liberal international order. We don&apos;t have an agreement about what those rules are. When they were most grotesquely violated in Ukraine in 2022, well, I would go back to 2014, the international system didn&apos;t respond to say, to adhere to the rules of the game. Most countries voted against that, but a lot of them stood on the sidelines. They were neutral, countries like China. Now we saw this group of countries meeting in Kazan for the BRICS meeting. And to me, shockingly, there were many democracies and the head of the United Nations was at that meeting. That suggests to me that we no longer have a unified consensus about what the international rules of the game are. The Kyiv Independent: Turning to the election, if we try and imagine America&apos;s place in the world in a second Trump presidency, predictions vary wildly between someone who&apos;s a brutal isolationist who says a lot of things but still throws his weight around the world on one hand, and on the other hand, someone already actively planning to abandon and dismantle NATO, to side with authoritarians, and to open the world to a kind of free-for-all. How do you see his rhetoric and where do you think he is on that spectrum? Michael McFaul: I am deeply worried about a second Trump presidency, both because of what he might want to do intentionally and because of what his signaling of weakness might provoke unintentionally. When it comes to rhetoric versus reality I think we have to take him at his word. In his first term, he relied on traditional Republicans to fill his foreign policy team, people like (former Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo, (former) Secretary of Defense (James N.) Mattis, (former national security advisors) H.R. McMaster and John Bolton. We disagree about certain policies, but they were basically establishment national security folks. And they most certainly stopped Trump from doing some of the craziest things that he proposed &#x2013; pulling out of NATO being at the top of that list. What&apos;s going to be different this time around is none of those people are going to be in the Trump administration, he&apos;s disparaged all of them. Second, Trump didn&apos;t really know how the government ran when he won in 2016. You know, he was doing other things with his career. A lot of the inertia of the government with respect to national security issues just kept going, and in good ways. Trump hardly ever talked about supporting democracy or human rights or freedom abroad. He always supported autocrats, met with Putin, and sent love letters to Kim Jong-un. I can&apos;t think of a time that he met with opposition leaders from Iran, Belarus, China, or Russia. But during the Trump administration, budgets for democracy promotion actually went up, and Trump just wasn&apos;t paying attention to that. Now his team has figured out how it works, and they&apos;ll be paying attention and be more in line with what he wants to do. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and former U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on July 12, 2024. (Viktor Orban/X)Third, he will feel like he has an electoral mandate to do these crazier things. If he wins again, when it comes to things like NATO or our allies in Asia, he thinks that the American people support him in saying to Putin do whatever the hell you want. I think history shows that when we are strong, the United States of America, when we exhibit peace through strength, we have more peaceful outcomes. When we signal weakness, when we try to appease dictators, that&apos;s when bad things can happen. I think the first important thing to remember is that the Soviet Union and Russia have never attacked a NATO ally. Here in the U.S., there&apos;s a group of people who think NATO causes conflict. It&apos;s exactly the opposite. NATO has been a stabilizer and has provided peace. There&apos;s no doubt in my mind that when Ukraine joins NATO, that will be stabilizing. But if we&apos;re showing that we&apos;re no longer credibly committed to NATO, then we will tempt Putin to test our commitment. I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll try to roll his tanks into downtown Tallinn. But I do think he might test some kind of operation in one of the Baltic states, then pull back and see what happens. That will trigger a debate within NATO, and that will be highly destabilizing. The Kyiv Independent: How do you see Trump&apos;s claim of being able to bring the war to an end very quickly, if not in 24 hours, but very quickly, by just calling both sides and forcing them to the table? I know it seems ridiculous to talk about, but what would that three-way game look like? Michael McFaul: There&apos;s good news and bad news with regard to this scenario. The good news is, should Trump win and make that phone call, Putin &#x2013; because there is this ideological affinity between them &#x2013; might have an incentive to help Trump achieve that outcome if he rightly believes that a successful Donald Trump is in the long-term national interest of Russia as defined by Putin. There might be an incentive for him to help Trump look good because that&apos;ll help him achieve other objectives down the road. Having said that, I&apos;m not optimistic that Putin will do that for a couple of just very elementary reasons. One, rarely do wars end when one side is becoming weaker and the stronger side just agrees to stop fighting. Trump coming to power and signaling that he&apos;s going to reduce or eliminate assistance to Ukraine, that&apos;s going to embolden Putin. He&apos;s going to think my enemy is now weaker. That this is a time to go for more, not less.

(Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images)If you buy a map in Russia today, not only Crimea, but the four other (partially occupied) regions of Ukraine are now on the Russian map because Putin annexed them on paper. I just don&apos;t see a scenario under which he gives those territories up until he&apos;s stopped on the battlefield. Some crazy Russians say, well, yeah, we can get a peace agreement just as long as Ukraine withdraws from all of those territories (all of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts) then we&apos;ll be happy. That&apos;s not going to happen, so I just think it&apos;s a bit of a naive scheme. If Trump is rebuffed, would he then change his mind? That&apos;s what my Republican colleagues say. I hope that&apos;s true, but I fear they&apos;re wrong. I just fear that Trump fundamentally doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine. He fundamentally doesn&apos;t care about democracy or the international rules of the game, that annexing parts of other countries is a bad thing. He still fundamentally does care about his personal relationship with Putin; he&apos;s been very consistent in his support for Putin, his admiration for Putin. That has never, ever wavered. The Kyiv Independent: It&apos;s good that you brought up handing over even more territory. Just a reminder, we&apos;re talking about the city of Zaporizhzhia, 700,000 people, the city of Kherson, which was already occupied, another 300,000 people. Michael McFaul: You just made a really good point that I want to underscore, at least for people in the U.S. Americans and Europeans, I don&apos;t want to say all, but they almost reflexively, when they say land for peace, they never think about what you just pointed out, which is people for peace. Because those are not just uninhabited places. What we&apos;re talking about is handing over Ukrainians. And we know how the Russians are treating them. This is colonization. This is imperialism. This is a genocide that we&apos;re talking about as part of these swaps. It&apos;s not just land. These are human beings who are Ukrainian citizens.

(Photo by Bulent Kilic/AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: A lot of Ukrainians see a future Harris presidency as simply a continuation of the current existing policy: the policy of Ukraine given enough support to survive, but not being allowed to win. But after two and a half years, we have Ukrainian forces overstretched, dire manpower shortages that foreign aid can never make up for, and Russia advancing now faster than any time since early 2022. Could President Harris, once elected, be willing to change course and do something braver? Michael McFaul: I want to see those changes you describe. They&apos;ve been too incremental and too slow in providing assistance. They put too many constraints. They have not effectively enforced the sanctions regime that is in place that could reduce Putin&apos;s supplies of money and technology. There&apos;s just more to be done on all fronts. I hope a couple of things will happen. I hope that after the election, President Biden will finally make the right decision to eliminate constraints on the use of long-range fires. Doing that will not lead to World War III. That&apos;s Putin propaganda. We had this debate about Abrams tanks, Patriots (air defense systems) F-16. None of those weapon systems triggered the use of a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. I hope that President Biden will make that decision so that he doesn&apos;t hand that decision to President Harris, takes it off the table so that it&apos;s already a fait accompli. I think that would be very prudent. The second thing I hope President Biden will do is signal much more clearly America&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO. Now maybe he has to put some qualifications: after the war, after hostilities have ended. But I think it just needs to be automatic. Whenever hostilities end and wherever the borders are &#x2014; that&apos;s a decision for President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people &#x2014; but wherever it is, that is the day that Ukraine should become a member of NATO; that is the day that you make sure that there&apos;s not going to be a third invasion of Ukraine.

(Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images)About a President Harris: I know people around her, her national security advisor, Phil Gordon, is a friend of mine. He knows Europe well. He&apos;s a European specialist, and they&apos;ve taken a special interest in Ukraine. Vice President (Harris) on the campaign trail talks about her seven meetings with President Zelensky all the time. Those, I think, are good signs. I think the transition to a new Harris administration might be more like other transitions where you get new people with new ideas. And I hope that those people will be ones that understand the importance of defeating Putin&apos;s army in Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: Looking inside Russia now, what will it actually take for Putin to look at the situation and decide he can&apos;t continue this war? In Ukraine, people are quite skeptical of internal opposition to the regime having any real effect. Michael McFaul: Well, tragically, I don&apos;t see a scenario under which domestic politics inside Russia will lead to an end of the war. It&apos;s a dictatorship. But we have to admit &#x2014; and this is an argument I have with Russian opposition leaders all the time &#x2014; Putin&apos;s not fighting this war alone. This is not Putin&apos;s war. This is Russia&apos;s war. Millions and millions and millions of Russians support this barbarism. They&apos;re the ones doing the killing, the terrorist attacks against Ukrainians. They&apos;re the ones kidnapping Ukrainian children. And tragically, more people support the war today than they did at the beginning of the escalated invasion in 2022. And the oligarchs are not going to get together and tell them, hey, Vladimir, this war is bad for us too. They have their billions because Putin gave them permission to have them. We just have to help Ukrainian warriors stop or defeat the Russian invading army. It&apos;s just that simple. There&apos;s no roundabout. History doesn&apos;t repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes. And there are lots of instances where defeat in war leads to political change inside countries, including Russia back in 1917, and even the war in Afghanistan. So, to the Russian opposition &#x2013; you don&apos;t have very many effective means to do things inside Russia. The best thing that could happen for you is for Putin to lose this war. And so I would encourage you to speak more loudly about helping Ukrainians and their supporters in the West to achieve that fact. You can watch the video version of this interview on our YouTube channel: Hi, this is Francis Farrell, who spoke to Michael McFaul for this piece. Well, this is it, this is the moment that could make or break Ukraine&apos;s struggle for existence, independence, and freedom, and it will be decided by millions of people an ocean away from Ukraine. Whatever the result, the winter ahead is going to be a very dark and very unpredictable one, but none of that means we will stop our work for a second.

McFaul on Ukraine's future with Trump vs. Harris	Ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election, the Kyiv Independent sat down with U.S. academic and former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul to discuss what the future of U.S. politics for Ukraine looks like with both presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris	https://kyivindependent.com/mcfaul-on-ukraines-future-with-trump-vs-harris/	2024-11-03T05:35:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_7188.jpg
Locations of Ukrainian weapons systems revealed on Google Maps, official says	Locations of Ukrainian weapons systems were shown in recently updated images on Google&apos;s free online map, Google Maps, Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, reported on Nov. 3. After &quot;a public reaction,&quot; Google representatives contacted the Ukrainian side, and the company is already working on fixing the issue, Kovalenko said in a later update on social media. The official previously complained that his department had been trying to reach the U.S.-based corporation Google to fix the problem quickly but did not receive an immediate response. &quot;In the future, we will also talk about how to solve any (similar) problems quickly,&quot; Kovalenko added in the later post. He also said that &quot;the Russians are already actively sharing these pictures&quot; without revealing any further details about the images&apos; content.	https://kyivindependent.com/locations-of-ukrainian-weapons-systems-revealed-on-google-maps-official-says/	2024-11-03T05:09:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2176026145.jpg
Russia launched around 900 bombs, 500 Shahed drones and 30 missiles at Ukraine over past week, Zelensky says	Russia attacked Ukraine with over 900 bombs, almost 500 Shahed drones, and around 30 missiles over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the morning of Nov. 3. Most of these strikes targeted civilian facilities and critical infrastructure, according to Zelensky. Zelensky said via his Telegram channel that such attacks would be &quot;impossible&quot; if allies provided Ukraine with sufficient long-range striking capabilities, imposed &quot;truly effective sanctions&quot; against Russia that would prevent it from importing critical components for the production of drones and missiles, and make political decisions &quot;that can destroy Russia&apos;s will to fight.&quot; &quot;Ukraine deserves the same reliable security as all our other partners in the free world,&quot; the Ukrainian president concluded. Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three people and wounded another 24, as well as destroyed and damaged multiple homes and infrastructure facilities in the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launched-around-900-bombs-500-shahed-drones-and-30-missiles-at-ukraine-over-past-week-zelensky-says/	2024-11-03T02:38:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-02_07-32-28.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 3, injure 24 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed three people and wounded another 24 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 3. From 5:30 p.m. local time on Nov. 2 to the morning of Nov. 3, Russian forces launched at Ukraine a Kh-59/69 guided air missile and 96 attack drones of Shahed and other types, according to the Air Force. The missile and 66 drones were downed by Ukrainian forces, 27 drones disappeared from radars, and another drone flew to Belarus, the Air Force said on Telegram. &#xA0;As of 9 a.m. local time, two more drones were flying in the Ukrainian sky, with air defenses working, the Air Force added. The aerial targets were reportedly downed over the Kyiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Odesa, and Khmelnytskyi regions of Ukraine. Local authorities said debris caused fires and minor damages to multiple buildings in Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast. Two people were killed in Ivanopillia, and another person suffered injuries in Myrnohrad as a result of Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Facebook. Ten houses, two apartment buildings, an industrial building, and infrastructure were damaged, according to Filashkin. Russian attacks against Kherson and 16 other settlements in Kherson Oblast killed one person and wounded another 10, including three children, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. The attacks damaged 14 houses, five apartment buildings, educational institutions, a library, a church, a post office, and shops, Prokudin added. Russian troops hit infrastructure near Dnipro on Nov. 2, injuring eight people, including two children, according to Serhii Lysak, the regional governor. Russian artillery and drone strikes against other settlements in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast reportedly damaged an industrial enterprise, 11 houses, three farm buildings, a truck, a gas pipeline, and power lines. Russian forces dropped a guided aerial bomb on the front-line village of Preobrazhenka near Polohy in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, wounding a 55-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man, Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram on the morning of Nov. 3. Earlier Russian attacks against Zaporizhzhia Oblast damaged six houses and infrastructure facilities, according to Fedorov. A Russian drone strike near Vovchansk on the afternoon of Nov. 2 injured two male civilians aged 33 and 60, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Russian attacks against other regional settlements damaged a farm and an educational institution, according to Syniehubov. A Russian drone strike on Kyiv on Nov. 2, which caused a fire in a 16-story residential building and an office building, left an 82-year-old woman with shrapnel injuries to the head, local authorities reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-3-injure-24-over-past-day/	2024-11-03T01:55:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-03---10_48_42.png
General Staff: Russia has lost 699,090 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 699,090 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 3. This number includes 1,410 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,182 tanks, 18,523 troop-carrying armored fighting vehicles, 28,160 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,086 artillery systems, 1,244 multiple launch rocket systems, 994 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,187 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-699-090-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-03T00:18:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1243747572.jpg
Germany's new populist party pressures coalition talks with anti-Ukraine stance	Germany&apos;s new leftist populist party, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance &#x2013; Reason and Justice (BSW), is pressing mainstream parties to make significant concessions as they negotiate potential coalition agreements in three eastern states. The BSW&apos;s demands center on halting military aid to Ukraine, a move that risks fracturing Germany&apos;s strong support for Kyiv, according to Nov. 3 Reuters report. Launched in January, the BSW is the only party to oppose arming Ukraine besides the far-right AfD. Germany remains Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military supporter, however, the BSW&apos;s stance is challenging this pro-Ukraine consensus, particularly in states like Brandenburg, Thuringia, and Saxony, where the BSW recently achieved electoral success. BSW leader Sahra Wagenknecht, known for her Russia-friendly, NATO-skeptical positions, is pushing for any coalition partners to align with her party&#x2019;s anti-war stance. This approach has already seen results, with the Brandenburg branch of the Social Democrats (SPD) endorsing a joint statement with the BSW. The document reportedly included a message: &quot;The war will not be ended by further weapons deliveries,&quot; and expressed opposition to the possible deployment of U.S. long-range missiles in Germany. The statement has sparked backlash from Berlin and criticism within the SPD itself. Agnieszka Brugger, a senior lawmaker from the Greens&#x2014;currently a junior partner in Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s coalition&#x2014;rebuked the SPD&apos;s Brandenburg branch for cooperating with the BSW&apos;s position, according to Reuters. Brugger criticized the BSW&apos;s stance as &quot;cynical and populist,&quot; adding that &quot;anyone who talks about peace but means an end to support for Ukraine does not want real peace. Such a policy would jeopardise the security of our country and our allies.&quot; SPD Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter also condemned the language used by the Brandenburg branch, calling it &quot;unacceptable.&quot; Although Germany&#x2019;s state governments cannot directly influence foreign policy, the BSW&apos;s position highlights the growing complexities of public opinion on the Ukraine war. Recent surveys indicate waning public enthusiasm for supporting Ukraine, even as Russia advances on the battlefield and U.S. support remains uncertain ahead of the Nov. 5 election. The BSW&apos;s success appears to be invigorating the SPD&apos;s left-wing, traditionally sympathetic to Russia, according to political scientist Stefan Marschall from the University of Duesseldorf.	https://kyivindependent.com/germanys-new-populist-party-pressures-coalition-talks-with-anti-ukraine-stance/	2024-11-02T23:02:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239785882.jpg
Russia launches hours-long drone attack on Kyiv for second consecutive night	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched its latest overnight drone strike on Ukraine, targeting the capital in an attack that lasted over five hours, city officials reported on Nov. 3. Several waves of explosions were heard in Kyiv throughout the night. Debris from intercepted drones struck multiple city districts. In the city&#x2019;s Holosiivskyi and Desnianskyi districts, drone debris fell in open areas causing multiple fires. The fires were quickly localized, according to Kyiv City Military administration. Authorities reported no casualties or significant damage. Air defense downed all the drones targeting Kyiv, according to Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. The debris damaged road surfaces, a lighting pole, and electrical utility wires in the Shevchenkivskyi district. The blast wave shattered windows on the first and second floors of a dormitory and an adjacent university building, while also damaged several windows from the first to the ninth floors of a nearby office building. The Nov. 3 attack is part of an ongoing series of drone strikes by Russian forces on Ukraine&apos;s capital, targeting both civilian and military infrastructure. A night before, Russian drone strike on Kyiv caused a fire in a 16-story residential building and an office building, leaving an 82-year-old woman with shrapnel injuries to the head. The air raid alert in Ukraine&#x2019;s capital lasted more than 5 hours, with explosions reported in Kyiv and surrounding areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-hours-long-drone-attack-on-kyiv-for-second-consecutive-night/	2024-11-02T22:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-02-23_54_49.jpeg
Moldova says Russia intends to disrupt expatriate voting in Nov. 3 runoff, Reuters reports	Moldova has informed several EU countries that it suspects Russia will attempt to disrupt voting by Moldovan expatriates at overseas polling stations during the Nov. 3 presidential election runoff, according to a Moldovan government source. Pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu faces former prosecutor general Alexandr Stoianoglo, who has support from the traditionally pro-Russian Socialist Party, in a high-stakes second round. The source, who spoke anonymously to Reuters, indicated that polling stations in countries including Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, Romania, the U.S., and Britain may be targeted by Moscow with disruptive tactics, including bomb hoaxes. &quot;The goal is to interrupt the voting process during the (bomb threat) evacuation and check by the police. We kindly ask to apply procedures and protocols that do not interrupt the voting process,&quot; Moldova said in a message to a European official, as shown in a screenshot reviewed by Reuters. Moldova, a former Soviet republic that gained independence with the Soviet Union&apos;s breakup in 1991, has alternated between pro-Western and pro-Russian orientations over the years. The country accelerated its Western alignment after Russia&#x2019;s 2022 invasion of neighboring Ukraine. Law enforcement has accused Russian-backed fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor of meddling in Moldova&#x2019;s election, though Shor denies any wrongdoing. Moldovan voters residing in the West are largely seen as pro-European and more likely to back Sandu, who has advocated for Moldova&#x2019;s bid to join the European Union by 2030. The diaspora vote played a crucial role in helping Sandu&#x2019;s team secure victory in the October 20 referendum, affirming the country&apos;s EU ambitions, which coincided with the first election round. The source added that Moscow has been transporting Moldovan citizens by air and bus to Azerbaijan, Belarus, Turkey, and Moldova to vote, in an effort to boost Stoianoglo&#x2019;s chances.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-says-russia-intends-to-disrupt-expatriate-voting-in-nov-3-runoff-reuters-reports/	2024-11-02T20:48:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178740340.jpg
Ukraine calls on Moscow to provide list of POWs ready for swap	Kyiv urged Moscow on Nov. 3 to provide a list of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) prepared for an exchange, following Russia&#x2019;s accusation that Ukraine was obstructing the process. Ukrainian human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets reached out to his Russian counterpart: &quot;We are always ready to exchange prisoners of war!&quot; he wrote on his official Telegram channel. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Nov. 2 accused Ukraine of effectively sabotaging the exchange process and refusing to accept its own citizens. Zakharova claimed that Russia&#x2019;s defense ministry had offered to release 935 Ukrainian prisoners of war, but Ukraine had accepted only 279. Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, both countries have frequently exchanged prisoners. The most recent swap occurred in mid-October, with each side bringin back 95 prisoners. Lubinets countered that Ukraine remains willing to receive its citizens and blamed Russia for slowing down the exchanges. Russia&apos;s Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova also commented on Nov. 2 alleging that Ukraine has &quot;politicized&quot; the matter.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-calls-on-moscow-to-provide-list-of-pows-ready-for-swap/	2024-11-02T19:31:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156892680.jpg
Several Russian fake videos targeting US election are circulating online, sources tell CBS News	U.S. officials believe two additional fake videos now circulating online, which the FBI has identified as attempts to spread false claims about election security, are likely part of a Russian-backed influence campaign. The campaign appears to be aimed at swaying public opinion ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election, &#xA0;two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News. U.S. intelligence agencies and Microsoft have recently warned that foreign adversaries are engaging in influence campaigns to mislead voters ahead of the 2024 election. Both the U.S. government and Microsoft have indicated that Russia favors former President Donald Trump, while Iran supports Vice President Kamala Harris. The FBI released a statement on Nov. 2 clarifying that the videos &quot;are not authentic, are not from the FBI, and the content they depict is false.&quot; One video falsely alleges that &quot;the FBI has apprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud,&quot; while the second video targets Vice President Kamala Harris&#x2019;s husband Doug Emhoff. The FBI&#x2019;s statement did not identify the source behind the videos, and the agency declined further comment when approached by CBS News. However, the statement emphasized that the videos, which incorporate Justice Department and FBI logos as well as images of Emhoff, are part of efforts to mislead the public with &quot;false content about FBI operations.&quot; This latest disclosure brings the total number of fake, Russia-produced videos aimed at misleading U.S. voters to four, according to the government. On Oct. 31, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger highlighted another video claiming that Haitian voters illegally cast ballots for Vice President Kamala Harris, calling it a fake likely created by a Russian troll farm. In a joint statement on Nov. 1, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said that &quot;Russian influence actors&quot; manufactured the video.	https://kyivindependent.com/several-russian-fake-videos-targeting-us-election-are-circulating-online-sources-tell-cbs-news/	2024-11-02T16:20:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1813426206.jpg
Zelensky calls for tougher sanctions as Russia launched 2,000 drones attacks on Ukraine in October using foreign-made components	Russia launched over 2,000 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in October, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 2, while urging Western allies to apply more sanctions against the providers of components used in Russian drones. Russia continues to avoid sanctions through the use of sanctions evasion networks and shell companies. Russia is also aided in sanctions evasion through its allies, including China, Iran, and North Korea. &quot;This volume of Shahed drones means over 170,000 components that should have been blocked from reaching Russia,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;Microchips, microcontrollers, processors, and many other parts are essential for enabling this terror.&quot; &quot;All of these are supplied to Russia from abroad, unfortunately, from companies in China, Europe, and America&#x2014;a multitude of small but significant contributions to Russia&#x2019;s ongoing terror,&quot; Zelensky added. Zelensky&apos;s comments come as Russia launched a mass drone attack on Kyiv on Nov. 2, which caused a fire in a 16-story residential building and an office building, and left an 82-year-old woman with shrapnel injuries to the head. During his evening address, Zelensky called for sanctions against companies that deliver components to Russia to be made more expansive and effective. &quot;Such schemes also allow Russia to help strengthen the regimes in Iran and North Korea. This is a global threat, and it can only be overcome through global, coordinated pressure.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come a few days after the United States imposed sanctions on Oct. 30 against nearly 400 entities and individuals directly or indirectly involved in supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. The limitations applied to companies involved in sanctions evasion networks in 17 jurisdictions, including China, India, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Thailand, and Turkey, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Russia has launched tens of thousands of cheap but effective Iranian-designed Shahed-type drones against Ukraine since the fall of 2022. On Oct. 20, Zelensky said that a total of 6,130 Shahed-type drones since the start of 2024 &#x2014; although that number does not account for the hundreds of drones launched in the past two weeks. In recent months, Russia has stepped up its drone attacks targeting cities and towns across Ukraine on a near daily basis since the start of September.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-calls-for-tougher-sanctions-as-russia-launched-2-000-drones-attacks-on-ukraine-in-october-using-foreign-made-components/	2024-11-02T12:30:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177266193-1.jpg
Australia delivering JDAM-ER glide bomb kits to Ukraine, Australian media reports	Australia is providing Ukraine with Joint Direct Attack Munition Extended-Range (JDAM-ER) glide bombs kits following their withdrawal from service from the Royal Australian Air Force, Australian Defense Magazine reported on Nov. 1. JDAMs are wing kits that convert simple free-falling bombs into guided ammunition, improving accuracy thanks to a GPS helping the bomb adjust its course while approaching the target. Once dropped, the bomb deploys wings, allowing it to glide up to 72 kilometers, tripling the range of the original weapon, according to Bloomberg. Earlier this year in July, Australia announced 250 million Australian dollars ($168 million) in military assistance for Ukraine, in what was the largest package of aid the country has provided since the beginning of the full-scale war. Since then, Australia said on Oct. 16 that the country will donate 49 &quot;soon-to-be-retired&quot; U.S.-made Abrams tanks, Australian media outlet ABC News reported. According to Australian Defense Magazine, an unspecified number of JDAM-ERs were delivered to Ukraine, although it was not immediately clear as to when the weapons were delivered. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to independently verify the munitions transfer and Kyiv has not commented on their delivery. The delivery of the munitions falls in line the Australian government&apos;s Defence&#x2019;s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Plan, which revealed on Oct. 30 that the country withdrew its inventory of Australian-built 225-kg JDAM-ER glide bombs in 2021. The reported delivery of JDAMs comes as Russian KAB guided aerial bombs continue to decimate Ukrainian cities on the front line. Transforming older, predominantly Soviet-era aerial bombs into 500-kg guided bombs continues to damage civilian infrastructure while causing civilian casualties. Throughout the full-scale war, Ukraine has already used U.S.-made Joint Direct Attack Munition-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) guided kits for aerial bombs, which were first delivered in February 2023. During a visit to Kyiv in April 2024, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles previously announced that the country was &quot;providing critical air-to-ground precision munitions and short-range air defense systems.&quot; Controversy erupted earlier in 2024 when media reports emerged that the Australian military decided to quietly disassemble and bury its fleet of multi-role Taipan helicopters, even though Kyiv sent an official request for their transfer to Ukraine. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Australia has provided Ukraine with more than $1 billion in aid, including $866 million in military assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/australia-delivering-jdam-er-glide-bombs-kits-to-ukraine-australian-media-reports/	2024-11-02T10:51:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1941899735.jpg
China was well aware of North Korean troop deployment ahead of time, expert says	Beijing was fast at claiming that it had no knowledge of Russia&apos;s deepening partnership with North Korea. The U.S. had jumped on the opportunity, hoping to pressure China to dissuade North Korea from taking an active part in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Observers, however, are skeptical about China&apos;s signals, believing that the deal to deploy North Korean troops on Ukrainian battlefields couldn&apos;t have passed without Beijing&apos;s knowledge. North Korea&apos;s key ally, China, keeps the totalitarian regime of Kim Jong Un afloat. Beijing also provides billions worth of dual-use goods to Russia, having an increasingly important role in Moscow&apos;s ability to wage war on Ukraine. &quot;Contrary to what China says officially&#x2026; I don&apos;t think Pyongyang would have surprised China by sending troops without discussing it before,&quot; Mathieu Boulegue, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. The expert dismissed Beijing&apos;s diplomatic messaging as a &quot;big masquerade.&quot; Chinese dictator Mao Zedong once said that his homeland and North Korea are as close as &quot;lips and teeth.&quot; North Korea presents a useful buffer zone between China and the U.S.&apos;s allies in East Asia. The collapse of Kim Jong Un&apos;s regime would also drive millions of refugees across the Chinese border, creating a significant socioeconomic headache for Beijing. &quot;Without China&apos;s consent, there wouldn&apos;t be a North Korean regime,&quot; Boulegue said in comments for the Kyiv Independent. Over half a century after Mao&apos;s comments, Beijing continues to be Pyongyang&apos;s only lifeline. Business with China represents more than 90% of North Korea&apos;s total trade turnover. When the two countries closed their border in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea&apos;s economy dropped by 4.5%. But the relationship hasn&apos;t always been smooth. China began nurturing economic ties with South Korea, now Beijing&apos;s third-largest trade partner. Beijing has also shown displeasure with the North Korean nuclear program. China has shown restraint in its nuclear rhetoric and allegedly discouraged Moscow from using nuclear arms. On Oct. 31, North Korea tested an intercontinental missile in an ostentatious demonstration of its nuclear capabilities. Pyongyang declared South Korea a &quot;hostile state,&quot; renouncing the previous official policy of &quot;peaceful reunification.&quot; Pyongyang has been increasingly relying on Moscow for support. Ukraine and the U.S. believe that in return for arms and troops, North Korea has obtained financial support for its impoverished economy, as well as technology for its nuclear program. Kim might also welcome the chance to test his fighters on a modern-day battlefield. According to Ukraine, North Korea has dispatched 12,000 troops to Russia, with the first soldiers expected to join the fight in November. &quot;The Chinese side is not aware of the situation,&quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said.

(Ed JONES / AFP via Getty Images)Moscow and Pyongyang indeed kept Beijing out of the loop, the Chinese leadership has reasons to be displeased. Jan Svec, a China researcher at the Prague-based Institute of International Affairs, says that Beijing may be concerned about a &quot;closer military cooperation of South Korea and Japan with the U.S. and NATO&quot; as a result. &quot;At the same time, North Korea can become more dependent on Russia, and thus become less dependent on China, leaving China with fewer leverage,&quot; the expert told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;North Korea wants advanced military and missile technology, but the broader goal of signaling the existence of an anti-Western coalition&#x2014;which is not going to dissipate&#x2014;is also important,&quot; Edward Howell, a North Korea expert at Oxford University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Russia has provided North Korea with unwavering support at the U.N. Security Council over the past year, a maneuver that fulfills both Russian and North Korean interests.&quot; According to Howell, &quot;China will not be pleased with North Korea&apos;s ongoing claims that its &apos;number one friend&apos; is Russia.&quot; Yet, Boulegue, who focuses on Russian-Chinese security relations, believes it unlikely that Pyongyang and Moscow would take such escalatory steps without Beijing&apos;s tacit approval. &quot;They (China) probably obtained something from Russia in terms of a trade-off,&quot; the expert said. &quot;Another question is: what did they get in return?&quot; Boulegue underscores that despite its diplomatic posturing, China has been indirectly supporting Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine for years. While not openly supplying Russia with arms, China is a key partner in Moscow&apos;s war, providing it with dual-use goods that keep the Russian arms industry running and helping it withstand Western sanctions. From Beijing&apos;s perspective, such a &quot;proxy war&quot; in Ukraine creates a &quot;cheap and efficient splinter that keeps us (the West) busy&quot; while keeping its hands clean, Boulegue argues. &quot;And North Korea is definitely part of that indirect strategy.&quot; The main proponents of the idea that China is displeased with North Korea point to Beijing&apos;s economic interests in Europe and a desire for regional stability. China does not shy away from confronting the U.S., especially when it comes to Taiwan. At the same time, China generally avoids antagonizing the EU, enjoying the profitable trade and trying to undermine the bond between the two sides of the Atlantic. But the West has already named China as the culprit of Russia&apos;s war, underscoring the Chinese role during the latest NATO summit. The U.S. and EU have also imposed sanctions against Chinese companies. Yet, China doesn&apos;t seem concerned.

(Kim Won Jin / AFP via Getty Images)&quot;I don&apos;t think that this (the transfer of North Korean troops) is such a decisive step that would lead to some kind of significant change of China&apos;s attitude toward North Korea or Russia,&quot; Svec believes. While the U.S. has reportedly appealed to China to dissuade North Korea from sending its troops to fight Ukraine, it is unlikely that this request will be any more successful than the ones made in the past two and half years of the war. Boulegue says that the West lacks leverage to pressure North Korea through China. At the same time, the expert argues that the poorly trained and equipped North Korean troops are not going to be any kind of &quot;strategic game changer&quot; on the battlefield. He expects Moscow to keep them mostly in support roles to prevent heavy losses on their part. Throwing North Korean troops into &quot;human wave&quot; attacks that Russian troops face on a daily basis &quot;is not going to look good for (Russia&apos;s) relationship with China and North Korea as well,&quot; he concludes.	https://kyivindependent.com/china-was-well-aware-of-north-korean-troop-deployment-ahead-of-time-experts-say/	2024-11-02T10:15:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152601785.jpg
Russian attack near Dnipro injures 5, including children, governor says	Russian forces attacked Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Nov. 2, injuring five people, including two children, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. An explosion was reported near the city of Dnipro soon after an air raid alert went off in the region. The Russian attack damaged the infrastructure, according to Lysak. No further details, including regarding the weapon used, were disclosed. Dnipro, Ukraine&apos;s fourth-largest city with a pre-war population of about one million, has served as a key logistics and humanitarian hub during the full-scale war. It is located approximately 395 kilometers (245 miles) from Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-near-dnipro-injures-5-including-children-governor-says/	2024-11-02T09:01:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2098827396.jpg
Putin achieved none of his strategic objectives after nearly 1,000 days of war against Ukraine, Austin says	Russian President Vladimir Putin has not achieved a single one of his strategic objectives after nearly 1,000 days of full-scale war against Ukraine, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in his op-ed published by Foreign Affairs on Nov. 1. &quot;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn&#x2019;t flee. Kyiv didn&#x2019;t fall. And Ukraine didn&#x2019;t fold,&quot; the Pentagon chief said. Putin&apos;s original goals in his full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in early 2022 were to &#x201C;liberate the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, &quot;demilitarize and denazify&quot; the country which in the Kremlin&apos;s eyes, envisioned the removal of its Jewish president, and the occupation of its capital city Kyiv. After swiftly failing to achieve these goals, with the exception of Russian forces occupying all of Luhansk Oblast, Putin was forced to lower his ambitions and said Russia&apos;s &quot;main goal&quot; was to capture all of Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas area that also includes the adjacent Donetsk Oblast. According to Austin, Russia has paid &quot;a staggering price for Putin&#x2019;s imperial folly,&quot; with more than $200 billion squandered. Russia has lost almost 700,000 troops killed and injured since Feb. 2022, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported. Austin&apos;s article was published days ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump questioned future U.S. military assistance for Ukraine while insisting he can broker a swift peace agreement. In the meantime, Ukraine is facing one of Russia&apos;s &quot;most powerful offensives&quot; since the beginning of the all-out war, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 2. Moscow&apos;s forces continue to press forward on its offensives across the eastern front, primarily on the Toretsk, Kurakhove, and Pokrovsk axes in Donetsk Oblast, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw little by little. Austin called Putin&apos;s invasion a warning, describing it as a sneak preview of &quot;a world built by tyrants and thugs.&quot; &quot;So we face a hinge in history,&quot; the U.S. Defense Secretary said. &quot;If Ukraine falls under Putin&#x2019;s boot, all of Europe will fall under Putin&#x2019;s shadow.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-achieved-none-of-his-strategic-objectives-after-nearly-1-000-days-of-war-against-ukraine-us-defense-secretary-says/	2024-11-02T08:48:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1483828070.jpeg
Kadyrov claims he revoked order not to take Ukrainian soldiers prisoner	Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claimed on Nov. 2 that he had revoked the order to his troops not to capture Ukrainian soldiers. After the first drone strike against Russia&apos;s North Caucasus republic that targeted the Russian Special Forces University of Vladimir Putin in the Chechen city of Gudermes on Oct. 29, Kadyrov said he ordered all of his commanders fighting against Ukraine &quot;not to take prisoners,&quot; and instead kill all surrendering Ukrainian soldiers as retribution. In his recent Telegram post, Kadyrov claimed that received &quot;more than 2,000 letters from Ukrainians&quot; asking to cancel the dictator&apos;s order. He did not provide any proof to back his allegations. Kadyrov had earlier claimed there were casualties among the captives after a drone strike on Chechnya that Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) were killed as a result of the drone strike on the military university. Kyiv did not claim responsibility for the attack, also declining to comment on Kadyrov&apos;s claims. A Ukrainian intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 29 that the drone strike was possibly launched from the neighboring republics of Dagestan or Ingushetia and may have been connected to a feud between Kadyrov and officials from the two regions. Ukraine has documented over 100 cases of Russia summarily executing Ukrainian POWs since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets clarified that the actual number is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence, such as videos of the executions.	https://kyivindependent.com/kadyrov-claims-he-revoked-the-order-not-to-capture-ukrainian-soldiers/	2024-11-02T06:58:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1827747016--1-.jpg
Poland offers to provide Ukraine with weapons on 'defense loan,' Sikorski says	The Polish government proposed to support Ukraine in the form of a &quot;defense loan,&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in an interview with Polsat News published on Nov. 1. Speaking about aid for Kyiv, Sikorski said that Ukraine could buy weapons from Polish factories on credit. The loan could be paid after the country&apos;s reconstruction, he added. According to Sikorski, such a step could have been taken at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Responding to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s criticism over the slow supply of MiG-29 fighter jets, the Polish minister said that his country has done more for Kyiv &quot;than any other nation.&quot; Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of all-out war in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees. The country has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Ukraine to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. Yet, bilateral relations are far from perfect, with the two countries sharing long-standing grievances on historical memory policy that are far from being resolved.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-offers-to-provide-ukraine-with-weapons-on-defense-loan-sikorski-says/	2024-11-02T06:09:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179726505.jpg
Ukraine to produce anti-drone missiles with Belgian manufacturer	The Thales Belgium manufacturer agreed with the Ukrainian defense industry on a joint production of missiles to counter drones, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Nov. 2. &quot;This cooperation will strengthen the Ukrainian defense industry and the protection of critical infrastructure from enemy drones,&quot; Smetanin said. In recent months, Russia has ramped up drone strikes, while reducing its use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. More than 2,000 strike drones were launched against Ukraine during October, the General Staff reported on Nov. 1, which breaks the previous record set in September by nearly 700. The two companies signed a memorandum of cooperation. The work between Kyiv and Brussels is expected to expand to technology transfer and production of missile components in the future, the minister added. Thales is reportedly the only company worldwide developing, manufacturing and supplying a complete rocket system, including fire control systems, weapons and ammunition. It is specialized in the field of air-to-ground 70mm rocket systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-produce-anti-drone-missiles-with-belgian-manufacturer/	2024-11-02T05:06:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2158253344.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 68 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed five people and injured 68 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Nov. 2. Ukrainian forces downed 39 out of 71 Shahed-type drones and other unidentified drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Twenty-one other drones were &quot;lost,&quot; and five more flew back towards Russia, it added. Debris from downed drones damaged residential buildings and an office building in Kyiv during an hours-long attack, local authorities said. Russian forces also reportedly fired a Kh-31P cruise missile against Ukraine overnight. Two S-400 missiles hit a police station in Kharkiv, killing police officer Andrii Matvienko. Thirty-six police officers, nine civilians, and one rescuer were injured in the attack, according to the Interior Ministry. The strikes damaged 20 residential buildings, as well as heating and water supply networks, and 19 vehicles, local authorities said. Russian forces also attacked a five-story residential building in the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, injuring a 44-year-old man and two women aged 68 and 75, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. A Russian drone also hit a residential building in the city of Sumy. At least eight people suffered injuries, local authorities reported. Four people were killed in the settlements of Sukhi Yaly, Yuriivka and Chasiv Yar in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. Four more people were injured in the region over the past day. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 15 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Seven people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-5-injure-60-over-past-day/	2024-11-02T04:13:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-02_09-47-58.jpg
Ukraine facing one of Russia's 'most powerful' offensives since start of all-out war, Syrskyi says	Ukrainian troops are holding back one of Russia&apos;s &quot;most powerful&quot; offensives since the start of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 2. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in its defense of the front line, particularly in Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive potential. After a meeting with a delegation of the Czech Armed Forces, Syrskyi described the situation on the battlefield as difficult. &quot;Active hostilities that continue in certain areas require constant renewal of the resources of Ukrainian units,&quot; he said. Since the beginning of the day, 126 clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces have taken place along the front line, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said in its latest update on Nov. 2. Russia continues to press forward on its offensives across the eastern front, primarily on the Toretsk, Kurakhove, and Pokrovsk axes in Donetsk Oblast, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are forced to withdraw little by little. In recent weeks, the Ukrainian military warned that Russia is escalating its operations in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. In Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian forces liberated and &quot;cleared out&quot; in mid-October the village of Kruhliakivka, which Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) described as important for the defense of Kupiansk. In the meantime, Russian troops are reportedly attempting to establish crossings near the Oskil River to advance toward the city of Kupiansk. The reports came as Russia is planning to involve North Korean troops to aid its war effort, with more than 7,000 soldiers deployed near the Ukrainian border. In a recent interview, President Volodymyr Zelensky blasted Ukraine&apos;s partners &quot;zero&quot; response to deployment of North Korean troops for the war in Ukraine. He said that if Kyiv had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; where North Korean troops are gathering.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-facing-one-of-russias-most-powerful-offensives-since-start-of-all-out-war-syrskyi-says/	2024-11-02T02:55:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2180021122.jpg
North Korean soldiers sent to Ukrainian border equipped with standard infantry weapons, military intelligence says	Russia has armed North Korean troops deployed near the border with Ukraine with infantry weapons, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Nov. 2. According to HUR, North Korean soldiers received 60-mm mortars, AK-12 rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, Feniks anti-tank guided missiles, and hand-held anti-tank grenade launchers. They also reportedly received some night vision devices, thermal imagers, collimator sights, and binoculars. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, citing communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. Russia deployed more than 7,000 North Korean troops from Russia&apos;s Primorsky Krai to the Ukrainian border, the agency said. These numbers almost coincide with those of Washington&apos;s announced earlier this week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that some 8,000 North Korean troops are amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, HUR reported. Soldiers are reportedly currently undergoing training at five military camps in the Russian Far East. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Russian forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-sent-to-ukrainian-border-equipped-with-standard-infantry-weapons-military-intelligence-says/	2024-11-02T02:03:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg

Russia targets Kyiv overnight on Nov. 2, damages apartment building	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian drone strike on Kyiv&#x2019;s Sviatoshynskyi district overnight on Nov. 2 caused a fire in a 16-story residential building, injuring two people and causing damage to upper floors. The blaze, which broke out on the upper floors, spread across an area of roughly 50 square meters, Ukraine&apos;s State Emergency Service reported. The attack damaged several apartments on the building&#x2019;s 15th and 16th floors, with the top floor suffering the most severe destruction. First responders evacuated 18 residents, according to local authorities. One of the injured was transfered to the local hospital, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. The Nov. 2 attack is the latest in a series of drone strikes targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine&#x2019;s capital. On Oct. 29, Russia attacked Kyiv with drones injuring six people in Kyiv&apos;s Solomyanskyi district, authorities reported. Air defense remains active in Kyiv as of 7:45 a.m. local time. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force earlier warned about drone threats to the capital.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-targets-kyiv-overnight-on-nov-2-damages-apartment-building/	2024-11-01T22:55:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-01-23_48_13.jpeg
Russia imprisons former US consulate employee for ‘secret collaboration with foreign state’	A Russian court on Nov. 1 sentenced Robert Shonov, a former employee of the U.S. consulate in Vladivostok, to four years and 10 months in prison for &quot;secret collaboration with a foreign state.&quot; Shonov, a Russian national who worked at the consulate for over 25 years until 2021, became a private contractor after Moscow restricted local staff from working at foreign missions, gathering public Russian media reports for the U.S., according to the U.S. State Department. Shonov was detained in 2023, accused of passing information on Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine to the U.S. in exchange for payment. Primorye&#x2019;s regional court disclosed that 400,000 roubles ($4,100) and an electronic device were confiscated as part of the investigation. In September, Russia expelled two U.S. diplomats, alleging they served as intermediaries for Shonov. The U.S. State Department defended Shonov&#x2019;s activities as lawful, saying he &quot;worked as a private contractor compiling press accounts from publicly accessible Russian media, in strict compliance with Russia&#x2019;s laws and regulations.&quot; Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the allegations against Mr. Shonov &quot;are wholly without merit.&quot; This incident adds to a series of U.S. nationals arrested in Russia, with several now serving lengthy sentences or awaiting trial. Washington, a key backer of Ukraine against Russian forces, accuses Moscow of seeking prisoner swaps for Russians held in the U.S. Though the U.S. and Russia executed a notable prisoner swap in August that included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, several American and dual-national detainees remain in Russian custody.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-imprisons-former-us-consulate-employee-for-secret-collaboration-with-foreign-state/	2024-11-01T21:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1813426206.jpg
Georgia election results indicate possible manipulation, two US pollsters say	Two U.S. pollsters, commissioned by Georgian opposition forces, are questioning the official results of the Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which declared the ruling Georgian Dream party victorious. Opposition parties are organizing another protest next week to contest these results. Edison Research, hired by the pro-opposition Formula TV, highlighted significant differences between its exit poll and the official count, suggesting &quot;manipulation&quot; of the vote. Another U.S. pollster, HarrisX, which conducted an exit poll for pro-opposition Mtavari Arkhi, described the official results as &quot;statistically impossible,&quot; Reuters reported. This election is critical for Georgia&apos;s future direction, with voters choosing between a pro-Western opposition advocating for European integration and the Georgian Dream party, which leans toward Moscow and faces accusations of authoritarianism. Election observer groups like the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) reported incidents of ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, and bribery, though they stopped short of declaring the election stolen. Russia has denied any interference. Both Edison and HarrisX had projected a parliamentary majority for Georgia&#x2019;s four main opposition parties. However, a separate exit poll from Georgian pollster GORBI, commissioned by pro-government Imedi TV, predicted Georgian Dream would win with 56% of the vote. Thousands protested in Tbilisi after the election, with more demonstrations planned, while Georgia&#x2019;s pro-Western president condemned the election as fraudulent. Edison&apos;s exit poll suggested Georgian Dream took only 41% of the vote, 13 points below the official count of 54%. &quot;The 13-point difference between Edison&#x2019;s estimate and the official result... cannot be explained by normal variation alone and suggests local-level manipulation of the vote,&quot; Edison&apos;s Executive Vice President Rob Farbman said in a statement. Edison&#x2019;s review found that the deviation from statistically expected results was widespread but most pronounced at specific polling locations in rural areas. In urban areas, Georgian Dream underperformed, while in rural areas, it reportedly achieved margins as high as 90%. Georgian state prosecutors, under Western pressure, announced a probe into allegations of election falsification.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-election-results-indicate-possible-manipulation-two-us-pollsters-say/	2024-11-01T19:59:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180900026.jpg
Ukraine launches 5G pilot project	Ukraine is launching a 5G pilot project in three cities to test the network&apos;s compatibility with military technology, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Nov. 1. 5G, the fifth-generation cellular network technology, offers significantly faster data-transmission speeds than its predecessor, 4G. The Ukrainian government has amended the resolution on the use of radio frequencies, paving the way for the country to test 5G technology, according to Fedorov. The two-year pilot program will cover three cities and include two stages, he said. The National Cybersecurity Coordination Center (NCCC) and Ukrainian State Center for Radio Frequencies will partner to test whether or not 5G equipment interferes with military networks. &quot;5G is capable of transmitting data 10 times faster than 4G, so it creates new opportunities for exchanging large amounts of information at ultra-high speeds,&quot; Fedorov said. &quot;This is one of the key steps towards the full launch of 5G in Ukraine, which we plan to complete by 2030.&quot; Fedorov said the launch of 5G could provide more flexibility to operators and ensure the development of high-quality telecommunications despite the pressures of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Fedorov did not identify the three cities that would participate in the pilot program.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-launches-5g-pilot-project/	2024-11-01T17:15:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/30_8_GLOBSEC_FEDOROV_KI-2.jpg
World 'merely watching' as North Korea threat grows, Zelensky warns	The international community is &quot;merely watching&quot; as the threat of North Korean military aggression grows, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a social media post on Nov. 1. Zelensky said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are gathering. The president&apos;s warning follows reports that 8,000 North Korean troops are amassed in Kursk Oblast and preparing to enter combat alongside Russian forces in the coming days. &quot;North Korea has tested a new ballistic missile just yesterday, achieving record time and sufficient altitude,&quot; Zelensky said on X. &quot;Yet the world is just watching, observing as this threat grows.&quot; Pyongyang&apos;s cooperation with Moscow has enabled improvements in North Korean military technology that are &quot;already evident,&quot; he said. With North Korean troops joining Russia on the battlefield, Pyongyang will also have the opportunity to learn the tactics of &quot;modern warfare.&quot; &#xA0; &quot;The first thousands of North Korean soldiers are already near Ukraine&apos;s borders, and Ukrainians will be forced to defend themselves against them,&quot; Zelensky said. Ukraine is able to see &quot;every site on Russian territory where these North Korean soldiers are accumulating&#x2014;every camp,&quot; Zelensky said. With permission to launch Western long-range weapons at these targets, Ukraine could potentially prevent the deployment of North Korean troops on the front lines. &quot;Instead of providing the crucial long-range capabilities, however, America is watching, Britain is watching, and Germany is watching.&quot; Zelensky also called on China to exert its influence over Russia and North Korea, urging Beijing to prove its commitment to ending the war. While there have been growing reports that the U.K. may amend its position on Ukraine&apos;s of its Storm Shadow missiles for long-range strikes, the U.S. and Germany continue to insist &#xA0;that such a move would lead to unnecessary escalation with Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/world-merely-watching-as-north-korea-threat-grows-zelensky-warns/	2024-11-01T15:34:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178138302.jpg
Europe, Azerbaijan not close to deal on gas route via Ukraine, Slovakia's SPP says	European firms are not close to an agreement with Azerbaijan to replace Russian gas flows through Ukraine, Slovakian state-owned gas importer SPP told Reuters on Nov. 1, contradicting earlier media reports that said a deal was at hand. Ukraine currently transits Russian gas to the European Union as part of a deal signed in 2019, which is set to expire in December 2024. Europe and Ukraine have been in talks with Azerbaijan to replace Russia as a supplier. Bloomberg reported on Oct. 1 that energy companies from Hungary and Slovakia were nearing a contract for up to 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas from Azerbaijan per year, citing people familiar with the negotiations. Slovak energy supplier SPP dismissed these reports in a statement to Reuters. &quot;We regularly discuss the topic with our partners, but the information about the upcoming conclusion of a gas supply contract with the participation of SPP is not true,&quot; SPP&apos;s statement read. Slovakia is among the countries most reliant on Russian energy supplies. While Moscow cut much of its pipeline gas transit to Europe in 2022, Slovakia, Austria, and Hungary remain heavily dependent on Russian imports. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on Sept. 6 that negotiations are underway with the EU, Moscow, and Kyiv to transport Azeri gas after Ukraine stops transiting Russian gas. Gas supplies from Azerbaijan would have to first transit through southern Russia before reaching Ukraine. Europe is &quot;fully committed&quot; to phasing out Russian gas and is &quot;ready to live without this Russian gas coming from the Ukrainian transit route,&quot; EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said on Sept. 11.	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-azerbaijan-not-close-to-deal-on-gas-route-via-ukraine-slovakias-spp-says/	2024-11-01T14:40:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1245921933.jpg
North Korean FM visits Moscow, promises to support Russia until 'victory' in Ukraine	North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui promised that North Korea would stand with Russia &quot;until the day of victory&quot; during talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Nov. 1. Choe&apos;s visit comes as 8,000 North Korean troops are reportedly preparing to enter combat alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Our traditional, historically friendly relations, which have traveled the tested path of history, today ... are rising to a new level of relations of invincible military comradeship,&quot; Choe told Lavrov. Choe went on to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s &quot;wise leadership&quot; and said North Korea is convinced Russia will &quot;achieve a great victory in their sacred struggle to protect the sovereign rights and security interests of their state.&quot; &quot;And we also assure that until the day of victory we will firmly stand alongside our Russian comrades,&quot; she said. Moscow and Pyongyang signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, pledging to provide military support to one another if either comes under attack. The Russian parliament ratified the defense treaty in October, amid reports that North Korea was sending troops along with weapons to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. Kyiv has said that North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR). U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31 that at least 8,000 North Korean forces have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and are expected to participate in active combat in the coming days. &quot;North Korean troops have not yet engaged in combat, but this is a matter of days, not months,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 31, urging Ukraine&apos;s allies to mount a more aggressive response to the Moscow-Pyongyang alliance. &quot;When deployed, they will be pushed forward, sustaining heavy losses, as Russia tries to minimize its own troop mobilization.&quot; Choe and Lavrov did not mention the reports of troop deployment in their remarks. Zelensky has said that Russia has confirmed North Korea&apos;s direct involvement in the war to the West via military intelligence channels.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-fm-visits-moscow-promises-to-support-russia-until-victory-in-ukraine/	2024-11-01T13:55:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181551367.jpg
Ukraine war latest: US announces new aid package; Ukrainian drones target oil depot in Russia's Stavropol Krai	Key developments on Nov. 1: Washington announced on Nov. 1 a new military aid package for Kyiv worth $425 million, according to a U.S. Defense Department press release. A day prior, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a joint press conference that the U.S. would &quot;soon&quot; provide Ukraine with another aid package in light of North Korean troops&apos; involvement in Russia&apos;s war. The recent military assistance is provided under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) which pulls weapons from U.S. stocks. The aid list includes munitions for NASAMS missile systems, Stinger missiles, ammunition for HIMARS rocket systems, tube-launched, optically tracked, and wire-guided (TOW) missiles, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, as well as 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition. Washington will also provide Kyiv with air-to-ground munitions, Stryker armored personnel carriers, counter-unmanned aerial systems (c-UAS) equipment and munitions, some medical equipment, and spare parts, among other contents of the package. The U.S. recently allocated another military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Kyiv on Oct. 21. Austin had arrived in Kyiv unexpectedly to discuss further support as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Concerns are growing that if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris, he may withdraw or reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, potentially forcing the country into painful concessions. Despite U.S. assistance, Russian forces continue grinding forward in eastern Ukraine, while the country braces for renewed strikes against its energy grid as winter approaches. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 30 said the U.S. has transferred to Ukraine nearly 10% of the $61 billion aid approved by Congress in April 2024. A Ukrainian drone fell on the territory of an oil depot in the town of Svetlograd in Russia&apos;s Stavropol Krai overnight on Nov. 1, Governor Vladimir Vladimirov claimed. According to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry, Russian air defenses overnight shot down 36 drones over Kursk Oblast, 20 over Bryansk Oblast, 12 over occupied Crimea, eight over Voronezh Oblast, four over Oryol Oblast, and three over Belgorod Oblast. The Russian Baza Telegram channel posted a video purporting to show a drone exploding at the oil depot in Svetlograd. The town of Svetlograd has around 35,000 residents and lies over 600 (372 miles) kilometers southeast of Ukraine&apos;s border in Donetsk Oblast. No casualties or damage have been reported. Emergency services were at the scene, Vladimirov said. Alexander Bogomaz, Bryansk Oblast governor, claimed that a drone hit an apartment building in the city of Bryansk overnight, injuring one person. Kyiv has not commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. A Ukrainian drone reportedly struck on Oct. 31 an oil refinery in the city of Ufa in Russia&apos;s Bashkortostan Republic, which lies some 1,500 kilometers from Ukraine&apos;s border. Russia has seized more territory in its war with Ukraine over the past week than at any point in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 1, using Bloomberg Intelligence calculations based on the DeepState map service that tracks battlefield changes in coordination with Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry. In recent months, Russian troops carried out a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses. Russia has captured 1,146 square kilometers (442 square miles) in Ukraine since Aug. 6, about a quarter more than in the first seven months of the year, the media outlet said. The Russian military also advanced by 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) over the past week, Bloomberg reported. As Russia makes gains on the battlefield, Ukrainian officials are growing more despondent about the future course of the war, according to one official close to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office who spoke to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, according to Estonian intelligence, Moscow has seized 150 square kilometers (58 square miles) in the Donetsk sector of the front line over the past week. Russian troops have reportedly captured the town of Selydove, but Ukraine has not yet confirmed the reports. Bloomberg said Russia&apos;s next targets are the towns of Poskovsk and Kurakhove, important logistical hubs for the Ukrainian military. Observers and the Ukrainian military have previously warned of an increasingly difficult situation in the town as Russian forces have been pushing forward over the past few weeks. The Ukrainian military said on Oct. 29 that it had repelled 11 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, including near Selydove. Russia launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine during October, the General Staff reported on Nov. 1, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700. A total of 2,023 were recorded, according to the report. Of these, 1,185 were downed, 738 were &quot;lost,&quot; and 29 flew back out of Ukraine&apos;s airspace. No information was given about the remaining 71, but numerous strikes by Russian drones were reported during October, such as attacks that killed two people including a 15-year-old girl in Kyiv in recent days. According to the General Staff, Russia has launched a total of 6,987 strike drones since the start of the year, meaning 29% of them were launched during last month. The total number is significantly higher than September&apos;s previous record tally. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, 1,339 Shahed-type kamikaze drones targeted the country in September, 1,107 of which were shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare and flying into Russian or Belarusian airspace. Around 45 were unaccounted for with no further details given. Moscow has ramped up drone strikes, while dialing down the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said this may well be in preparation for an unprecedented mass attack rather than any sort of restraint from the Kremlin. &quot;UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles/drones) can be used as pathfinders,&quot; Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;A tool to force (an air defense) radar to light up, allowing the Russians to map the layout of defenses around Kyiv and other fairly well-defended cities.&quot; Kaushal and other experts warn that Moscow&apos;s reliance on drones over missiles is likely a sign of a particularly large aerial attack in the near future. &quot;It&apos;s been quite a while since we saw a large-scale missile strike, which worries me,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Part of this could relate to the fact they are ramping up not just for one or two mass strikes, but perhaps several more with the objective of fully disintegrating Ukraine&apos;s electrical grid within a short period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;It could also be to allow for comprehensive follow-on attacks after initial blows have been dealt to make sure it cannot be effectively repaired.&quot; North Korean troops are likely to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine, potentially exceeding those of Russia, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, told the Estonian public broadcaster ERR on Nov. 1. The first North Korean soldiers were deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in late October, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported earlier. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. North Korean soldiers are usually trained to fight in mountainous terrain, which means they are not familiar with Ukrainian territory, its climate, and geography, Kiviselg said. &quot;Their training does not include combat operations in such conditions, and the training they receive in the Russian Federation is certainly not of a very high level,&quot; Kiviselg said. &quot;Therefore, we can expect North Korean units to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine, and probably even more than the Russian Federation&apos;s forces have suffered so far.&quot; He said that the North Korean troops arrived in Kursk Oblast in &quot;early October,&quot; having previously undergone two to four weeks of training. Following this, North Korean soldiers redeployed to the &quot;Ukrainian front,&quot; Kiviselg added. &quot;The arrival of North Korean soldiers on the Ukrainian front will likely take place in stages,&quot; Kiviselg said. &quot;If this additional deployment of (North Korean) units in Russia, their training, and then arrival on the Ukrainian front continues in the long term, it could certainly bring some changes to the front line.&quot; Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, according to U.S. intelligence. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, citing communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Russian forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-announces-new-aid-package-ukrainian-drones-target-oil-depot-in-russias-stavropol-krai/	2024-11-01T13:17:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2161682493.jpg
Lavrov criticizes Turkey for supplying military equipment to Ukraine	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized Turkey&apos;s supply of military equipment to Ukraine to help it fight off Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, the Turkish outlet Hurriyet reported on Nov. 1. While Turkey is a NATO member, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has still aimed to maintain positive relations with both Russia and Ukraine. Lavrov expressed his gratitude to the Turkish government &quot;for facilitating the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis,&quot; particularly mentioning the talks between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul in March 2022, which were eventually abandoned after Ukrainians retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. Yet the Russian foreign minister criticized Turkey for supporting Ukraine in the war by supplying military equipment. Lavrov said this &quot;cannot but cause surprise,&quot; given the Turkish leadership&apos;s statements about its readiness to mediate between Ukraine and Russia. Erdogan has publicly supported Ukrainian sovereignty, and his administration has given significant aid to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ankara also has long been trying to take a leading role in peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Meanwhile, Turkey has also facilitated the flow of Russian oil to the European Union since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabling the Kremlin to circumvent the bloc&apos;s sanctions. In 2023, Ankara became the world&apos;s biggest buyer of Russian fossil fuels, importing around 42.2 billion euros ($45.9 billion) in oil, natural gas, and coal from the country &#x2014; a fivefold increase over the past decade. The Financial Times (FT) on Oct. 22 reported that Turkey had quietly blocked the export of U.S.-origin military goods to Russia following a warning from Washington.	https://kyivindependent.com/lavrov-criticizes-turkey-for-supplying-military-equipment-to-ukraine/	2024-11-01T12:35:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2050986119.jpg
Ukrainian Americans weigh in on upcoming Trump vs Harris election	If Democratic candidate Kamala Harris&#x2019;s campaign promises to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia would make her the obvious choice for Ukrainian Americans in the 2024 presidential elections, voters in the diaspora are anything but united in their choice for president. Despite Republican candidate Donald Trump&#x2019;s open hostility to aid for Ukraine and apparent close relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, some Ukrainian American voters feel he&#x2019;s the one who could end the war swiftly. &#x201C;If there is any president who would be able to get Putin to negotiate a deal that Putin would agree with because he can go back to his people and say he&#x2019;s a winner but leave most of Ukraine intact, I think it&#x2019;s Trump,&#x201D; Ukrainian American Dennis Goldenberg told the Kyiv Independent. As voters head to the polls on Nov. 5 in a presidential election that is predicted to be decided on razor-thin margins, many voting Ukrainian Americans will be doing so with the war in mind, but with competing visions of which president could better serve Ukraine. Ukrainians in the U.S. who can&#x2019;t vote are watching the election with the hopes that their would-be pick for president will be the one to bring peace to the nation at war. In the run-up to the election, the Kyiv Independent asked Ukrainians in the U.S. who can and can&#x2019;t vote about the outcome they&#x2019;d most like to see. In Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state with 19 Electoral College votes that likely provides a path to victory for either presidential candidate, the Philadelphia area is home to one of America&#x2019;s largest Ukrainian communities. Eugene Luciw, president of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America&#x2019;s Philadelphia Branch says that as a resident of the area, he knows Ukrainian Americans across the political spectrum. He says it&#x2019;s not surprising that many Ukrainians will vote for Trump, but emotionally, it&#x2019;s a bit surprising. As a registered Republican, he&#x2019;s familiar with the argument Ukrainian Americans make for Trump. Eugene Luciw, a registered Republican and leader in Philadelphia&#x2019;s Ukrainian community in New York City, U.S., on Oct. 24, 2024. Voting for Kamala Harris is an easy decision for Eugene Luciw. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The case &#x2013; with which he doesn&#x2019;t agree &#x2014; they make goes as follows: Russia illegally annexed Crimea while the U.S. was under a Democratic administration, then under Trump&#x2019;s four years, Russia didn&#x2019;t invade Ukraine only to launch a full-scale invasion once a Democrat was back in the White House. &#x201C;They see a pattern of weakness (with Democrats), a pattern of strength (with Republicans), and I think that translates into a hope and belief that Trump, if elected president, will provide that strong man motif.&#x201D; They believe Trump will respond strongly and back down the adversary despite what he says on the trail,&quot; he says. &#x201C;I believe Trump (when) he says he is going to try and resolve the (war) in one day, and the fact that he will resolve it in one day, the only way you&#x2019;re going to do that is to force Ukraine to give up its current territory,&#x201D; Luciw says. &#x201C;I think that&#x2019;s abundantly stupid for Ukraine. I am going to cast my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.&#x201D; Goldberg has never doubted his decision to vote for Trump on Nov. 5. For the Ukrainian American from Philadelphia, the best election outcome for Ukraine is a powerful U.S. leader, which he says he sees more in Trump than in Harris. &#x201C;I think his view on this war matches mine, which is that, ultimately, I fear that if the war continues, it&#x2019;s going to get bogged down in a stalemate. I think (Trump) understands a little bit better how Putin operates,&#x201D; Goldberg says. &#x201C;If there is any president who would be able to get Putin to negotiate a deal that Putin would agree with because he can go back to his people and say he&#x2019;s a winner but leave most of Ukraine intact, I think it&#x2019;s Trump.&#x201D; It isn&#x2019;t just the war in Ukraine that Goldberg is voting on. He supports Trump&#x2019;s proposed tax cuts and thinks he put the Middle East closer to peace than any president. He also supports the building of a wall on the U.S. southern border with Mexico to stymie illegal immigration. Half of Goldberg&#x2019;s family is from Moldova, and the other half is from Kamianets-Podilskyi, in the west of Ukraine. Goldberg says he believes in Trump&#x2019;s alleged ability to end the war within 24 hours of taking office. &#x201C;I kind of do get that he doesn&#x2019;t want to say how he is going to do it because then he loses leverage because once you tell your plan, your enemy knows your plan.&#x201D; Goldberg told the Kyiv Independent that he thinks Trump will be best for Ukraine because he&#x2019;s been the only president of the last four under which Russia hasn&#x2019;t taken more territory. Putin illegally annexed Crimea and invaded Ukraine&apos;s east during the term of Trump&#x2019;s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and invaded Georgia under the last Republican administration before Trump during President George W. Bush&#x2019;s term. Days out from the election, Tatus shares the mindset of America&#x2019;s undecided that both campaigns have spent millions of dollars and traveled thousands of miles across the country trying to reach. The 22-year-old Manhattan banker and Ukrainian citizen is not only undecided about who he hopes wins on Nov. 5, but he&#x2019;s also limited in his power to make an impact. He can&#x2019;t vote. After completing four years of undergraduate studies in the U.S., the Kyiv-born numbers cruncher isn&#x2019;t convinced his long-term future is in the U.S., so he hasn&#x2019;t bothered with citizenship. Anton Tatus in New York City, US, on Oct. 24, 2024. Tatus left Kyiv at the end of the Trump presidency and is unsure when he&#x2019;ll return to Ukraine. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)He left Kyiv at 16 years old with a dream to work on Wall Street. Now that most nights are spent wide-eyed in Microsoft Excel for work, he&#x2019;s questioning when he could go back to Ukraine, if he can. The stakes are high for this Ukrainian citizen. During the next U.S. presidential administration, he will turn 25, the conscription age for the Ukrainian military, which means if he does return to Ukraine, he would be eligible for the draft. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know who I want to win. It&#x2019;s a very complicated question (for) a Ukrainian citizen &#x2026; someone who cares for Ukraine, I&#x2019;d probably have a controversial answer,&#x201D; Tatus says. &#x201C;I think Trump might be potentially better for Ukraine than Kamala, which I know doesn&#x2019;t align with the consensus view on this topic.&#x201D; Despite believing that neither Harris nor Trump could end the war immediately, Tatus reserves a touch of hope for Ukraine in Trump&apos;s uncertainty. &#x201C;Trump is a wild card. I don&#x2019;t think he himself knows what he&#x2019;s going to do. I think it&#x2019;s going to be fully dependent on who he appoints as secretary of state and defense.&#x201D; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#x201C;Kamala, in terms of her foreign policy on Ukraine, it will be just an extension of the Biden Administration. We&#x2019;ll get some aid but barely enough to survive.&#x201D; Despite the widespread expectation that Harris will continue Biden&#x2019;s approach to Ukraine, some view her broader candidacy as too progressive. If it were 2020, Tatus says he&#x2019;d hands down be a Biden supporter. Like other Ukrainians who can&#x2019;t vote, his perception of the nominee&#x2019;s platforms would be less single-issue focused on foreign policy if he was a citizen. &#x201C;If I was an American citizen, I wouldn&#x2019;t be so confident in Trump, it becomes very complicated, it becomes fifty-fifty.&#x201D; Demkiw has spent the last few months selling Ukraine to American investors. The Ukrainian Canadian from Kyiv has worked in Kyiv and New York for a venture capital startup investing in Ukrainian technology. She wishes she had the citizenship to vote and the time to canvas for Harris. Knowing some Americans won&#x2019;t vote at all is as infuriating as knowing those who will vote for Trump, Demkiw says. Once Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion began in early 2022, Demkiw&#x2019;s once-moral opposition to Trump grew to include foreign policy concerns as she began to see through her venture capital work how American Democrats as a party tended to back Ukraine more than Republicans.

(Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;In terms of Trump versus (Harris) on Ukraine, I think neither one guarantees anything but Trump&#x2019;s action is worse than (Harris&#x2019;s) potential inaction,&#x201D; Demkiw says. &#x201C;While (Harris) might not be able to convince Congress to pass aid, at least she&#x2019;ll be open to the idea of Ukrainian victory. Trump had two opportunities to express (interest in Ukrainian victory) during the presidential debate and did not.&#x201D; Although she doesn&#x2019;t subscribe to the Trump-supporting view of some Ukrainians, Demkiw understands the thinking of many who arrived in America after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The equation of the Democratic party to communism, the appeal of capitalism, the promise of the American dream, and upward mobility that Trump sells to his base are elements Demkiw says she speaks to some Ukrainians planning to vote for Trump vote on Nov. 5. &#x201C;Trump will ride on the victory of wiping America&#x2019;s hands of the Ukraine war; that&#x2019;s enough for him, so it&#x2019;ll be a rapid ceasefire and no extension into NATO.&#x201D; &#x201C;The future of my country lies in this election.&#x201D; Lytvynova is nearly 5,000 miles away from the front lines of Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, where her partner is serving in the Ukrainian military. Because of this, the New York resident is much more in touch with how decisions in the White House impact Ukraine&#x2019;s front line. When Russia first invaded Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern Donbas region in 2014, Lytvynova fled the steel-producing city of Alchevsk, where she was born. Ten years on, she works for a U.S. media monitoring startup focused on Ukraine that looks at narratives around her home country. Prior to her relocation to New York in the fall of 2024, Lytvynova says the image of the Democratic party abroad that she was told to expect is one of liberal &#x2018;wokeism&#x2019; and anti-family values, none of which have proven to be accurate she says. She&#x2019;s concerned that some in the right-leaning international media present the Democratic party as somewhat &#x201C;anti-everything Ukraine stands for right now,&#x201D; which she says is not true. &#xA0; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure who I would vote for. I don&#x2019;t think I would vote for Trump, but I&#x2019;m not sure I would vote for (Harris) either,&#x201D; says Lytvynova, who does not have citizenship and thus can&#x2019;t vote.

With her partner serving on the frontlines in Ukraine, Lytvynova will feel the impact at home if the next presidency backs down from supporting the Ukrainian military. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;But I still think she could do better in explaining what she really means behind those ambiguous &#x2018;let&#x2019;s not turn back&#x2019; phrases,&#x201D; Lytvynova says, referencing Harris&#x2019;s campaign phrases similar to &#x201C;when we fight, we win,&#x201D; that often serve as reference to Trump-era turmoil or as crowd pleasers. Lytvynova says a vote for Harris is the choice between two evils. Too many people are putting trust in Trump&#x2019;s word that he&#x2019;ll end the war in Ukraine in a day, she says. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think that is the case.&#x201D; And if reporting from acclaimed Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward is true that Trump has been speaking with Putin repeatedly, Lytvynova asks why hasn&#x2019;t he done anything about the war he claims he&#x2019;ll have immediate authority over. &#x201C;Both parties will continue the same approach. They will give some money, and they will fund us a little bit, but they will not give us enough to have a turning point in the war.&quot; Trump&#x2019;s unpredictability is terrifying, Ordynat says, but so too is the fear of isolation that a Harris White House could bring to Ukraine. The 23-year-old public health professional, from Rivne in Ukraine&#x2019;s west is worried Harris will continue President Biden&#x2019;s policies toward Ukraine of delaying and limiting aid based on fears of escalation. Ordynat feels defeated by her inability to vote and frustrated by the reality that not every eligible voter exercises their right to do so. If she could, she&#x2019;d vote for Harris. The vice president is reasonable and predictable, she says. &#x201C;The elections are making me feel uneasy for the future of Ukraine. I believe both presidential candidates have made a lot of promises to Ukraine but haven&#x2019;t necessarily upheld them in the past,&#x201D; Ordynat says.

However, I&#x2019;m still a little scared of her candidacy as well because sometimes her approach lacks strength with the situation in Ukraine. We&#x2019;re just prolonging something inevitable.&#x201D; Ordynat says that while Harris has made it obvious she stands with Ukraine, she fears she will continue to give Ukraine only some aid but without taking an aggressive enough approach to end the war. Despite a distaste for Trump, she&#x2019;s not surprised that some Ukrainians in the U.S. support Trump. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re conservative in their nature.

US announces new military aid package worth $425 million	Washington announced on Nov. 1 a new military aid package for Kyiv worth $425 million, according to a U.S. Defense Department press release. The day prior, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a joint press conference that the U.S. would &quot;soon&quot; provide Ukraine with another aid package in light of North Korean troops&apos; involvement in Russia&apos;s war. The recent military assistance is provided under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) which pulls weapons from U.S. stocks. The aid list includes munitions for NASAMS missile systems, Stinger missiles, ammunition for HIMARS rocket systems, tube-launched, optically tracked, and wire-guided (TOW) missiles, Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems, as well as 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition. Washington will also provide Kyiv with air-to-ground munitions, Stryker armored personnel carriers, counter-unmanned aerial systems (c-UAS) equipment and munitions, some medical equipment, and spare parts, among other contents of the package. The U.S. recently allocated another military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Kyiv on Oct. 21. Austin had arrived in Kyiv unexpectedly to discuss further support as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Concerns are growing that if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris, he may withdraw or reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, potentially forcing the country into painful concessions. Despite U.S. assistance, Russian forces continue grinding forward in eastern Ukraine, while the country braces for renewed strikes against its energy grid as winter approaches. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 30 said the U.S. has transferred to Ukraine nearly 10% of the $61 billion aid approved by Congress in April 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-new-military-aid-package-worth-425-million/	2024-11-01T11:45:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1996073809-1.jpeg

Russian missile strike on Kharkiv kills 1, injures 30	Russia carried out an attack on Kharkiv on Nov. 1, killing a police officer and injuring at least 30 other people, local authorities reported. Two missiles hit a police station, killing police officer Andrii Matvienko. Twenty-six police officers and four civilians were injured in the attack, Kharkiv regional police reported. Russia used either Iskander-M or S-300/S-400 missiles to strike the city, according to preliminary data. The two explosions sounded at close to 4 p.m. local time. The strikes damaged 14 residential buildings, as well as heating and water supply networks, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Emergency services are continuing to clear the rubble, under which there may be more victims, according to local authorities. The northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless Russian attacks over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. In recent months, Moscow has intensified aerial strikes, often targeting densely populated neighborhoods. A Russian attack on Oct. 28 damaged the Derzhprom building (the State Industry Building), a historic landmark that has been under enhanced UNESCO protection since 2022. Russia on Oct. 30 attacked a residential neighborhood in the city of Kharkiv late in the evening, killing a man and two boys aged 12 and 15, and injuring 36 others.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-strike-on-kharkiv-kills-1-injures-30/	2024-11-01T11:29:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-01-19_42_26.jpeg
Russia seizes more territory over past week than at any point in 2024, Bloomberg reports	Russia has seized more territory in its war with Ukraine over the past week than at any point in 2024, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 1, using Bloomberg Intelligence calculations based on the DeepState map service that tracks battlefield changes in coordination with Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry. In recent months, Russian troops carried out a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses. Russia has captured 1,146 square kilometers (442 square miles) in Ukraine since Aug. 6, about a quarter more than in the first seven months of the year, the media outlet said. The Russian military also advanced by 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) over the past week, Bloomberg reported. As Russia makes gains on the battlefield, Ukrainian officials are growing more despondent about the future course of the war, according to one official close to President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s office who spoke to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, according to Estonian intelligence, Moscow has seized 150 square kilometers (58 square miles) in the Donetsk sector of the front line over the past week. Russian troops have reportedly captured the town of Selydove, but Ukraine has not yet confirmed the reports. Bloomberg said Russia&apos;s next targets are the towns of Poskovsk and Kurakhove, important logistical hubs for the Ukrainian military. Observers and the Ukrainian military have previously warned of an increasingly difficult situation in the town as Russian forces have been pushing forward over the past few weeks. The Ukrainian military said on Oct. 29 that it had repelled 11 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, including near Selydove.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-seizes-more-territory-over-past-week-than-at-any-time-in-2024-during-same-period-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-01T10:16:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168107584.jpg
North Korean troops could suffer even greater losses in Ukraine than Russia, Estonian intelligence says	North Korean troops are likely to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine, potentially exceeding those of Russia, Estonian Colonel Ants Kiviselg, head of the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center, told the Estonian public broadcaster ERR on Nov. 1. The first North Korean soldiers were deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast in late October, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported earlier. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. North Korean soldiers are usually trained to fight in mountainous terrain, which means they are not familiar with Ukrainian territory, its climate, and geography, Kiviselg said. &quot;Their training does not include combat operations in such conditions, and the training they receive in the Russian Federation is certainly not of a very high level,&quot; Kiviselg said. &quot;Therefore, we can expect North Korean units to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine, and probably even more than the Russian Federation&apos;s forces have suffered so far.&quot; He said that the North Korean troops arrived in Kursk Oblast in &quot;early October,&quot; having previously undergone two to four weeks of training. Following this, North Korean soldiers redeployed to the &quot;Ukrainian front,&quot; Kiviselg added. &quot;The arrival of North Korean soldiers on the Ukrainian front will likely take place in stages,&quot; Kiviselg said. &quot;If this additional deployment of (North Korean) units in Russia, their training, and then arrival on the Ukrainian front continues in the long term, it could certainly bring some changes to the front line.&quot; Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, according to U.S. intelligence. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, citing communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Russian forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-troops-could-suffer-even-greater-losses-in-ukraine-than-russia-estonian-intelligence-suggests/	2024-11-01T09:14:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg
Ukrainian Defense Ministry's chief inspector fired	Admiral Ihor Voronchenko has been dismissed from the post of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry&apos;s chief inspector, online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported on Nov. 1, citing the ministry. The Main Inspectorate of the Defense Ministry audits the ministry&apos;s activities, including monitoring the quality of military training and staffing, overseeing military aviation safety, and conducting technical investigations, among other functions. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov signed the order to dismiss Voronchenko on Oct. 31. The ministry did not provide any reasons for Voronchenko&apos;s dismissal. It is not yet known who will replace Voronchenko. In September, controversial lawmaker Mariana Bezuhla said that Umerov had allegedly fired Voronchenko after his report on military training centers at a meeting of the headquarters of the supreme commander-in-chief. The admiral&apos;s report was very critical and allegedly &quot;angered&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Bezuhla said. Yet this information has not been confirmed by any official. In 2003, Voronchenko began serving in the Ukrainian Navy. He was in Crimea when Russia invaded and illegally annexed the peninsula in 2014. At that time, he served as a deputy commander of the Navy. Voronchenko was the chief commander of the Navy from 2016 to 2020, after which he was appointed inspector of the Defense Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/admiral-voronchenko-dismissed-as-chief-inspector-of-defense-ministry/	2024-11-01T08:28:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2154777749.jpg
Russia not advancing in Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, contact line stabilized, Ukraine says	Russian troops are not advancing in the embattled towns of Chasiv Yar and Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast, and the contact line has been stabilized, spokesperson for the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk Anastasia Bobovnikova, said on Nov. 1. Speaking on national television, Bobovnikova refuted Russian claims that the two towns had been captured by Moscow&apos;s forces. Toretsk and Chasiv Yar have become one of the hottest spots in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. &quot;At the moment, they do not have an advantage in these towns. The contact line is stabilized,&quot; Bobovnikova said. According to the spokesperson, Russian troops have not crossed the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal in Chasiv Yar, but are moving there in small groups trying to gain a foothold. &quot;The purpose of such actions is to accumulate as much as possible before the attack. However, such attempts are detected by our drones and are targeted,&quot; she added. The Donetsk Oblast city of Chasiv Yar has been partially under Russian control since Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July, establishing the Siverskyi Donets &#x2013; Donbas Canal as the new front line. Kyiv controlled roughly 40-50% of Toretsk as of mid-October, while Russia had captured the remainder. The loss of Toretsk and Chasiv Yar would be another blow to Ukraine in Donetsk Oblast after its forces were forced to withdraw from Vuhledar in the south early last month. Russian forces also continue pushing toward Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Toretsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-has-no-advantage-in-chasiv-yar-toretsk-contact-line-stabilized-kyiv-says/	2024-11-01T07:05:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2167352745.jpg
Opinion: Accessibility in Ukraine remains elusive as Russia’s war reveals systemic failures	As of June, more than 50,000 Ukrainians have lost one or more limbs in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, and more than 3 million people&#x2014;10% of the population&#x2014;live with a disability. In theory, Ukraine has a legislative framework to protect people with disabilities and ensure their inclusion in society. In practice, however, outdated infrastructure and prevailing social attitudes still uphold significant barriers three years into the full-scale invasion. Modern residential complexes, sleek shopping centers, and trendy restaurants are common in Kyiv, but Soviet-era public infrastructure is still pervasive. Ubiquitous underground crosswalks with long staircases, apartment buildings, government offices, stores, cultural centers, and even the subway remain largely inaccessible. In the Soviet Union, people with disabilities were often viewed as expendable burdens&#x2014;if they were acknowledged at all. After World War II and well into the transition years of the 1990s, people with disabilities were largely confined to their homes: transit was inaccessible, elevators often broke down, and wheelchairs and prosthetics were impractical and scarce. Despite the millions of amputee veterans who returned from World War II, the state saw no reason to invest in accommodations to help them reintegrate into society. Instead, veterans with visible limb loss were considered &#x201C;uncomfortable&#x201D; reminders of the war, incompatible with the Soviet vision of postwar industrialization. The state even went so far as to ban people with disabilities from higher education through a secret decree. &#x201C;There are no invalids in the USSR!&#x201D; was the official response at the 1980 Moscow Olympics when Western journalists asked whether Paralympians would compete. Through forced erasure, an entire population was made invisible. Although conditions have greatly improved since Ukraine&#x2019;s independence, significant challenges persist. Simply moving around Ukrainian cities remains challenging as even basic accessibility features&#x2014;like ramps&#x2014;are not common. The few that do exist are often too steep, too narrow, or blocked by generators or merchandise displays, rendering them useless. Oleksandr Budko (callsign &#x201C;Teren&#x201D;), a veteran of the Carpathian Sich 49th Infantry Battalion who has experienced double limb loss, is a public figure, activist, and Season 13 Bachelor contestant. Both Budko and &#xA0;Yevhen Syvoplias, a veteran and activist, have been using their respective social platforms to highlight the barriers facing wheelchair users across Ukraine. Their videos capture everything from curbed sidewalks to unreachable call buttons for assisted entry, broken wheelchair lifts, and the indifference of many passersby. &#x41F;&#x435;&#x440;&#x435;&#x433;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x43D;&#x443;&#x442;&#x438; &#x446;&#x435;&#x439; &#x434;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441; &#x432; Instagram &#x414;&#x43E;&#x43F;&#x438;&#x441;, &#x43F;&#x43E;&#x448;&#x438;&#x440;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x439; &#x425;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x1F48D;&#x441;&#x442;&#x44F;&#x43A; &amp; &#x425;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x442;&#x44F;&#x447;&#x43A;&#x430; (@holostyakstb) Ramps alone, however, are only a small part of the picture, says Oleksandr Bazylevych, a former drone operator with the 3rd Regiment of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces, who lost three limbs during an offensive outside Kupiansk in September 2023. In reality, many businesses with visible ramps fail to meet other essential needs&#x2014;such as wide enough entrances or accessible restrooms for wheelchair users. Dialogue and cooperation from business owners are critical to implementing structural changes that foster a more inclusive society. This would benefit not only wheelchair users but also parents with strollers, seniors, and others with limited mobility. Public transportation also needs an upgrade (and a dedicated city budget) as the subway and private mini buses, or &#x201C;marshrutky,&#x201D; are impossible for wheelchair users to navigate, leaving private taxis as the main&#x2014;and unaffordable&#x2014;option. Physical barriers aren&#x2019;t the only challenges for veterans with disabilities. A long-standing Soviet belief that people with disabilities cannot live independently continues to permeate society. Bazylevych says he is constantly asked by everyone from taxi drivers to train staff where his attendant is&#x2014;a frustrating assumption rooted in outdated notions of perceived helplessness. Although people often offer to help him navigate difficult situations, Bazylevych emphasizes that universal accessibility must be a priority: &#x201C;Accessibility is important, because objectively-speaking, there are many people who require it. I don&#x2019;t need any special entitlements, I just want to work and live my life. Society as a whole needs to change its perception of people with disabilities because we can work, we can earn money, we just need conditions that allow this to happen. These (structural) changes only need to be instituted once, it&#x2019;s not a years-long process&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t need much, just the possibility to get around freely and have access to the basics.&#x201D; Against the backdrop of war, projects promoting visibility, destigmatization, and inclusion are creating a blueprint for true accessibility in Ukraine. One such project is Kurazh, a popular cultural and social event in Kyiv that combines lectures and performances with curated local brands. Known for its focus on tolerance and inclusivity, Kurazh has raised over 50 million hryvnias with the help of 750,000 guests over the past decade.

(Yuriy Dyachyshyn / AFP via Getty Images)Recently, the festival has included a booth for the Superhumans rehabilitation and prosthetics center, sign language interpreters, accessible parking, photo exhibits of people with facial differences, wheelchair-friendly children&#x2019;s playgrounds, and more. Kurazh&#x2019;s founders say their commitment to accessibility began in 2016 when they defined accessibility as synonymous with freedom, their most valued principle. Each small step brings Ukraine closer to a barrier-free society and a new socio-cultural definition of &#x201C;normal.&#x201D; Fight For Right, an organization taking a service-based approach, organizes evacuations for people with disabilities (who face additional obstacles compared to able-bodied people), advocates for legislative changes, and offers a braille studio, inclusive cinema, and inclusivity workshops and consultations for businesses and communities. Superhumans Center, Ukraine&#x2019;s most recognizable full-service rehabilitation and prosthetics center due in part to its large social media presence, goes beyond typical post-injury services. The center&#x2019;s team works daily to destigmatize disability through initiatives like Q&amp;A sessions for school-aged children, introducing them to diversity at a young age and teaching that difference is normal rather than something to fear. As a new generation grows up in a war-marked reality, there&#x2019;s hope that indifference and objectification will give way to genuine efforts to prioritize accessibility in a rapidly evolving society. When asked about his future, Bazylevych reflects on his life as someone who has lost three limbs and what he would say to those who question whether it was worth it: &#x201C;My future? I want to leave the military, continue to work and travel, meet new people, and widen my horizons. I would tell them that everything&#x2019;s okay in my life. I&#x2019;m a worthy citizen of my country; I did everything that I felt I needed to do. I have a job, I travel, I have friends, I have many positive and interesting things in my life&#x2014;everything&#x2019;s not so bad after all.&#x201D; Editor&#x2019;s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/opinion-accessibility-in-ukraine-remains-elusive-as-war-reveals-systemic-failures/	2024-11-01T06:50:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1258882273.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Minsk rushes with presidential election, seeking to hand Lukashenko a victory ahead of term's end	Belarus rushes forward with a presidential election, seeking to hand Alexander Lukashenko a victory six months ahead of the official term&apos;s end. In an interview, Lukashenko says North Korean troops fighting against Ukraine would be an &#x201C;escalation.&#x201D; Belarus and Russia to hold major joint military drills in September 2025. Belarus court sentences two Ukrainians to 20 years in prison for alleged terrorism. As Lukashenko claims willingness to consider pardon for opposition leader Maria Kalesnikava, human rights activists say her prison is known for widespread torture. The Belarusian Central Election Committee (CEC) on Oct. 29 registered an initiative group supporting the candidacy of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for the presidency, while rejecting applications to register groups for two other candidates. The move effectively allows Lukashenko to run for a seventh consecutive term in office unopposed. The election is to be held on Jan. 26, 2025. At the first CEC meeting, only Lukashenko&apos;s group received the registration necessary to start campaigning. Now, several more candidates were registered, all allies of Lukashenko and his regime. Aleh Haidukevich, leader of the pro-Lukashenko Liberal Democratic Party, said he is an active supporter of Lukashenko since 1994. Alexander Hizhnyak, leader of the pro-Lukashenko Republican Party, said &quot;Lukashenko is right choice for president.&quot; Another &quot;candidate&quot; is Olga Chemodanova, a former spokeswoman of the interior ministry, supported the suppression of protests and persecution of the opposition, saying that she supports the president in full. Belarus hasn&#x2019;t had free or fair elections since 1994, when Lukashenko came to power. The previous presidential election, which Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide with 80% of the vote, provoked nationwide protests and a subsequent regime crackdown on dissent. In the course of quelling the opposition, Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime eliminated independent media, closed over 1,700 non-profit civic organizations, banned all but four political parties loyal to the regime, and jailed over 1,300 political prisoners. In late October, the Belarusian parliament approved Jan. 26 as the date for the seventh Belarusian presidential elections, nearly half a year earlier than stipulated in the country&#x2019;s election legislation, and a month earlier than the previously rumored date of Feb. 23. The Belarusian Central Election Commission, led by Ihar Karpenka, justified bringing the election forward as necessary for kicking off the new &#x201C;five-year socio-economic development cycle&#x201D; with a &#x201C;re-elected&#x201D; leader. Some experts, however, attribute the rush to hold the election to Lukashenko&#x2019;s desire to secure his domestic political position ahead of potential negotiations over Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. RFE/RL political analyst Valer Karbalevich suggested Lukashenko may be eyeing a role in future peace negotiations, while analyst Alexander Friedman noted that the accelerated election could also be a preparation for a potential escalation of the conflict. Meanwhile, political analyst Artsiom Shraibman argues that the early election process is attributable to Lukashenko&#x2019;s desire to mitigate risks of unrest by holding it in the cold winter month of January. Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya denounced the election as a &#x201C;sham,&#x201D; accusing Lukashenko&#x2019;s administration of running a &#x201C;fake electoral process&#x201D; under an &#x201C;atmosphere of terror.&#x201D; In a joint statement with her shadow cabinet and the opposition&#x2019;s Coordination Council, Tsikhanouskaya urged her supporters to vote &#x201C;against all&#x201D; on the ballot in protest. Belarusian political analysts believe that while the proposed tactics won&#x2019;t stop Lukashenko from being reelected, they are the only possible and safe way for voters to register opposition to the authorities. Even though the opposition is campaigning for Belarusians to vote against all candidates, a member of Tsikhanouskaya&#x2019;s shadow cabinet, Yury Hubarevich, attempted to register as a presidential candidate. &#x201C;We must confirm with practical steps that no one but people approved by the regime will be able to participate in these elections,&#x201D; Hubarevich told Zerkalo.io, explaining why he was attempting to register. The current election legislation is stacked against the exiled Belarusian opposition: Only people who have been resident in Belarus for the past 20 years can register as presidential candidates, and they can hold no foreign residencies or citizenships. Most of the opposition activists also have convictions in politically motivated criminal cases, ruling them out as possible candidates for president. Russia has already backed Lukashenko&apos;s candidacy. &#x201C;We will definitely be following the developments of the election campaign very closely,&#x201D; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russia&apos;s state-run TASS. Earlier, Russia&#x2019;s Ambassador to Belarus, Boris Gryzlov, said Moscow will assist Minsk if there are &#x201C;attempts to destabilize the situation&#x201D; during the 2025 presidential elections in Belarus. As the election campaign nears, Belarusian police have tightened their control of former political prisoners and those sentenced to house arrest, the independent Belarusian media outlet Euroradio wrote. Lukashenko opponents are summoned to police stations and forced to sign a &#x201C;formal warning,&#x201D; prohibiting them from carrying out actions aimed at &#x201C;changing the constitutional order by force.&#x201D; In an interview with the BBC on Oct. 23, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko dismissed reports that North Korean troops have been deployed in Ukraine, saying that such a move would be &#x201C;a step towards escalation.&#x201D; &#x201C;Knowing his character, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would never try to persuade another country to involve its army in Russia&#x2019;s special operation in Ukraine,&#x201D; Lukashenko said, when the information about the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia was already confirmed by Kyiv and Soul. Hours later, the deployment was confirmed by Washington D.C. Lukashenko argued that the involvement of the armed forces of any other country would be a step towards escalation and prompt NATO to deploy its troops in Ukraine. &#x201C;Even if we (Belarus) got involved in the war, this would be a path to escalation. Why? Because you, the &#x2018;Anglo-Saxons,&#x2019; would immediately say that another country had become involved on one side... so NATO troops would be deployed to Ukraine,&#x201D; Lukashenko said. Russian propagandists commonly refer to the English-speaking countries, primarily the United States and the United Kingdom, as &#x201C;Anglo-Saxons.&#x201D; While being Russia&#x2019;s steadfast ally, Belarus has not sent its troops to the front line. However, the Russian military used Belarusian territory and infrastructure to stage its failed assault on Kyiv in the early days of the all-out invasion. In the interview, Lukashenko denied providing Belarus&#x2019;s territory for the attack. According to him, Putin had been withdrawing the troops from the Belarus-Ukraine border but &#x201C;was provoked&#x201D; to &#x201C;turn them&#x201D; on Kyiv. In reality, there was a months-long buildup of Russian troops in Belarus and in parts of Russia close to the Ukrainian border. Russian troops also attacked Ukraine from the south, and from the Russian-occupied Crimea. Lukashenko also denied being requested to commit his troops to the battlefield. &#x201C;Never. Neither he (Putin), nor (former Defense Minister) Sergei Shoigu, nor the current Defense Minister Andrei Belousov has ever raised that question.&#x201D; Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence agency, earlier said that the first North Korean units were expected to arrive in Kursk Oblast on Oct. 23. Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory there. Two North Korean brigades of up to 6,000 personnel each are currently undergoing training in Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. According to military intelligence, some North Korean officers are already in the occupied territories of Ukraine, Zelensky said on Oct. 17. North Korea has denied the reports, while the Kremlin&#x2019;s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov gave an evasive answer. Belarus and Russia will hold joint strategic military exercises in Belarus in September 2025, Belarusian Air Force and Air Defense Forces Commander Andrey Lukyanovich told Belarusian state-owned TV channel STV on Oct. 28. According to Lukyanovich, Russia and Belarus will conduct preparative &#x201C;operative-tactical exercises with live firing&#x201D; in 2025, leading to a &#x201C;joint strategic exercise&#x201D; in September 2025. The Air Force Commander did not name the exercise, yet the announcement comes on the heels of a meeting of the joint board of the Defense Ministries of the two states on Oct. 23, which approved the concept of the &#x201C;Zapad-2025&#x201D; joint strategic exercise of the armed forces without specifying the dates. The previous Zapad strategic exercise took place in 2021, involving 200,000 Russian and Belarusian troops, with approximately 12,800 hosted in Belarus. It was followed by another military drill, the &#x201C;Union Resolve 2022,&#x201D; which was actually a disguise for the buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border in late 2021 ahead of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A Belarusian court has sentenced Serhiy and Pavlo Kabarchuk, a father and son from Ukraine, each to 20 years in prison for allegedly organizing a terrorist act in Belarus, the Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta reported on Oct. 23. The two were detained on Feb. 15, 2024, after allegedly trying to smuggle weapons and explosives across the border of Belarus, helped by Ukraine&#x2019;s SBU security agency and State Border Guard Service. The next day, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko announced a successful &#x201C;counterterrorist operation,&#x201D; and a state TV channel aired footage of the Kabarchuks &#x201C;confessing,&#x201D; likely under duress, of working on the orders of the SBU. Ukrainian State Border Guard Service Colonel Andriy Demchenko dismissed the claims, saying, &#x201C;there is no end to Lukashenko&#x2019;s absurdity.&#x201D; The Kabarchuks&#x2019; trial started on Sept. 26 in the southern Belarusian city of Homiel. The charges against them included attempting to commit a terrorist act, the illegal handling of firearms and explosives, smuggling firearms across the border, and undercover activities. The Belarusian authorities said both the father and son cooperated with investigators. At least 12 Ukrainian citizens are held behind bars in Belarus on trumped-up charges, according to the Viasna Human Rights Group. The pressure on the Ukrainian community in Belarus has intensified since the all-out Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, in which Belarus sided with Russia and provided its territory for attacks on Ukrainian targets.

(Photo by Petras Malukas/AFP via Getty Images)Penal Colony No. 4 in the southern Belarusian city of Homiel, which houses prominent Belarusian political activist Maria Kalesnikava, uses torture against political prisoners, including placement in an outdoor cage on the territory of the colony, the International Committee for the Investigation of Torture. The report, presented on Oct. 22, includes testimonies from 20 political prisoners convicted after a crackdown on dissent in Belarus that followed protests against sham presidential elections held in 2020. All interviewed prisoners served their terms in Homiel&#x2019;s penal colony No. 4 between May 2021 to February 2024. &#x201C;One of the most heinous (punishments) is the cage located on the colony&#x2019;s territory at the checkpoint between the residential and industrial zones,&#x201D; the report reads. Women are reportedly placed in it for up to eight hours for refusing to comply with the demands of staff or for violent conflicts with other prisoners. Among the multitude of repressive tools in the colony, human rights activists highlight the blockade of communication with the outside world, being deprived of hygiene products and medical care, arbitrary punishments, the use of solitary confinement, and humiliating practices such as strip searches. Political prisoners face retaliation for their political views, according to Sergey Ustinov, the co-founder of the International Committee for the Investigation of Torture in Belarus. The committee is part of the International Accountability Platform of Belarus, a coalition of Belarusian and international human rights organizations documenting human rights violations by the Lukashenko regime. High-profile political prisoners like Kalesnikava are frequently subjected to solitary confinement, isolated from others, with fellow inmates forbidden from speaking to them. Kalesnikava, who led the campaign of presidential candidate Viktar Babaryka, who was in turn sentenced to 11 years in prison, has been held incommunicado for over 600 days since being admitted to intensive care with a severe medical condition that developed while she was in detention. In remarks to the BBC on Oct. 23, Lukashenko declared he was ready to consider Kalesnikava&#x2019;s plea for a pardon. He claimed her family hadn&#x2019;t been granted visits because &#x201C;they didn&#x2019;t want to visit her.&#x201D; Members of Kalesnikava&#x2019;s family, who are actively seeking her release, say she is malnourished, weighing 45 kilograms (99 pounds) while being 175 cm (5&#x2019;7&#x201D;) tall. They said prison food is unsuitable for her condition, and they report having no contact with her. Since July 2024, Lukashenko has released 115 out of the country&#x2019;s 1,300 political prisoners in four rounds of &#x201C;pardons&#x201D; while at the same time jailing more. Over July and August, human rights activists added 115 new names to Belarus&#x2019;s list of recognized political prisoners. On Sept. 16, that count rose again, with 22 new names added.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-minsk-rushes-with-presidential-election-seeks-to-hand-lukashenko-a-victory-ahead-of-terms-end/	2024-11-01T06:44:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2179663468.jpg
Poland's Sikorski hits back at Zelensky's MiG-29 fighter jets criticism	Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has responded to criticism from Ukraine over the slow supply of fighter jets, insisting on Nov. 1 his country has done more for Kyiv &quot;than any other nation.&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 31 said Ukraine is still expecting to receive Soviet MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland. &quot;We agreed with NATO that they would provide them (Poland) with a police mission, just like our Baltic friends, who do not have their own planes but have such a mission,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We agreed on this, but after that, did Poland give us the planes? No. Was there another reason? Yes,&quot; he added without providing further details. In response, Sikorski told Polish journalists that taking into account &quot;military, financial, economic, humanitarian [assistance], and the assistance for Ukrainian refugees, Poland has done more for Ukraine in terms of GDP than any other nation.&quot; He added there are &quot;almost 300 of our tanks, a lot of heavy equipment, and planes across the eastern border.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re trying to help, but we&apos;re also a front-line country. Russia also threatens us, and not everything is possible,&quot; he added. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees. The country has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Ukraine to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. Yet, bilateral relations are far from perfect, with the two countries sharing long-standing grievances that are far from being resolved.	https://kyivindependent.com/polands-sikorski-hits-back-at-zelenskys-mig-29-fighter-jets-criticism/	2024-11-01T06:41:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2172451145.jpg
Russia's Lavrov reportedly to make first visit to EU country since launch of full-scale invasion of Ukraine	Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to visit Malta this December to attend the Organization for Security and Cooperation Ministerial Council (OSCE) meeting, the ministry&apos;s spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Vedomosti newspaper on Oct. 31. If the visit takes place, it will be Lavrov&apos;s first trip to an EU country since the launch of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The last time Lavrov visited an EU country was in 2021, when he traveled to the OSCE meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. He also visited &#xA0;the U.N. General Assembly in New York several times during Moscow&apos;s all-out war. While both the EU and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Lavrov in February 2022, they did not impose a travel ban as the EU and U.K. wanted to keep open diplomatic channels with Russia. According to the Maltese embassy in Russia, the decision to hold the meeting of OSCE&apos;s Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for Dec. 5-6 &quot;applies to all [its] members, including the Russian Federation,&quot; the Russian newspaper wrote. In 2023, Lavrov attended the OSCE summit in North Macedonia, which sparked a rift among the OSCE members, leading to a boycott of the meeting by foreign ministers of Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states. The OSCE was formed in the 1970s as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which provided a platform for dialogue between the Eastern Bloc and Western Bloc during the Cold War.	https://kyivindependent.com/lavrov-reportedly-to-visit/	2024-11-01T06:12:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
Opinion: Pennsylvania’s Ukrainian community has a huge stake in the US election	I am one of more than 120,000 Pennsylvanians of Ukrainian heritage who will vote on which presidential candidate best serves our interests. Since only 80,000 votes separated the presidential candidates in 2020, our community&apos;s vote could be key to deciding who wins Pennsylvania&apos;s 19 electoral votes in November: Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. I have a personal stake in Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked war against Ukraine. Just days after the full-scale invasion began, I discovered I had five distant relatives in Ukraine, so I flew there to rescue them. What I saw in their eyes was the same blank, deer-in-the-headlights stare of Holocaust survivors when they were liberated. I realized at that moment I was there to do more than just get my relatives out. Since then, my wife, Ellen, and I have developed a network of &#x201C;angels&#x201D; who have helped thousands of refugees leave Ukraine, provide financial support, and settle in Pennsylvania, other states, and nations. After watching news of the full-scale invasion, Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a green light by calling his strategic decisions &#x201C;savvy&#x201D; and &#x201C;genius.&#x201D; When Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last month, he promised to strike a &#x201C;rapid deal&#x201D; to end the war but provided no details. He reportedly said privately that he could end the war by pressuring Ukraine to surrender some territory. Trump has also claimed Ukraine was &#x201C;demolished&#x201D; and that &#x201C;the people are dead.&#x201D; In his debate with Vice President Harris, Trump twice refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war. In response, members of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Polish community, veterans, social workers, small business owners, and several elected officials signed a letter last month endorsing Harris and vilifying Trump. &#x201C;Vice President Harris has a long, strong track record of protecting our democracy here at home and standing up for our brothers, sisters, parents, and grandparents in Poland&#x2014;the same people Vladimir Putin hopes to attack next if Ukraine were to fall,&#x201D; the letter read. &#x201C;Polish people in the U.S. and around the world know that our future is tied to Ukraine because if Putin is allowed to trample Ukraine, we know his next target could be Poland. Trump bowed to dictators like Putin before and he will do it again if he is reelected.&#x201D; Equally disturbing, Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance said, &#x201C;I gotta be honest, I don&#x2019;t really care what happens in Ukraine, one way or the other.&#x201D; In contrast, when Harris met with Zelensky last month, she pledged to continue robust U.S. support if she is elected president. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the Biden-Harris administration has allocated nearly $175 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine. Additionally, the administration created the &#x201C;Uniting for Ukraine&#x201D; refugee program, allowing Ukrainians to come to the U.S. and work legally immediately upon arrival, but only if an American sponsor is willing to support them financially. Since its launch, more than 236,000 cases have been approved, with 187,000 Ukrainian refugees already in the U.S. The resettlement of Ukrainian refugees has been relatively smooth, but their legal stay under humanitarian parole expires every two years. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees have settled efficiently in American communities with minimal controversy, including about 4,500 in Pennsylvania. Those who come to the U.S. under Uniting for Ukraine require an American sponsor willing to assist them financially, and they can work legally immediately upon setting foot on U.S. soil. For decades, America led the world in refugee admissions in a program that enjoyed wide bipartisan support. But Trump dramatically cut the refugee program. By the time he left office in January 2021, fewer than 12,000 refugees from all other countries combined were admitted to the U.S. in his last year. Imagine the hardships tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the war would face without a safe haven in America if Trump is elected president again. Unlike Donald Trump, Kamala Harris recognizes that America and other democracies worldwide have a moral and geopolitical interest in preserving the safety of the Ukrainian people, not just ensuring their survival but enabling them to thrive. I urge my fellow Pennsylvanians and Ukrainian Americans to elect her president.

Poland starts fortifying border with Russia's Kaliningrad exclave as part of 'East Shield' initiative	Poland has started building defensive lines on the border with Russia as part of the &quot;East Shield&quot; initiative, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Nov. 1. Presented this May, the &quot;East Shield&quot; program aims to fortify Poland&apos;s borders with Belarus, and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. It includes a mix of new physical barriers, modern surveillance systems, and infrastructure development. The program is part of NATO&#x2019;s eastern flank joint regional defense infrastructure plan that Poland is carrying out with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Warsaw allocated a total of 10 billion z&#x142;oty ($2.5 billion) to strengthen the borders with Russia and Belarus to deter aggression. &quot;This is the largest operation to strengthen Poland&#x2019;s eastern border, NATO&#x2019;s eastern flank, since 1945,&quot; Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said in spring. Kaliningrad Oblast is a small piece of land measuring 15,100 square kilometers &#x2014; not much larger than the U.S. state of Connecticut &#x2014; sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. It has a short, western coastline on the Baltic Sea. Its capital is also called Kaliningrad. Though it may be small, strategically it gives Russia a second point of direct access to the Baltic Sea, the other being through its most eastern arm in the Finnish Gulf. Russia&apos;s Baltic Sea Fleet has its headquarters and main base in Kaliningrad Oblast. The map of the Baltic Sea region. (The Kyiv Independent)The Suwalki Gap is the closest point between Kaliningrad Oblast, and one of Russia&apos;s staunchest allies, Belarus. It&apos;s a mere 40 kilometers wide and closely tracks the Poland-Lithuania border on the Polish side. In the event of a war between NATO and Russia, Russian and Belarusian forces linking up across the Suwalki Gap would cut off the only land route to all three Baltic States. In May, Tusk said that Poland had begun strengthening its entire eastern border with Belarus due to a growing &quot;hybrid war&quot; and illegal migration. &#xA0; Warsaw for several years accused Belarus of deliberately pushing migrants into Poland in order to pressure the EU over sanctions, a charge Minsk has denied. Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine has sparked concerns that the Baltic states, which are among Moscow&apos;s biggest critics and Kyiv&apos;s staunchest allies since day one of the all-out war, could become the next target for aggression. These fears are reinforced by Russian leader Vladimir Putin&apos;s repeated threats to NATO countries.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-starts-fortifying-border-with-russia-under-shield-east-program/	2024-11-01T05:22:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-01-133159.png
Russian drone strikes on Ukraine soared to record monthly levels during October, military says	Russia launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine during October, the General Staff reported on Nov. 1, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700. A total of 2,023 were recorded, according to the report. Of these, 1,185 were downed, 738 were &quot;lost,&quot; and 29 flew back out of Ukraine&apos;s airspace. No information was given about the remaining 71, but numerous strikes by Russian drones were reported during October, such as attacks that killed two people including a 15-year-old girl in Kyiv in recent days. According to the General Staff, Russia has launched a total of 6,987 strike drones since the start of the year, meaning 29% of them were launched during last month. The total number is significantly higher than September&apos;s previous record tally. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, 1,339 Shahed-type kamikaze drones targeted the country in September, 1,107 of which were shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare and flying into Russian or Belarusian airspace. Around 45 were unaccounted for with no further details given. Moscow has ramped up drone strikes, while dialing down the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. Experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said this may well be in preparation for an unprecedented mass attack rather than any sort of restraint from the Kremlin. &quot;UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles/drones) can be used as pathfinders,&#x201D; Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;A tool to force (an air defense) radar to light up, allowing the Russians to map the layout of defenses around Kyiv and other fairly well-defended cities.&quot; Kaushal and other experts warn that Moscow&apos;s reliance on drones over missiles is likely a sign of a particularly large aerial attack in the near future. &quot;It&apos;s been quite a while since we saw a large-scale missile strike, which worries me,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Part of this could relate to the fact they are ramping up not just for one or two mass strikes, but perhaps several more with the objective of fully disintegrating Ukraine&apos;s electrical grid within a short period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;It could also be to allow for comprehensive follow-on attacks after initial blows have been dealt to make sure it cannot be effectively repaired.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-strikes-on-ukraine-soared-to-record-monthly-levels-again-during-october/	2024-11-01T04:36:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Odesa.jpg
Trump says those who describe him as a 'friend of Russia' are 'sick'	Donald Trump has said those who consider him &quot;a friend of Russia&quot; are &quot;sick,&quot; in an interview with controversial far-right commentator Tucker Carlson in Arizona on Oct.31. &quot;They love to say that I was a friend of Russia. I worked for Russia, I was a Russian spy &#x2014; these people are sick,&quot; he said. According to journalist Bob Woodward&apos;s new book, Trump secretly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin as many as seven times after he left office. Trump has repeatedly backed and praised Putin and rarely criticized him. He described Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine as &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;savvy&quot; in 2022. Later, Trump blamed President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Joe Biden for Moscow&apos;s all-out war. In 2018, Trump accepted Putin&#x2019;s denial of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election over an assessment from his own intelligence services. The interview with Carlson comes less than a week before the U.S. presidential election, when Trump will face the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly said he could end Russia&apos;s war within 24 hours if elected president, without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. A recent article by the Financial Times (FT) claims that Trump aims to effectively freeze the war and reject Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership in the foreseeable future, at least &quot;until Putin leaves the stage.&quot; In an interview with Carlson, Trump claimed actions he took related to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline showed he wasn&apos;t friendly with Russia. Under Trump, the U.S. government &#xA0;imposed sanctions against Russian companies and the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. &quot;I killed. Nobody would kill it but me. I stopped it,&quot; Trump claimed.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-calls-sick-those-who-described-him-as-friend-of-russia/	2024-11-01T03:38:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181420636.jpg
Russian butter prices soar, rise in supermarket dairy thefts reported	The price of butter in Russia has soared nearly 25% since the beginning of 2024, Russian media reported on Oct. 31, prompting a spate of thefts in supermarkets across the country. Reuters reported that the price of one brand had risen by 34% since the start of the year and currently cost 239.96 roubles ($2.47). According to Russian independent news outlet Meduza, butter in some supermarkets is now packaged in the same anti-theft casings usually used for delicacies such as caviar and premium alcohol products. The move has been prompted by a rise in &#xA0;butter thefts, including one incident where two men were arrested after allegedly trying to steal 25 packets from a supermarket in Moscow. Surging government spending on war and defense production has seen Russia&apos;s economy shift to a war footing. Inflation in Russia has remained high throughout 2024, with the annual figure slowing to 8.63% in August, down slightly from 9.05% in August. To combat these pressures, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has kept interest rates high, now set at an unprecedented 19%. Increases in costs associated with wages, interest rates, fuel, and transport, have all contributed to the rising cost of butter. The situation is being closely followed in the Kremlin which has sought hard to ensure its war in Ukraine does not affect the day-to-day lives of its citizens at home. Speaking on Oct. 23, Dmitry Patrushev, a deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture, said the government was monitoring butter prices. Russia is also having to increase imports, with Meduza reporting that Turkey is now supplying butter to the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-butter-prices-soar-rise-in-supermarket-dairy-thefts-reported/	2024-11-01T02:04:26-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-500553344.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, injure 24 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed two people and injured 24 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Nov. 1. Ukrainian forces downed 31 out of 48 Shahed-type drones and other unidentified drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Fourteen more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; and three others flew towards Belarus, it added. Drone debris damaged several civilian enterprises, apartment buildings, and houses in Poltava, Cherkasy, Kyiv, and Odesa oblasts. Russian forces also reportedly fired three Kh-59/69 cruise missiles against Ukraine, with one of them shot down by air defenses. A Russian missile attack injured two first responders in the city of Odesa, damaging a fire station and cars, Governor Oleh Kiper said. A Russian attack on the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast killed a 75-year-old man, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Five more men and one woman were injured in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, and the settlements of Derhachi and Kucherivka. A 78-year-old woman suffered injuries after Russian attacks near Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Governor Serhii Lysak said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 19 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. One person was killed, and 13 were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Two people were injured as a result of Russian attacks on the town of Kurakhove and the village of Dronivka in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-103/	2024-11-01T01:47:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-01_09-38-56.jpg
Ukrainian drone targets oil depot in Stavropol Krai, Russian governor claims	A Ukrainian drone fell on the territory of an oil depot in the town of Svetlograd in Russia&apos;s Stavropol Krai overnight on Nov. 1, Governor Vladimir Vladimirov has claimed. According to Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry, Russian air defenses overnight shot down 36 drones over Kursk Oblast, 20 over Bryansk Oblast, 12 over occupied Crimea, eight over Voronezh Oblast, four over Oryol Oblast, and three over Belgorod Oblast. The Russian Baza Telegram channel posted a video purporting to show a drone exploding at the oil depot in Svetlograd. The town of Svetlograd has around 35,000 residents and lies over 600 (372 miles) kilometers southeast of Ukraine&apos;s border in Donetsk Oblast. No casualties or damage have been reported. Emergency services were at the scene, Vladimirov said. Alexander Bogomaz, Bryansk Oblast governor, claimed that a drone hit an apartment building in the city of Bryansk overnight, injuring one person. Kyiv has not commented on the reports, which cannot be verified independently. In recent months, Ukrainian forces have launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry, whose profits fuel Moscow&apos;s war efforts. A Ukrainian drone reportedly struck on Oct. 31 an oil refinery in the city of Ufa in Russia&apos;s Bashkortostan Republic, which lies some 1,500 kilometers from the country&apos;s border.	https://kyivindependent.com/svetlograd-drone-oil/	2024-11-01T00:30:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-01-091544-1.png

Over 45 countries pledge support at Montreal conference for the return of Ukrainian captives and deportees	Following the Ministerial Conference on the Human Dimension of the Peace Formula in Montreal, over 45 countries signed a pledge on Oct. 31 in support of facilitating the return of all Ukrainian captives and deportees. The theme of releasing prisoners and deportees was based on the fourth point of the Ukrainian Formula for Peace, It took place in Montreal, Canada, and was attended by representatives from approximately 70 countries and international organizations. The pledge that was signed outlines shared principles among participants, reaffirms strong support for Ukraine&#x2019;s victory, and condemns any nation aiding Russia&apos;s aggression. Key agreements include enhancing Ukraine&apos;s collaboration with international partners to address humanitarian issues and compliance with the Geneva Conventions, as well as identifying trusted mediating states for negotiations regarding the return of Ukrainian military personnel, civilians, and children. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha highlighted the conference&apos;s tangible outcomes, particularly commitments from specific countries to assist in returning children. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly noted that Qatar, the Vatican, South Africa, Lithuania, and the UAE have made specific pledges to aid in the return of deported individuals. Additionally, a coalition of countries will be formed to gather information about captured Ukrainians and assist in data verification. The conference participants also committed to supporting Ukraine in reintegrating those who eventually return, and raising awareness about Russia&apos;s unlawful detentions and deportations. Russian authorities and their collaborators have illegally deported thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied territories to Russia. At least 19,500 children have been confirmed as abducted by Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and less than 400 of them have been returned home, according to the Children of War database. Russia also holds thousands of Ukrainian prisoners of war, with 3,672 of them having been successfully brought back from captivity. The United Nations commission has published several reports describing the torture of Ukrainian POWs as &#x201C;widespread and systematic,&#x201D; and the conditions of their detention as &quot;shocking.&quot; Some Ukrainian POWs have died in captivity from causes such as &quot;blunt force trauma&quot;.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-45-countries-pledge-support-at-montreal-conference-for-the-return-of-ukrainian-captives-and-deportees/	2024-10-31T22:27:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1749110905.jpg
Negotiations between Ukraine and China underway to expand agricultural exports	Ukraine is currently in discussions with China to expand exports of various agricultural products, according to Oleh Osiian, the First Deputy Head of the State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumer Protection. Osiian noted that the intention is to establish seven new markets, and for Ukraine to export peas, wheat flour, livestock feed, beef, corn, poultry, and wild-caught aquatic products. The protocols for these exports are at different stages of development and approval, with the pea protocol nearing completion in Ukraine and awaiting consideration by Chinese authorities. Draft protocols for poultry and fish are also under review, while the protocol for wild-caught aquatic products has passed domestic approval and is pending final approval from China. Meanwhile, China&apos;s already robust economic ties with Russia have grown stronger since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Trade between Russia and China has surged by 121% since 2021, underscoring the Chinese role as Moscow&apos;s economic lifeline. China&#x2019;s official position on the war has been &#x201C;neutral,&quot; and Beijing has tried to play both sides in order to maximize economic benefit and increase geopolitical influence.	https://kyivindependent.com/negotiations-between-ukraine-and-china-underway-to-expand-agricultural-exports/	2024-10-31T20:02:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/W020240724564401152035.jpg
A war of two countries against one' — Zelensky urges Western allies to take decisive action on North Korean troop involvement	In a lengthy post on social media on Oct. 31, President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Western allies to develop &quot;concrete solutions&quot; to provide additional supports for Ukraine as North Korean troops prepare to engage Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast in late October in preparations to fight alongside Russian troops. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31 that at least 8,000 North Korean forces have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war. &quot;North Korean troops have not yet engaged in combat, but this is a matter of days, not months,&quot; Zelensky wrote in his post on X. &quot;When deployed, they will be pushed forward, sustaining heavy losses, as Russia tries to minimize its own troop mobilization.&quot; According to Blinken, Russia has been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones, and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they &quot;fully intend&quot; to use these forces in front-line operations. Urging Western powers to stand united behind Ukraine, Zelensky said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was &quot;testing the world&#x2019;s reaction&quot; with the influx of North Korean troops along the country&apos;s border. Zelensky&apos;s comments, made ahead of an interview on South Korean television, are aimed at encouraging allies, including South Korea, to reconsider their positions in light of the deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea. The statement comes as Kyiv prepares for a visit from a South Korean delegation seeking to share intelligence on North Korean soldiers and discuss mutual cooperation. &quot;We are particularly interested in South Korea&#x2019;s expertise in air defense and hope to collaborate further in the defense sector,&quot; Zelensky wrote. Yonhap news agency reported on Oct. 30, citing a senior South Korean presidential official, that the country is not currently considering directly providing 155 mm artillery shells to Ukraine. Experts previously told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition shells. Ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5, Zelensky also called on the next U.S. president to maintain the country&apos;s commitment to back Ukraine: &quot;The next U.S. president may strengthen or weaken support for Ukraine. If that support weakens, Russia will seize more territory, it would prevent us from winning this war,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;A genuine desire from the United States to end this war swiftly is crucial.&quot; While Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has criticized calls for concessions from Ukraine, Republican candidate Donald Trump has suggested that Ukraine could cede territory in exchange for peace. &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s territories are not negotiable. Our constitution doesn&#x2019;t allow us to abandon our rightful lands, regardless of Russia&#x2019;s claims or constitutional manipulations,&quot; Zelensky added. Amid increased military casualties and concern over the Russian public&apos;s reaction to domestic mobilization, Putin visited Pyongyang in June to ratchet up support for Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine &#x2014; signing a mutual defense pact with the country&apos;s dictator Kim Jung-Un. In his post, Zelensky called for new military alliances to emerge to counter the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. &quot;It may be time for an Asian Security Alliance,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Both Japan and South Korea are strong, civilized nations, and reaching out to China could be essential in countering North Korea&#x2019;s aggression, as North Korea is actively pulling that region into a war.&quot; U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has been urging China, which maintains relations with North Korea, to put pressure on Pyongyang to withdraw North Korean troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. &quot;I&#x2019;m surprised by China&#x2019;s silence. I can&#x2019;t say that China is on our side, but as a regional security guarantor, its silence is striking,&quot; Zelensky said on social media. Despite the urging of the United States, some Western officials are pessimistic about the country&apos;s ability to pressure China into helping pull back North Korean troops, with a NATO official telling CNN that China has been a &quot;critical enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. China&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s defense industry has played a significant role in shifting the battlefield momentum in Ukraine in Moscow&apos;s favor. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine On Oct. 24, China denied that it was of any North Korean troops inside Russia preparing to join Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite warnings from the U.S. and South Korea. As Ukraine continues to fight off Russian attacks along its easter front, it will soon be forced to fend off attacks from another aggressor &#x2014; as world leaders continue to deliver &quot;only bold political statements,&quot; and not concrete actions, Zelensky said. &quot;(Putin) is testing the West, NATO, and even South Korea, observing their response to North Korean forces joining his campaign. If the response is weak, we should expect the numbers of foreign soldiers on our soil to increase.&quot; Ukraine has said that North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. Despite North Korean troops not having any live combat experience, Zelensky argues that they are gaining &quot;invaluable combat experience, learning artillery, drone warfare, and modern combat tactics&quot; &#x2014; warning that what is happening in Ukraine may one day occur elsewhere. &quot;Consider how close North Korea is to Seoul&#x2014;just 40-50 km, the range of modern artillery, not even missiles,&quot; Zelensky wrote. &quot;Our own towns were obliterated by artillery. I hope South Korea never faces this, but preparation is critical.&quot; Fearing that little action will be taken to curb a major escalation in the war, Zelensky invoked memories of world leader&apos;s unwillingness to act to prevent an imminent full-scale war. &quot;When Russia invaded and occupied Crimea ten years ago, there was little global reaction, aside from a few quiet statements. It&#x2019;s the same today with North Korea&#x2019;s involvement,&quot; the president wrote. Despite Zelensky&apos;s outcry, some experts fear the damage has already been done. &quot;When North Korea began supplying Russia with artillery shells in late 2022, the West took no action. A year later, the first reports started to emerge of Russia launching North Korean ballistic missiles at Ukrainian targets,&quot; Peter Dickinson, an expert at the Atlantic Council wrote. Now, Ukraine not only has to contend with a Russian army that seeks to increase its fighting force by 180,000 troops, but a North Korean regime that gains &quot;military technologies and the invaluable experience of its people,&quot; Zelensky concluded.	https://kyivindependent.com/a-war-of-two-countries-against-one-zelensky-says-as-he-urges-decisive-actions-from-western-allies-on-north-korean-troop/	2024-10-31T18:07:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GbPXWpybwAAnmyl.jpg
Ukraine, Hungary preparing bilateral document 'to clear up misunderstandings,' Zelensky says	Kyiv is preparing a bilateral cooperation document with Budapest &quot;to clear up misunderstandings&quot; between the two countries on an number of issues, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 31. No information was provided on what specific agreements the bilateral document seeks to reach, however, Zelensky said that the document would likely involve issues pertaining to national minorities as well as security cooperation. &quot;The least we ask of Hungary is not to block Ukraine&apos;s invitation to NATO. That is, do not support, do not vote for us, and do not block,&quot; Zelensky said during a conference with community leaders in western Ukraine. Relations between Kyiv and Budapest have continued to sour as Hungary, led by strongman Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has repeatedly blocked aid to Kyiv, pushed for negotiations with Moscow, and spouted Kremlin talking points. On Oct. 17, Orban referred to Ukraine&apos;s five-point victory plan, which includes NATO accession atop of the list, as &quot;more than terrifying.&quot; In a socia media post, Orban urged the EU to change its strategy regarding the war in Ukraine and reiterated calls for &quot;a ceasefire and peace talks.&quot; &quot;There are many things there to clear up misunderstandings or to answer the challenges of the present, the future and the past,&quot; Zelensky said in regards to the document being prepared. Zelensky added resolving issues related to national minorities should be addressed &quot;so that no issues arise between our states.&quot; Budapest has repeatedly accused Kyiv of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority concentrated in southwestern Ukraine, an accusation that the Ukrainian leadership denies. The two countries have in recent months sought to mend relations on the issue. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Sept. 30 after talks with his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto in Budapest that both sides see &quot;positive dynamics&quot; in resolving issues related to national minorities, as reported by European Pravda. In September 2023, the Ukrainian parliament approved changes to national minorities law, which was one of seven steps recommended by the European Commission in June 2022 for Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union. The changes were signed into law by President Volodymyr Zelensky in November.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hungary-preparing-bilateral-document-to-clear-up-misunderstandings-zelensky-says/	2024-10-31T17:42:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/7c19fbac71d9006321d6f6e2b6c17459_1719918827_extra_large.jpeg
Ukrainian drone strikes Russian oil refinery 1,500 km from border, Russian official claims	A Ukrainian drone struck an oil refinery in the city of Ufa in Russia&apos;s Bashkortostan Republic, the head of the republic, Radiy Khabirov, said on Oct. 31. According to Khabirov, three Ukrainian drones fell within the facility of the oil refinery, with one falling on the refinery itself. The drone caused minimal damage with no casualties reported, Khabirov claimed. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the claims of the official and Ukraine has not yet commented on the alleged attack. The incident appears to be just the second time since the start of the full-scale invasion that Ukrainian drones attacked facilities in Bashkortostan which lies some 1,500 kilometers from the country&apos;s border. On May 9, a Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) source told the Kyiv Independent that a long-range drone operated by the SBU attacked the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat oil refinery. It was not immediately clear to which refinery the drone allegedly fell on during the most recent attack. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s oil industry beginning in the spring of 2024. The alleged strikes comes as Ukraine and Russia are reportedly holding preliminary discussions about stopping attacks on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29 &#x2014; although Russia has denied being involved in the talks. In a show of strength, Kyiv has regularly attempted to strike long-distance targets since the start of the war. In April, Ukraine hit production facilities in Russia&apos;s Tatarstan Republic, 1,300 kilometers away from the state border, while in September, Russian officials claimed that Ukrainian drones attacked targets in Murmansk Oblast, located behind the Arctic Circle. Ukraine&apos;s Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said in April that the country has domestically-produced attack drones capable of flying over 1,000 kilometers, as Kyiv intensifies its efforts to ramp up domestic production of drones. Fossil fuels are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Despite Western sanctions, Russia still provides oil and gas to other countries around the world, primarily India and China.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-drone-strikes-russian-oil-refinery-1-500-km-from-ukrainian-border-russian-official-claims/	2024-10-31T15:10:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/backfire.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia confirms North Korea's involvement in war to West, Kyiv says	Key developments on Oct. 31: Russia has confirmed to the West that North Korea is taking an active part in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the South Korean KBS TV channel published on Oct. 31. He said the messages were passed through the country&apos;s intelligence. &quot;The Russian Federation at the level of intelligence confirmed that North Korea is involved (in the war) ... (Russia) has been talking about this with the West.&quot; North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine and deployed them in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as the Pentagon, confirmed on Oct. 28. &quot;Two states are officially at war against Ukraine. The military is officially involved. This is not just the transfer of artillery shells, assistance with the appropriate number of missiles, or the involvement of technical personnel working at factories,&quot; Zelensky said. Some 3,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Meanwhile, Kyiv expects their number to increase to 12,000, Zelensky said. The president said that some of the North Korean military is also located in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories without specifying the region. There have been no clashes between the North Korean and Ukrainian military so far, but this is &quot;a matter of days, not months,&quot; according to Zelensky. &quot;Russia really wants us to leave Kursk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Russia has concentrated about 45,000 troops in Kursk Oblast and will increase (their number). They (Russians) are pulling North Korean troops there. They don&apos;t have enough.&quot; According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the troops and cite communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine this week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has also been urging China to use its relationship with Pyongyang and apply pressure on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war. Some 8,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to participate in the war against Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a press conference on Oct. 31. The first North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk Oblast in late October, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported earlier. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, according to HUR. There have been no clashes between the North Korean and Ukrainian military so far, Blinken said, adding that they can happen &quot;in the coming days.&quot; &quot;One of the reasons that Russia is turning to these North Korean troops is that it&apos;s desperate. (Vladimir) Putin has been throwing more and more Russians into a meat grinder of his own making in Ukraine. Now he&apos;s turning to North Korean troops, and that is a clear sign of weakness,&quot; Blinken said. Russia has been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones, and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they &quot;fully intend&quot; to use these forces in front-line operations, according to Blinken. &quot;Should these troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.&quot; Blinken added that the U.S. will announce more military assistance for Ukraine &quot;soon.&quot; The U.S. has transferred nearly 10% of the aid approved by Congress in April 2024 to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a press conference on Oct. 30. After months of political infighting and a worsening situation on the battlefield, the U.S. House of Representatives finally passed the foreign aid package on April 20, which included $60.84 billion in support for Ukraine. &quot;You do your job. You count on reserves, you count on special brigades, you count on such equipment. And if you get 10% of all the package (that) has already been voted on... It&apos;s not funny,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If you give your word, you have to keep it,&quot; he added, noting that Ukraine had planned its military actions relying on the promised assistance &quot;at a certain time.&quot; Zelensky also said NATO was not ready to take specific steps toward Ukraine&#x2019;s membership due to Russian aggression, but the alliance had promised to provide &#x201C;six or seven&#x201D; air defense systems to protect Ukraine&apos;s airspace. &quot;But today, we haven&apos;t received this number. If we still haven&apos;t received it and we can&apos;t count on this great support for air defense during the heating season, which has already begun in Ukraine... What can we do?&quot; The U.S. recently allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Kyiv on Oct. 21. Austin arrived in Kyiv unexpectedly to discuss further support as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Concerns are growing that if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris, he may withdraw or reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, potentially forcing the country into painful concessions. Despite U.S. assistance, Russian forces continue grinding forward in eastern Ukraine, while the country braces for renewed strikes against its energy grid as winter approaches. Ukraine is still expecting to receive Soviet MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 31. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in July that Warsaw may provide Kyiv with additional Soviet-made fighter jets if it can find a replacement. Following Zelensky&apos;s calls to speed up the transfer, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said, &quot;Poland makes decisions based on its security and has already done everything it can for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We agreed with NATO that they would provide them (Poland) with a police mission, just like our Baltic friends, who do not have their own planes but have such a mission,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We agreed on this, but after that, did Poland give us the planes? No. Was there another reason? Yes,&quot; the president said without providing further details. Zelensky added that Ukraine has &quot;constantly asked&quot; Poland to shoot down Russian missiles flying in its direction, particularly to protect the gas storage facility in the town of Stryi in Ukraine&apos;s Lviv Oblast, located nearly 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the Ukrainian-Polish border. &quot;We do not have the appropriate number of (air defense) systems to protect the gas storage facility. What about the Poles? Are they shooting it down? No. The Poles said we are ready to shoot down if we are not alone in this decision; if NATO supports us.&quot; Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine. Yet, Polish allies advised the government to exercise restraint when dealing with unidentified airspace violations, according to Tusk. In early July, Ukraine and Poland signed a bilateral security agreement, which included a commitment by both sides to examine &quot;the feasibility of possible intercepting in Ukraine&apos;s airspace missiles and UAVs fired in the direction of the territory of Poland, following necessary procedures agreed by the states and organizations involved.&quot; Then NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was skeptical about this point of the agreement, saying that it puts the alliance at risk of &quot;becoming part of the conflict.&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski began to insist on Poland&apos;s right to shoot down air targets after a Russian drone reportedly crossed the country&apos;s border in an attack against Ukraine on Aug. 26. The minister said that the risk of Polish casualties increases the closer a missile is to its target when intercepted, so it was better to shoot it down at a higher altitude over Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s proposed 2025 budget passed its first reading in parliament on Oct. 31, allocating approximately 26% of the country&apos;s GDP to defense and military spending. &quot;The priority of next year&apos;s budget will again be security and defense. All taxes paid by people and businesses will go toward strengthening our defenders and military capabilities,&quot; Prime Minister Denys Smyhal said on his Telegram channel. Military and defense spending will grow by Hr 46 billion ($1.6 billion) compared to 2024, reaching over Hr 2.2 trillion ($53.4 billion). According to Shmyhal, state spending will increase by Hr 535 billion ($13 billion) to Hr 3.6 trillion ($87.4 billion), while revenues are expected to reach around Hr 2.7 billion ($65.5 million), up Hr 411 billion ($10 billion) from 2024. &quot;Not a single amendment to meet the needs of the military, and those who today especially need state support, was taken into account,&quot; opposition lawmaker Dmytro Razumkov said, criticizing the document on his Telegram channel. Following today&apos;s discussions, the budget law will go through additional rounds of consideration before lawmakers hold a final vote, expected by Dec. 1. Ukraine&apos;s state budget has increasingly relied on external support, including war bonds, IFI loans, and bilateral loans and grants, as the country&apos;s war-torn economy falters. A widening annual budget deficit, reaching 20.6% in 2023, led Ukrainian lawmakers to approve a tax hike in September&#x2014;the first since the full-scale war began&#x2014;a politically unpopular move as the country seeks new sources of funding for its expanding wartime budget. Ukraine faces a $35 billion budget deficit next year, and with Russia&apos;s war continuing into its third year with no end in sight, the country must secure funding to sustain its economy and finance the war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-confirms-north-koreas-involvement-in-war-to-west-kyiv-says/	2024-10-31T13:35:16-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157775748.jpg

Russia's next mass missile attack on Kyiv likely imminent, experts and weary residents say	Russia&apos;s aerial attacks against Kyiv have changed dramatically in recent weeks, becoming far more frequent yet far less destructive. Moscow has ramped up drone strikes on the capital &#x2014; which overnight on Oct. 31 was attacked for the 20th time this month &#x2014; and the rest of the country, while dialing down the use of more powerful and harder-to-intercept cruise and ballistic missiles. The last combined mass missile and drone attack on Kyiv was nearly two months ago. While on the surface, this may seem like a positive development, for the capital&apos;s residents, it is stirring up a sense of unease. &quot;I think this is a target practice before winter,&quot; 32-year-old Kyiv school teacher Zakhar Shevchuk told the Kyiv Independent &quot;I think there will be missiles, drones &#x2014; everything combined because there have been no missiles for a long time, but there are a lot of drones.&quot; This photograph shows smoke billowing from the International Academy of Personnel Management following a missile attack in Kyiv, Ukraine on Sep. 2, 2024 (Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)Residents stay outside an apartment block in the Solomianskyi district hit by a Russian drone attack in Kyiv, Ukraine on Oct. 25, 2024. A girl born in 2009 was killed and at least five people were injured. (Serhii Chuzavkov / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Ukrainian officials have for months been warning of a renewed effort by Russia to destroy the country&apos;s energy infrastructure after a series of devastating strikes between March and August of this year severely damaged many of the country&#x2019;s thermal power plants, and grid connection of generation from hydroelectricity producers. The country, as a result, is heavily dependent on power produced by nuclear power plants as well as imports. &quot;The winter will be the hardest of the last three years,&quot; the interim head of Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo, Oleksiy Brekht, said in an interview with Suspilne on Oct. 29. He added that if Russia continues its onslaught of attacks against critical energy infrastructure as it did last winter, then Ukrainians may face up to eight hours of power outages on the most &quot;critical&quot; days. According to a report by the Financial Times (FT), Kyiv and Moscow are holding preliminary discussions about stopping attacks on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure after earlier talks fell through following Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. A senior Ukrainian official cited in the report said energy infrastructure attacks have already decreased in the past few weeks, based on a deal established through Ukraine and Russia&#x2019;s respective intelligence agencies. Moscow has denied the reports of negotiations. An energy worker walks through a destroyed control room at a DTEK power plant in an undisclosed location in Ukraine on April 19, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images)Liubov Bondar, 75, a retired worker at a maritime shipping company, told the Kyiv Independent that even if the negotiation reports were accurate, they would not be effective. &quot;Can we really trust (Russian President Vladimir) Putin?&quot; she asked, adding: &quot;He doesn&apos;t like the fact that our guys are hitting oil refineries. &quot;I don&apos;t believe him &#x2014; whatever he says, he will lie.&#x201D; While the number of missiles Russia has launched against Ukraine has dropped dramatically since the last mass attack on Sept. 2, the number of kamikaze drones has surged to unprecedented levels. September was the first month since the start of the full-scale invasion that Ukraine was attacked by Shahed-type drones every single day, with more than 1,300 being launched. This has only escalated during October, with the month&apos;s total surpassing September on Oct. 23. The vast majority are shot down, with some others being jammed by electronic warfare. An infographics showing the number of Russian missiles and drones launched against Ukraine during 2024 (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)&quot;The attacks have increased. It&#x2019;s bad, but it is what it is,&quot; said 44-year-old Olena Syrotina, who has lived in Kyiv since 2015 when she was forced to flee Luhansk after Russia&apos;s 2014 invasion of Ukraine. &quot;Now I can even hear (the drone&#x2019;s) buzz in my apartment. Before this month, it had never happened. &quot;I sleep, but when air defenses are shooting, and the light flashes in my windows, I wake up and go to the corridor.&quot; Syrotina is right to be cautious &#x2014; two people including a 15-year-old girl have been killed in the capital in recent days. Though drones have inflicted far less damage than some of Russia&apos;s mass missile strikes, experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said this may well be in preparation for an unprecedented mass attack rather than any sort of restraint from the Kremlin. &quot;UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles/drones) can be used as pathfinders,&#x201D; Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;A tool to force (an air defense) radar to light up, allowing the Russians to map the layout of defenses around Kyiv and other fairly well-defended cities.&quot; Kaushal and other experts warn that Moscow&apos;s reliance on drones over missiles is likely a sign of a particularly large aerial attack in the near future. &quot;It&apos;s been quite a while since we saw a large-scale missile strike, which worries me,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Part of this could relate to the fact they are ramping up not just for one or two mass strikes, but perhaps several more with the objective of fully disintegrating Ukraine&apos;s electrical grid within a short period of time,&quot; he said. &quot;It could also be to allow for comprehensive follow-on attacks after initial blows have been dealt to make sure it cannot be effectively repaired.&quot; Oleksandr Kharchenko, the managing director of the Energy Industry Research (EIR) Center, told the Kyiv Independent that making any predictions about Russia&apos;s next mass missile attack on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure is virtually impossible. &quot;We can&apos;t say for sure what objects will be attacked, how it will be attacked, or how effective the air defenses will be in this situation,&quot; he said. But he added that attacks on Ukraine&apos;s energy generation would have a more significant impact than attacks on the country&apos;s power grid. Last month in New York, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the U.N. Security Council that Russia was preparing to target three Ukrainian nuclear power plants. A few days earlier, Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Russia&apos;s possible targets include open distribution devices at nuclear power plants and transmission substations &quot;which are essential for the safe functioning of the nuclear energy system.&quot; According to Kharchenko, an attack on Ukraine&apos;s nuclear sites would lead to a &quot;very, very complicated situation.&quot; The cooling towers of the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant are seen in Varash, Ukraine on March 25, 2022. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post via Getty Images)There are three operating nuclear power plants on the Ukrainian-held territory &#x2014; Rivne and Khmelnytskyi NPPs in the country&apos;s west, and Pivdennoukrainsk NPP in the south. Kharchenko said they account for &quot;55-60% of electricity consumption.&quot; &quot;If a nuclear station&apos;s switchyard was attacked, damaged, or destroyed, it would be very painful,&quot; he said. &quot;And if you lose even one station from the grid, it means that you have lost it for three or four weeks because restoring the switchyards takes this long to repair.&quot; Guessing when the next big attack will occur is currently a pastime of experts and citizens in the capital. &quot;Well, first of all, you have to ask the Russians because they are absolutely out of common sense logic,&quot; Kharchenko said when asked when he thinks it might be. Several Telegram channels monitor the activities of Russian bomber aircraft based at airbases used to attack Ukraine. One of the latest reports noted a significant number massing at various airbases, adding to speculation in Kyiv of a possible imminent attack, but still with no clear conclusions. &quot;I watch the news, I watch different analysts (to hear) their predictions because no one fully knows what&apos;s in (the Russians&apos;) heads,&quot; said Shevchuk, the Kyiv school teacher. Weather forecasts are also closely followed because, as Kkarchenko explains, attacking Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure when the temperatures drop would likely cause more damage and more detrimental effects to the country&#x2019;s economic stability and war efforts. &quot;It&apos;s absolutely possible that they&apos;re really waiting for freezing cold temperatures,&quot; he said. Increased demand in colder weather would place much more significant strain on a damaged system, leading to more blackouts and restrictions, according to Kharchenko. &quot;It&apos;s also more complicated to repair something when you have freezing temperatures,&quot; he added. All that is left for Kyiv&apos;s residents is to prepare as best they can. Large generators have appeared on streets all over Kyiv as shops, restaurants, and bars take measures to ensure they can stay open during blackouts. Countless smaller systems have appeared in homes across the capital. &quot;I&apos;m expecting blackouts,&quot; 28-year-old Alina Malynovska told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I have a battery and an inverter. It&apos;s like a home charging station for everything.&quot; But some Ukrainians see advantages to power cuts in colder weather. &quot;In winter, it will be a little better because we can keep food on the balcony,&quot; Bondar, the pensioner, said. &quot;(In summer) the food was spoiling in the refrigerator.&quot; Despite the trepidation about the upcoming winter, those living in Kyiv have grimly experienced such hardships. &quot;Somehow I lived through last winter,&quot; 45-year-old Yurii told the Kyiv Independent, adding: &quot;We&#x2019;ll survive this one too.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-next-mass-missile-attack-on-kyiv-likely-imminent-experts-and-weary-residents-say/	2024-10-31T12:27:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181049107.jpg
Russia carried out at least 36 double-tap strikes in Ukraine, killing over 100 people since 2022, report says	The Russian military carried out at least 36 double-tap strikes against Ukraine from the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 to August 2024, killing over 100 people, according to a recent report by Truth Hounds, a Ukrainian non-profit organization that documents and investigates war crimes. Twenty such attacks were carried out this year alone. A double-tap attack is an illegal military tactic in which an initial strike is followed by a delayed second strike, usually intended to kill or injure first responders who arrive at the scene and cause panic among the population. Russia has been using this tactic extensively in Ukraine and previously in Syria alongside Bashar al-Assad&apos;s government forces. According to Truth Hounds, their report confirms that Moscow deliberately uses double-tap attacks to hinder humanitarian aid efforts, with Russian propaganda framing the killing of Ukrainian first responders as justified. Truth Hounds verified 36 cases of Russian double-tap strikes, although the overall number of incidents displaying the characteristics of double-tap attacks exceeds 60. A map with the verified Russian double-tap strikes in Ukraine from&#x2028;February 24, 2022 &#x2014; August 31, 2024. (Truth Hounds)According to the report titled &quot;Cruelty Cascade: Examining the Pattern of Russian Double-Tap Strikes in Ukraine,&quot; Russian forces have dramatically increased the use of this tactic in 2024, with instances this year alone surpassing the verified cases from the previous two years combined. Over 100 people were killed in the 36 double-tap attacks, verified by Truth Hounds, but it is unclear how many of them died as a result of the secondary strikes, Roman Koval, the organization&#x2019;s head of research, told the Kyiv Independent. In July 2024, Andrii Danyk, the head of Ukraine&#x2019;s State Emergency Service, reported that 93 emergency workers had been killed and almost 400 injured since the start of the full-scale invasion, though not all of these casualties had resulted from Russia&apos;s double-tap attacks. Russian double-tap strikes wounded nearly 350 civilians from April 2022 to April 2024, said Timothy Hanway, the acting U.S. envoy to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), in an address on April 25. Hanway also highlighted that Russia&apos;s usage of this illegal tactic had been increasing. &#xA0; Since 2014, Truth Hounds has been documenting and investigating international crimes and severe human rights violations across Ukraine and other conflict zones in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Their latest report delves into the pattern and impact of Russian double-tap strikes in Ukraine, offering a legal assessment of these actions and their implications.

(Ivan Samoilov/Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)In collaboration with the White Helmets &#x2014; a humanitarian organization focused on helping communities prepare for, respond to, and rebuild after attacks in Syria &#x2014; Truth Hounds established &#x201C;a strong connection&#x201D; between Russia&apos;s use of double-tap attacks in Syria and Ukraine, according to the organization&#x2019;s press release. In July 2023, the White Helmets reported having lost over 300 volunteers in the Syrian war, with the majority killed in double-tap attacks. In an earlier comment for the Kyiv Independent, Janine di Giovanni, a human rights reporter and investigator with over 30 years of experience working in war zones, called Russian double-tap attacks &#x201C;a part of a larger strategy of punishment and control,&quot; noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x201C;has a pattern of attacking civilians indiscriminately.&#x201D; Truth Hounds suggested in the report that the rise of Russian double-tap attacks in 2024 could be linked to the appointment of a new commander of the Russian Missile Troops and Artillery, along with a new head of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry. &#x201C;This fact warrants further investigation to uncover the underlying interdependencies, including potential shifts in operational strategy or tactical priorities under their leadership.&#x201D; The report also assesses the conditions under which double-tap strikes could be considered war crimes. These attacks violate the provisions of the Rome Statute, which explicitly forbids intentional targeting of civilians, and violate the article protecting medical and humanitarian personnel from attacks. &quot;Our research has thoroughly demonstrated that even if the first strike targets a legitimate military target, the second strike &#x2014; typically delayed and aimed at rescuers and wounded personnel &#x2014; crosses the line of legality, transforming these actions into war crimes,&quot; said Yuriy Uhryn, a lawyer at Truth Hounds, in a press release shared by the organization. Based on the report, Truth Hounds outlined a set of recommendations for the Ukrainian and foreign governments, international organizations, and the International Criminal Court. These include investigating Russian double-tap strikes in both Ukraine and Syria, increasing support for Ukrainian and Syrian first responders, promoting public condemnation of these war crimes, and advocating for stronger sanctions against Russia. &#x201C;The current situation highlights a critical pattern: impunity for international crimes tends to facilitate their recurrence, placing civilians in increasingly precarious positions,&#x201D; Truth Hounds said in a statement. &#x201C;The absence of effective measures to address such violations undermines international norms and emboldens those who commit these acts.&#x201D; Ukrainian authorities recorded almost 140,000 war crimes committed by Russian troops in the country, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the United for Justice conference in Kyiv on Sept. 11. Slightly over 100 people were found guilty of war crimes as of late March, most of them in absentia, according to Zmina, a Ukrainian human rights organization. Truth Hounds believes it&#x2019;s crucial to continue investigating Russian double-tap attacks and prosecuting the perpetrators. &#x201C;People who lost their loved ones to such attacks or were directly affected by them demand justice, and even if this demand can be satisfied only partially through sentences in absentia, it is still worth doing,&#x201D; said Koval. &#x201C;Russian suspects in war crimes still travel abroad, and such cases are not isolated. Considering that war crimes do not have a statute of limitations, this also significantly increases the chances of their arrest when they leave Russia sooner or later.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-carried-out-at-least-36-double-tap-strikes-in-ukraine/	2024-10-31T12:13:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2079435110-2.jpg
Kyiv won't stop supporting wartime pool of TV channels before martial law ends	The Ukrainian government doesn&apos;t plan to stop supporting the telethon, Ukraine&apos;s state-run pool of TV channels created during wartime, before the end of the martial law, Interfax Ukraine reported on Oct. 31, citing Culture Minister Mykola Tochytskyi. The comment comes after the European Commission criticized the telethon on Oct. 30, urging Kyiv to restore a &quot;pluralistic media landscape.&quot; Tochytskyi said Ukraine &quot;has taken into account&quot; the European Commission&apos;s recommendations. Brussels expects Ukraine to restore the work of all broadcasters in the pre-war format, questioning the telethon&apos;s objectivity. One of the European Commission&apos;s criticisms concerns the financing of the telethon from the state budget. &quot;We have already begun the path of change: step by step, we are ensuring that every citizen has access to public information and are actively engaging the resources of international partners to support the restoration of Ukrainian media,&quot; Tochytskyi said. The European Commission&apos;s recommendations have been &quot;taken into account,&quot; he went on. &quot;The state plans to stop supporting the telethon after the end of martial law, focusing on the sustainable development of media infrastructure.&quot; The so-called telethon, branded as &quot;Yedyni Novyny&quot; (&quot;United News&quot;), was launched at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. It was created by merging the coverage of Ukraine&apos;s biggest TV channels. The telethon was initially seen as a legitimate response to Russia&apos;s aggression, but later, it was accused of monopolizing television coverage and stifling dissent. Some opposition television channels have complained that they were excluded from the telethon due to their political stance. Suspilne, a Ukrainian public broadcaster, said on May 21 that it had launched its own news broadcasting on the Pershyi nationwide TV channel separate from the telethon. Mykola Chernotytskyi, the head of Suspilne&apos;s Managing Board, clarified later that the company de jure remains part of the telethon but will no longer be represented in its time slots. Prior to that, Suspilne&apos;s Supervisory Board Chairwoman Svitlana Ostapa said on Facebook that Suspilne was being pulled out from the telethon&apos;s prime-time evening slots.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-wont-stop-supporting-wartime-pool-of-tv-channels-before-martial-law-ends/	2024-10-31T11:54:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2053129369.jpg
Kyiv still waiting for MiG-29 fighter jets from Warsaw, Zelensky says	Ukraine is still expecting to receive Soviet MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 31. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in July that Warsaw may provide Kyiv with additional Soviet-made fighter jets if it can find a replacement. Following Zelensky&apos;s calls to speed up the transfer, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said, &quot;Poland makes decisions based on its security and has already done everything it can for Ukraine.&quot; &quot;We agreed with NATO that they would provide them (Poland) with a police mission, just like our Baltic friends, who do not have their own planes but have such a mission,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We agreed on this, but after that, did Poland give us the planes? No. Was there another reason? Yes,&quot; the president said without providing further details. Zelensky added that Ukraine has &quot;constantly asked&quot; Poland to shoot down Russian missiles flying in its direction, particularly to protect the gas storage facility in the town of Stryi in Ukraine&apos;s Lviv Oblast, located nearly 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the Ukrainian-Polish border. &quot;We do not have the appropriate number of (air defense) systems to protect the gas storage facility. What about the Poles? Are they shooting it down? No. The Poles said we are ready to shoot down if we are not alone in this decision; if NATO supports us.&quot; Russian drones and missiles have previously entered Poland&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine. Yet, Polish allies advised the government to exercise restraint when dealing with unidentified airspace violations, according to Tusk. In early July, Ukraine and Poland signed a bilateral security agreement, which included a commitment by both sides to examine &quot;the feasibility of possible intercepting in Ukraine&apos;s airspace missiles and UAVs fired in the direction of the territory of Poland, following necessary procedures agreed by the states and organizations involved.&quot; NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, in turn, was skeptical about this point of the agreement, saying that it puts the alliance at risk of &quot;becoming part of the conflict.&quot; Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski began to insist on Poland&apos;s right to shoot down air targets after a Russian drone reportedly crossed the country&apos;s border in an attack against Ukraine on Aug. 26. The minister said that the risk of Polish casualties increases the closer a missile is to its target when intercepted, so it was better to shoot it down at a higher altitude over Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-still-waiting-for-mig-29-fighter-jets-from-warsaw-zelensky-says/	2024-10-31T11:25:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177157663.jpg
Russia confirms North Korea's involvement in war to West, Zelensky says	Russia has confirmed to the West that North Korea is taking an active part in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with the South Korean KBS TV channel published on Oct. 31. He said the messages were passed through the country&apos;s intelligence. &quot;The Russian Federation at the level of intelligence confirmed that North Korea is involved (in the war) ... (Russia) has been talking about this with the West.&quot; North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine and deployed them in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, as well as the Pentagon, confirmed on Oct. 28. &quot;Two states are officially at war against Ukraine. The military is officially involved. This is not just the transfer of artillery shells, assistance with the appropriate number of missiles, or the involvement of technical personnel working at factories,&quot; Zelensky said. Some 3,000 North Korean troops are already in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Meanwhile, Kyiv expects their number to increase to 12,000, Zelensky said. The president said that some of the North Korean military is also located in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories without specifying the region. There have been no clashes between the North Korean and Ukrainian military so far, but this is &quot;a matter of days, not months,&quot; according to Zelensky. &quot;Russia really wants us to leave Kursk Oblast,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Russia has concentrated about 45,000 troops in Kursk Oblast and will increase (their number). They (Russians) are pulling North Korean troops there. They don&apos;t have enough.&quot; According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the troops and cite communication issues with their Russian counterparts as the main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has also been urging China to use its relationship with Pyongyang and apply pressure on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk Oblast has dramatically gained pace in recent days. Analysts say Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-confirms-north-koreas-involvement-in-war-to-west-zelensky-says/	2024-10-31T09:51:24-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Ukraine has received just 10% of US aid approved by Congress earlier this year, Zelensky says	The U.S. has transferred nearly 10% of the aid approved by Congress in April 2024 to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a press conference on Oct. 30. After months of political infighting and a worsening situation on the battlefield, the U.S. House of Representatives finally passed the foreign aid package on April 20, which included $60.84 billion in support for Ukraine. &quot;You do your job. You count on reserves, you count on special brigades, you count on such equipment. And if you get 10% of all the package (that) has already been voted on... It&apos;s not funny,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;If you give your word, you have to keep it,&quot; he added, noting that Ukraine had planned its military actions relying on the promised assistance &quot;at a certain time.&quot; Zelensky also said NATO was not ready to take specific steps toward Ukraine&#x2019;s membership due to Russian aggression, but the alliance had promised to provide &#x201C;six or seven&#x201D; air defense systems to protect Ukraine&apos;s airspace. &quot;But today, we haven&apos;t received this number. If we still haven&apos;t received it and we can&apos;t count on this great support for air defense during the heating season, which has already begun in Ukraine... What can we do?&quot; The U.S. recently allocated a new military assistance package for Ukraine worth $400 million, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Kyiv on Oct. 21. Austin arrived in Kyiv unexpectedly to discuss further support as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Concerns are growing that if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins against Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris, he may withdraw or reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, potentially forcing the country into painful concessions. Despite U.S. assistance, Russian forces continue grinding forward in eastern Ukraine, while the country braces for renewed strikes against its energy grid as winter approaches.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-received-just-10-of-us-aid-approved-by-congress-earlier-this-year-zelensky-says/	2024-10-31T08:45:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177959215-1.jpg
Ukraine’s 2025 budget clears first reading, allocates $53 billion for defense	Ukraine&#x2019;s proposed 2025 budget passed its first reading in parliament on Oct. 31, allocating approximately 26% of the country&#x2019;s GDP to defense and military spending. &#x201C;The priority of next year&apos;s budget will also be security and defense. All taxes paid by people and businesses will go toward strengthening our defenders and military capabilities,&#x201D; Prime Minister Denys Smyhal said on his Telegram channel. Military and defense spending will grow by Hr 46 billion ($1.6 billion) compared to 2024, reaching over Hr 2.2 trillion ($53.4 billion). According to Shmyhal, state spending will increase by Hr 535 billion ($13 billion) to Hr 3.6 trillion ($87.4 billion), while revenues are expected to reach around Hr 2.7 billion ($65.5 million), up Hr 411 billion ($10 billion) from 2024. &#x201C;Not a single amendment to meet the needs of the military, and those who today especially need state support, was taken into account,&#x201D; opposition lawmaker Dmytro Razumkov said, criticizing the document on his Telegram channel. Following today&#x2019;s discussions, the budget law will go through additional rounds of consideration before lawmakers hold a final vote, expected by Dec. 1. Ukraine&#x2019;s state budget has increasingly relied on external support, including war bonds, IFI loans, and bilateral loans and grants, as the country&#x2019;s war-torn economy falters. A widening annual budget deficit, reaching 20.6% in 2023, led Ukrainian lawmakers to approve a tax hike in September&#x2014;the first since the full-scale war began&#x2014;a politically unpopular move as the country seeks new sources of funding for its expanding wartime budget. Ukraine faces a $35 billion budget deficit next year, and with Russia&#x2019;s war continuing into its third year with no end in sight, the country must secure funding to sustain its economy and finance the war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-2025-budget-clears-first-reading-allocates-53-billion-for-defense/	2024-10-31T07:33:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1770835562.jpg
National Bank of Ukraine leaves interest rates unchanged at 13%	The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has kept interest rates on hold at 13%, it announced on Oct. 31. The decision was in line with analysts&#x2019; predictions, and comes as Ukraine braces for next week&#x2019;s U.S. presidential election, Bloomberg reported. &#x201C;Given that inflation has not yet peaked, and that pro-inflationary risks have even increased for the coming months, the NBU believes it appropriate to remain cautious,&#x201D; the NBU said in a statement. Policymakers refrained from cutting for the third consecutive month, part of an attempt to contain accelerating annual inflation, and uphold the stability of the domestic currency. &#x201C;In September, inflation accelerated to 8.6% year-on-year, and continued to rise in October,&#x201D; the NBU said in its statement. Higher than expected inflation was caused by a smaller than expected harvest, a weakening currency, and the rising cost of electricity and labor, the statement said. &#x201C;The war continues. Accordingly, the risks of a further decline in economic potential remain, in particular due to the loss of people, territories, and production facilities,&quot; it added. &#x201C;The speed of the economy&apos;s return to normal will depend on the nature and duration of the war.&#x201D; Ukraine&apos;s economy is heavily reliant on U.S. aid, and the next week&apos;s presidential election and the possibility of Donald Trump&apos;s return to the White House raises much uncertainty. The NBU said it envisages maintaining rates at 13% until the summer of 2025. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 12 December 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-central-bank-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-at-13/	2024-10-31T07:20:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/GettyImages-1401596737.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill at least 9, injure 47 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least nine people and injured at least 47 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Oct. 31. Russia launched at least 50 drones overnight, of which Ukrainian air defenses shot down 17 across various regions, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said on Oct. 31. Two X-59/69 missiles were also downed. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russia attacked a residential neighborhood in the city of Kharkiv late in the evening on Oct. 30, killing a man and two boys aged 12 and 15, and injuring at least 35 others. A Russian attack left a 14-year-old boy in the city of Dnipro with leg injuries, Serhii Lysak, head of the regional administration, said on his Telegram channel. In Donetsk Oblast, four people died in Uspenivka, Zarichne and Berestki, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. At least two injuries were reported in Shcherbynivka and Dalne. In Kherson Oblast, one person was killed and six others were injured following Russian strikes across the region targeting a library, an office building, and residential buildings, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. In Sumy Oblast&#x2019;s Khotinska village, Russian FPV drone strikes and mortar fire killed one civilian and injured three residents, the regional military administration reported. There were reports of strikes in Odesa, where Russia launched 10 missiles of various kinds, authorities said, though there were no reports of casualties.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-at-least-9-injure-48-over-past-day/	2024-10-31T05:20:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-31-14_14_35.jpeg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Ukraine debates who serves and who doesn’t	The following is the Oct. 30, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Companies in Ukraine that were expecting to be able to &#x201C;reserve&#x201D; their employees to shield them from military service might not be able to do so starting mid-November. The government in Kyiv said over the last week that it is currently doing an audit of the exemption process until Nov. 15 to assess which businesses qualify for &quot;critical enterprise status&quot; that allows them to keep some employees from having to serve. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has allowed some men of conscription age to be spared from conscription as a way of keeping strategic sectors, including the defense industry, afloat and to curb the toll Russia&#x2019;s war has taken on the economy. But as the war extends into its third year, Ukraine is struggling to mobilize enough soldiers to compensate for troop casualties and the need to rotate soldiers who have been fighting since 2022. It&#x2019;s a thorny issue in Ukraine, with some feeling it is unfair that others don&#x2019;t have to serve depending on their professions. It has also led to abuse of the system. Around 1.5 million people in Ukraine were exempt from military service in mid-August. President Volodymyr Zelensky is reportedly unhappy with how high that figure is, as well as the fact that the number almost doubled over a couple of months, an unnamed high-ranking official in the Presidential Office told NV, leading to the decision to carry out the audit. &quot;The reason for the audit is the abnormal increase in the number of critical enterprises and the number of reserved employees. This is done in the interest of strengthening the country&apos;s defense capability and preventing abuses,&quot; the Cabinet of Ministers said. The government also said over the weekend that employees in &#x201C;strategically important sectors of the economy&#x201D; who received an exemption from military service before May 31, 2024 would be able to extend that status. Stay tuned for more developments on this front.

(Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Naftogaz wins against RussiaA Finnish court ruled in favor of Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz to seize Russian assets in Finland worth tens of millions of dollars as part of a claim against Russia over its annexation of Crimea, Naftogaz said on Oct. 28. A tribunal in The Hague ordered Russia in 2023 to pay $5 billion to Naftogaz as compensation for assets illegally seized during the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014, but Russia had not yet done so. &quot;Since Russia refuses to voluntarily pay Naftogaz the funds stipulated by The Hague decision, we continue to use all available mechanisms to collect them. Today, we are one step closer to restoring justice,&quot; Naftogaz CEO Oleksii Chernyshov said following the Finnish court&#x2019;s decision. Finnish authorities began confiscating Russian state property on Oct. 28, the Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat reported, seizing the Russian Center of Science and Culture in Helsinki. Russia said it would challenge the decision in court, with Russian president&#x2019;s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov telling reporters that Moscow would &#x201C;use all legal mechanisms to protect our interests.&#x201D; Adnan Kivan. (Kadorr Group)Real estate mogul dies at 61Businessman Adnan Kivan, owner of the Kadorr Group and the English-language Ukrainian news outlet Kyiv Post, passed away on Oct. 28, the group said in a statement. The Odesa-based millionaire and investor of Syrian origin would have turned 62 in December. The statement did not specify the cause of death. The Kadorr Group is known mainly for its construction and real estate projects. In 2021, Forbes Ukraine listed Kivan as the 42nd richest person in Ukraine with a fortune of $240 million. His group was also involved in agriculture and media. Kivan purchased the Kyiv Post in 2018 from British-Ukrainian businessman Mohammad Zahoor. Conflicts over editorial independence with the newsroom led to Kivan suspending the Kyiv Post and firing the staff in November 2021.

(Alessandro Bremec/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Cash for everyoneLate last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s government made a decision that gave everyone Covid flashbacks &#x2014; that every Ukrainian, including children, would receive a one-time payment of Hr 1,000 (around $24) &#x201C;to support the population in winter.&#x201D; But wait, isn&#x2019;t Ukraine&#x2019;s budget and military starving for money? According to the government, the payments will come from funds provided to Kyiv by its international partners that need to be used up before the end of the year and can&#x2019;t be directed to the military. The money will only be able to be spent on things like utilities, medicine, transport, cell phone plans, buying Ukrainian books, and other various services. The government has also said people can donate their money to the army, if they wish. It&#x2019;s unclear yet how much in funds will be disbursed, but one deputy economy minister said that a similar move during the Covid-19 pandemic cost the government around Hr 8 billion, or nearly $200 million. &#x201C;The final amount of this program for three winter months will depend on the number of Ukrainians who want to use this program. It is not possible to name the final amount now,&quot; deputy minister Oleksiy Sobolev said. Those who &#x201C;don&#x2019;t want&#x201D; to use the program may not want to have to go through the trouble of opening the special account they would have to in order to receive the funds. There have been lots of reactions, to some wondering why the government isn&#x2019;t directing the funds to investments, or to to low-income families, to others wondering how it&#x2019;ll work logistically to get money to children and the elderly that don&#x2019;t have easy access to bank services. The government defended its decision, with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal saying that the move has three major goals: financially support Ukrainian families, activate domestic demand for Ukrainian services, and &#x201C;demonstrate the unity of Ukrainian society for our stability and victory.&#x201D; If you live in Ukraine &#x2014; especially in Kyiv &#x2014; you know first hand that 24 bucks doesn&#x2019;t get you very far at all. Personally, I suspect many people will donate their money to the military.

The FATF&#x2019;s decision to not blacklist Russia has instead again unearthed the lack of leadership among the West when it comes to curtailing Russia, Timothy Ash, a senior emerging market (EM) sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This should have been a slam dunk,&#x201D; he said.

Kernel &#x2014; one of Ukraine&#x2019;s largest agricultural holdings &#x2014; said in a post on Facebook that for the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion, it had received an $150-million loan from group of European banks, including Dutch commercial banks ING Bank and Co&#xF6;peratieve Rabobank, and the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank. The funds will be used to support operations aimed at increasing exports of Ukrainian agricultural products, including sunflower oil, the company said. The Group of Seven (G7) has reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets, the G7 announced on Oct. 25. &quot;Our aim is to begin disbursing the funds by the end of the year,&quot; a statement from the G7 leaders read. The new factory of German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, which opened in late October in Ukraine, is a &quot;legitimate&quot; target for Russian attacks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian pro-state news agency Ria Novosti on Oct. 29. The facility, which is already operating in Ukraine at an undisclosed location, is set to produce a batch of Lynx infantry fighting vehicles by the end of the year, according to Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger. The Transmission System Operators of Continental Europe will increase their export capacity to Ukraine and Moldova by 400 megawatts (MW) to 2.1 gigawatts (GW) starting Dec. 1, allowing Ukraine to rely more heavily on electricity imports this winter when blackouts are expected. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, destroying 9 GW worth of capacity on Ukraine&apos;s grid. &quot;Nuclear proliferation is the biggest risk mankind faces,&quot; JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said at an Institute for International Finance (IIF) event on Oct. 24. According to Dimon, the West has to have clarity and subordinate many things &quot;to make sure that this ends up right.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-business-roundup-ukraine-debates-who-serves-and-who-doesnt/	2024-10-31T03:58:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 152	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 152 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Oct. 13-24, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Updated IMF Memorandum. On Oct. 18, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published an updated Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) after its fifth review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Ukraine. Ukraine&#x2019;s key commitments related to state-owned enterprises and banks are as follows: As we wrote in Issue 116, foreign investors were interested in buying Ukrgasbank and Sense Bank. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. See Issue 146 for more detail. Currently, Roman Pionkowski is the only remaining independent member of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board. He was appointed together with other independent members in December 2021, meaning that his term of office is expected to expire in December 2024. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry, in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting, decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member will be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure, the ministry added back then. Three weeks later, the Economy Ministry said that the SOE Nomination Committee approved the candidate requirements and announced the competitive selection for three board members (see Issue 151). The selection of all board members &#x2014; four independent and three state representatives &#x2014; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. See Issues 129 and 151 for more detail. UDI gets a new CEO. On Oct. 21, Ukrainian Defenze Industry (UDI) announced that its supervisory board had appointed Oleg Gulyak as the company&#x2019;s new CEO, following a competitive selection process involving more than 20 applicants. As we wrote in Issue 146, UDI&#x2019;s CEO Herman Smetanin resigned on Sept. 4 to become the new minister for strategic industries, replacing Oleksandr Kamyshin. UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board then appointed Oleg Gulyak as acting CEO and announced that it would launch a competitive selection for the new CEO as soon as possible. According to UDI, Gulyak has served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 1993. In 2021-2024, he was the Commander of the Logistics Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since July 1, he has served as a military cooperation advisor to UDI&#x2019;s CEO, strengthening the company&#x2019;s ties with the Defense Forces. See Issue 146 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 148, on Sept. 19, UDI&#x2019;s supervisory board launched a competitive selection for the CEO position. Candidates could apply from Sept. 20&#x2013;Oct. 4. Naftogaz Group paid Hr 67 billion ($1.6 billion) in taxes in January-September 2024, the company&#x2019;s press office said on Oct. 16. This includes Hr 61 billion ($1.5 billion) paid to the state budget and Hr 5 billion ($121 million) in contributions to local government budgets. In September alone, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 5.8 billion ($140 million) in state taxes, including Hr 600 million ($14.5 million) in local ones. As we reported earlier, Naftogaz Group paid the following taxes to state and local budgets in the course of 2024: Month Taxes paid to state and local budgets SOE Weekly details &#xA0; UAH Euros* &#xA0; January 6.1 billion 147 million Issue 119 February 5.3 billion 129 million Issue 123 March 8.3 billion 197 million Issue 128 April 8.0 billion 189 million Issue 132 May 9.3 billion 215 million Issue 137 June 9.2 billion 203 million Issue 140 July 6.0 billion 132 million Issue 143 August 7.2 billion 174 million Issue 148 September 5.8 billion 129 million This issue * Converted at the National Bank of Ukraine&apos;s average exchange rate for the respective period. Calculations by SOE Weekly. As we reported in Issue 115, Naftogaz Group paid Hr 83.4 billion ($2 billion) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion ($164 million) to local government budgets in 2023. The Group said that it made Hr 23.1 billion ($559 million) in consolidated net profit in 2023, a significant rebound from its Hr 79.1 billion ($1.9 billion) loss in 2022. See Issue 131 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 149, Naftogaz Group made Hr 24.4 billion (&#x20AC;578 million at the average exchange rate over that period) in consolidated net profit in the first six months of 2024. Ukrhydroenergo cancelled a tender to procure lawyers to seek compensation for the destroyed Kakhovka HPP, the company&#x2019;s press office announced on Oct. 15. The company said that this decision was made to ensure that the company&#x2019;s actions are in line with Ukraine&#x2019;s broader national strategy. This strategy aims to hold Russia accountable for the damage caused to critical infrastructure and ensure compensation for the destruction. In this context, additional consultations with the Cabinet of Ministers and other key stakeholders will be held to determine the most appropriate course of action in line with the national approach coordinated with Ukraine&#x2019;s international allies, Ukrhydroenergo explained. On June 6, 2023 Ukrhydroenergo reported that the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP) was destroyed beyond restoration after the Russians set off a massive explosion in the engine room. See our Issue 91 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 135, on June 6, Ukrhydroenergo announced that it initiated an investment arbitration procedure with Russia to compensate for the damage caused by the destruction of the HPP. The preliminary estimate was about $2.5 billion. As we reported in August 2024 (Issue 143), Ukrhydroenergo announced a tender to procure lawyers. The tender was scheduled for Oct. 17. Its expected value was Hr 365 million ($8.8 million). Twelfth attempt to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port to be made. According to Prozorro.Sale, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) scheduled an auction for the sale of the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi trade seaport for Oct. 31. The starting price is Hr 178 million ($4.3 million). As we reported in Issue 148, in the previous attempt, the starting price was Hr 89 million ($2.1 million). It is unclear whether the asset whose starting price doubled will be able to attract bidders this time. This will be the twelfth attempt to sell the port. The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in March 2023 failed as no one registered. At the second auction, the seaport was sold for Hr 220 million (around &#x20AC;5.6 million at the time) to Ukrdoninvest LLC, a company owned by Ukrainian businessman Vitaliy Kropachov. However, Ukrdoninvest decided not to make the payment. As we reported in April 2023 (Issue 85), the company said that it backed out while hashing out the terms of the purchase agreement with SPFU&#x2019;s regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. In June 2023, SPFU announced that it would put Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi up for privatization for a third time, another attempt that failed (see Issue 93).&#x202F;In Issues 99 and 100, we reported about the following failed attempts to sell the port. As we wrote in August 2024 (Issue 144), former Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Viktor Dovhan posted on Facebook suggesting that Polish investors were considering participating in the privatization of the port. However, the ninth attempt to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi also failed (see Issue 147), as did the tenth and eleventh (see Issue 148). As we also wrote in Issue 147, according to CASE Ukraine, despite the attractiveness of the asset, there are no bidders because the port has debts of Hr 151.3 million ($3.6 million). The winner would also have to pay VAT of 20% of the purchase price. This suggested that, based on CASE Ukraine&#x2019;s information, the winning bidder would have to pay at least Hr 258 million ($6.2 million) in total. With the starting price now doubled, this would mean that the total amount to be paid for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi would amount to Hr 365 million ($8.8 million at the current exchange rate). For more detail, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 74, 78, 79, 84, 85, 87, 93, 99, 100, 144, 147, and 148. SPFU puts seized AEROC up for privatization. On Oct. 15, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the terms of privatization for construction materials producer AEROC, with a starting price of Hr 965 million ($23 million). The next day, the SPFU set the date of the privatization auction. It is scheduled for Dec. 18. As we wrote earlier, SPFU planned to privatise AEROC, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Andrei Molchanov. See our Issues 97, 100, 106, and 110 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 140, on July 12, the Cabinet added AEROC to the large-scale privatization list. According to Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) and PRO-Consulting, AEROC is one of the largest aerated concrete producers in Ukraine. The company owns two plants in Obukhiv and Berezan (Kyiv oblast), which have been out of operation since July 2022. The capacity of these plants exceeds 1 million cubic meters per year, while total aerated concrete production in Ukraine in 2020 was 4 million cubic meters. AEROC also has an unfinished plant in Stryi (Lviv oblast), EP added.

Opinion: Rigged elections have stolen Georgia's European future	In Georgia&#x2019;s 2012 election, then-President Mikheil Saakashvili&#x2019;s pro-Western party was defeated by Georgian Dream, a party led by the Russian-backed oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili. Though widely hailed at the time as a democratic triumph, astute observers warned against celebrating. One such observer was Georgia&#x2019;s former economy minister, the late Kakha Bendukidze, a businessman and philanthropist who wryly remarked that with Ivanishvili&#x2019;s victory, the country &#x201C;made a step forward in terms of democracy, but sometimes when you make a step forward, you step in shit.&#x201D; When friends who supported Georgian Dream in 2012 assured me they would vote the party out of power if it failed to deliver, I warned them that doing so would be far harder than they expected. Unfortunately, as Georgia&#x2019;s Oct. 26 parliamentary elections showed, my prediction was accurate. According to independent polling organizations like Edison Research, which conducted both pre-election and exit polls, Georgian Dream was soundly defeated by a coalition of four opposition parties. But as we celebrated our victory, the Central Election Commission (CEC) abruptly reported results giving Ivanishvili&#x2019;s party a lead that exceeded the exit-poll numbers by around 15%. Post-election fatigue quickly gave way to deep confusion and uncertainty. Although we had received numerous reports of polling issues and other legal violations throughout the day, the full extent of the government&#x2019;s electoral fraud became clear after the official results were announced. In the lead-up to the election, the government introduced a new system of electronic voting machines. While many Georgians assumed that the government would make such a change only if it served its own interests, some NGOs, political parties, and international organizations believed that the new system provided stronger safeguards for free and fair elections. The skeptics were right. Although the Georgian opposition is still investigating the specifics of the government&#x2019;s electoral fraud, it is clear that Georgia has not witnessed such massive election interference since its first post-Soviet election 33 years ago. In Tbilisi and other large cities, Georgian Dream clearly lost. But in many rural areas the scale of manipulation seems staggering, and independent election-observer groups have called for annulment of the results in over 246 precincts&#x2014;covering more than 400,000 voters&#x2014;citing grave violations. Given that the new system did not manage to secure ballot secrecy, some NGOs are calling for total annulment of the results and new elections. Encouragingly, the United States and the European Union have called for an investigation into the election, and no Western leader&#x2014;aside from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&#xE1;n&#x2014;has recognized the results as legitimate.

(Giorgi Arjevanidze / AFP via Getty Images)To address this unprecedented election fraud, the U.S. and the EU must support an international investigative mission and clearly state that the election&#x2019;s outcome will not be recognized as legitimate until the investigation is complete. And they should emphasize that refusal to cooperate with the investigation will trigger immediate sanctions against Ivanishvili and his allies. One promising approach would be to launch an investigative mission under the EU&#x2019;s common security and defense policy. An independent investigative mission would provide essential resources and credibility, especially since Georgia&#x2019;s opposition parties and civil-society groups lack the capacity to investigate a crime of this scale on their own. The EU has an obvious stake in finding out what happened in Georgia. In today&#x2019;s era of hybrid warfare, electoral manipulation has become one of Russia&#x2019;s go-to tactics in its ongoing assault on Western democracies. These countries&#x2019; leaders should treat Georgia as an opportunity to confront an urgent security challenge to which they, too, are exposed. Meanwhile, Georgian President Salome Zourabishvili has announced that she will not exercise her constitutional authority to convene the first parliamentary session after an election, accusing Georgian Dream of &#x201C;working hand-in-hand with Russia.&#x201D; Similarly, newly elected opposition lawmakers have stated that they will boycott all parliamentary proceedings if the election results reported by the Ivanishvili-controlled CEC are not validated by international observers. Amid this growing backlash, Ivanishvili may have to convene the new parliament&#x2019;s first session with just Georgian Dream MPs in attendance. Should that happen, Georgia would effectively become a one-party state with an illegitimate government. Whether Ivanishvili is prepared to take this step remains to be seen. Nevertheless, he appears intent on following in Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s footsteps, transforming Georgia from a democracy into an authoritarian state where elections are little more than formalities. For over a decade, he has systematically undermined democratic institutions while persuading Georgians that he is a pro-Western leader, despite having made his fortune in Russia. Ivanishvili probably thought he could maintain this pro-Western fa&#xE7;ade indefinitely, but Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine, and the EU&#x2019;s 2023 decision to grant Georgia candidate status, forced him to reveal his pro-Putin sympathies. Once unmasked, he recognized that his chances of winning a fair election were slim. Georgia now finds itself on the brink of a profound political transformation. If the West fails to support the country&#x2019;s opposition in challenging the election results, its 30-year-old democracy could come to an end. This outcome would derail Georgia&#x2019;s EU accession and mark a strategic defeat for Western countries. Over the past 30 years, Georgia has been the West&#x2019;s most reliable ally in the region, benefiting from substantial U.S. and EU aid aimed at helping the country modernize and build its democracy. Allowing Georgian Dream&#x2019;s electoral fraud to go unchallenged would squander decades of hard-won progress and deal a major blow to the global effort to protect democracy against authoritarian threats.

US lawmakers call for Biden to allow Poland to down Russian missiles over Ukraine	Two U.S. lawmakers have made a bipartisan appeal to President Joe Biden to allow Poland to shoot down Russian missiles over the skies of Ukraine, The Hill reported on Oct. 30. Republican Joe Wilson and Steve Cohen, the chair and ranking member respectively of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, made the call in a letter seen by the news outlet. &quot;Despite Russia&#x2019;s continued escalation through hybrid warfare &#x2014; airspace violations, attacks on critical infrastructure, and efforts to destabilize democratic institutions &#x2014; we have hesitated to confront these threats decisively, allowing Russia to wage a war against the alliance with minimal consequences,&quot; they said. &quot;In this context, Poland&#x2019;s request to intercept and neutralize missiles over Ukraine is both necessary and urgent as a support mechanism for Ukraine and a safeguard to the frontline of NATO&#x2019;s borders.&quot; The possibility of Warsaw downing Russian missiles heading toward Poland through Ukraine was laid out in June in a signed Polish-Ukrainian security agreement. While Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at the time that the matter was still under discussion, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz explained that a decision by all of NATO&apos;s member states would be necessary to take this step. Then-NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg opposed the move, insisting the alliance &quot;will not be involved in this conflict.&quot; Stoltenberg&apos;s successor, Mark Rutte, has yet to address the topic publicly. Sikorski revisited the issue in September when he said he was in favor of shooting down Russian missiles in Poland, warning of a potential nuclear disaster He said Poland has the legal right to down stray Russian missiles and drones that enter Polish airspace. &quot;Russia can no longer...dictate to us how we defend our own country. We have both a constitution and recognized in international law to defend our airspace,&quot; Sikorski said. He warned that a Russian missile could hit a Ukrainian nuclear power plant, referencing the Chornobyl disaster of 1986 that leaked radiation across Ukraine and Belarus. A similar nuclear disaster could also impact Poland. &quot;I think we should help Ukraine to protect its nuclear power plants against such stray Russian missiles,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-lawmakers-call-for-biden-to-allow-poland-to-down-russian-missiles-over-ukraine/	2024-10-31T03:30:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-524224272.jpg
Global entrepreneur organization Endeavor launches first Ukraine office to boost growth amid war	The New York-based global entrepreneur network Endeavor has opened its first office in Ukraine, signaling confidence in the country&#x2019;s business potential, the organization announced on Oct. 31.Endeavor is a pool of entrepreneurs, mentors, and investors that connects its members to help develop projects and growth. The organization has over 45 offices globally which have supported 2,800 entrepreneurs, created over 4.1 million jobs, and generated annual revenues of over $67 billion, according to the network. The group said it plans to focus on high-growth tech companies that are in the scale-up phase and looking to expand globally. While key industries like metallurgy and agriculture have lost assets and land to Russian attacks and occupation since the start of the full-scale invasion, the tech sector has shown growth and remains the largest industry in terms of exports. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine&#x2019;s digital transformation minister, described the project as a &#x201C;win-win,&#x201D; saying Endeavor will receive &#x201C;smart and dedicated Ukrainians,&#x201D; in exchange for its presence in Ukraine. No matter the sector, entrepreneurs in wartime Ukraine face relentless Russian drone and missile attacks, economic instability, and acute labor shortages brought on by migration abroad and mobilization efforts that keep workers away from official employment.Sviatoslav Sviatnenko, Endeavor&#x2019;s managing director in Ukraine, said that the non-profit will help Ukrainian entrepreneurs overcome challenges including recruiting high-end talent, setting up abroad, assisting the transition from a private to a public company, and preparing for mergers and acquisitions. &#x201C;We will connect them with the right people to help them find answers to their questions and grow their businesses faster,&#x201D; said Sviatnenko. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s no longer about six or so handshakes &#x2014; it&#x2019;s just one.&#x201D;Endeavor&#x2019;s presence in Ukraine will boost support for local entrepreneurs, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Ukraine-Moldova American Enterprise Fund (UMAEF), who are both supporting the project.A board of directors consisting of well-versed Ukrainian entrepreneurs and investors like pharmaceutical company Farmak CEO Volodymyr Kostiuk and tech company Reface Co-founder Dima Shvets will back the project and bolster the entrepreneurial community, said the board&#x2019;s chair Vital Laptenok, co-founder of Ukrainian tech company Genesis and general partner at Flyer One Ventures. &#x201C;A strong economy, great leaders, and success stories &#x2014; this is exactly what we need while the country is at war with Russia,&#x201D; Laptenok said.	https://kyivindependent.com/global-entrepreneur-organization-endeavor-launches-first-ukraine-office-to-boost-growth-amid-war/	2024-10-31T03:30:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/unnamed--5-.jpg
Ukraine charges Russian soldier identified by Kyiv Independent as raping woman	Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office on Oct. 31 charged Russian soldier Mykola Senenko with raping a woman in Kherson Oblast in 2022. The Kyiv Independent in June identified two Russian soldiers who were involved in the rape of two women during the occupation of Kyiv and Kherson oblasts in March 2022, one of whom was Senenko. The findings served as the basis for the Kyiv Independent&apos;s documentary about Russian sexual violence in occupied parts of Ukraine &#x2014; He Came Back &#x2014; available in English and Ukrainian. Synenko, who was drafted from the occupied parts of Donetsk Oblast, was deployed with the Russian 109th Motorized Rifle Regiment in the occupied parts of Kherson Oblast in early 2022. After interviewing the local population and officials on the spot, the Kyiv Independent found that Senenko raped a woman in Krasnivka, Kherson Oblast. The findings were passed to the prosecutor&#x2019;s office. In April, Ukraine&apos;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya told the U.N. Security Council that Russia uses sexual violence as a weapon against civilians and prisoners of war. At the time, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office has recorded nearly 300 cases of sexual violence committed by Russian forces since the beginning of the full-scale war. Citing testimony from people released from Russian captivity, Kyslytsya said that over 50 percent of detainees suffered torture, rape, or other forms of sexual violence. He also mentioned the Prosecutor General&apos;s documented crimes, whose victimes include 188 women, 102 men, and 15 minors. The recorded figures are likely an undercount, Kyslytsya said. &quot;Survivors cannot wait until the war is over,&quot; he said. &#xA0;&quot;They need support and justice now.&quot;Ukraine has launched a pilot program to provide emergency financial reparations to victims of sexual violence, Kyslytsya said. The program is supported by the Global Survivors Fund, which advocates for victims of conflict-related sexual assault.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-charges-russian-soldier-identified-by-kyiv-independent-as-raping-woman/	2024-10-31T03:11:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1244779094.jpeg
Russian court fines Google $2.5 trillion trillion trillion	A Russian court has fined Google $2.5 decillion after the U.S. tech giant allegedly blocked pro-Kremlin propaganda on YouTube, Russian state media reported on Oct. 29. An original fine of 100,000 rubles was handed to Google in 2020 which, under Russian law, has since doubled every week. Written in full $2.5 decillion is $2,500,000,000,000,000,&#x200B;000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or $2.5 trillion trillion trillion. Global GDP is only $110 trillion, or $110,000,000,000,000. Russian state media channel TASS reported that if the fine is not paid within nine months, it will begin to double every day. &quot;We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect,&quot; Google said in its quarterly results published on Oct. 29, as reported by the Independent. Google&apos;s legal problems with Russia preceded the full-scale war. The company was fined 7.2 billion rubles ($78.2 million) in December 2021 for failing to take down content that Russia has banned. Google was again fined 21.1 billion rubles ($227 million) in August 2022 and 3 million rubles ($32,000) in May 2023 for similar content related offenses. Previous appeals by Google were rejected by Russian courts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-court-fines-google-2-5-trillion-trillion-trillion/	2024-10-31T02:13:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-57366651.jpg
Time names Ukraine's online wedding service among best inventions of 2024	The Time magazine chose the Ukrainian Diia app&#x2019;s online marriage service to be one of the best inventions of 2024, its website reported on Oct. 30. For more than two decades, Time editors have annually spotlighted the most influential new products and ideas in their Best Inventions issue. Dubbed &quot;the country in the smartphone,&quot; the Diia mobile app was launched by the Digital Transformation Ministry in 2020. As of early August, it included some 130 services and is used by more than 20 million Ukrainians, according to officials. Ukrainians can apply, propose, and get married online by choosing a place and date. The couple can be in the same place or hundreds of kilometers apart. Ukraine became the first country to have such a practice fully digitalized. Since the start of the full-scale war, nearly a million people have been defending the country. Through the app, soldiers can now get married while on the front line. According to the Digital Transformation Ministry, as of Sept. 20, 251 couples had gotten married in Diia, and 3,200 had applied for marriage online. Almost 830,000 proposals were recorded, with 106,000 people saying &quot;yes.&quot; Apart from marrying online, the app allows users to access various official documents, including their passports, driver&apos;s licenses, or vehicle registrations. It also allows users to register a business or pay taxes with a few clicks.	https://kyivindependent.com/time-names-ukraines-online-wedding-service-among-best-inventions-of-2024/	2024-10-31T00:59:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2152964421.jpg
Ukraine's UN envoy names North Korean generals sent to aid Russia's war	The Ukrainian ambassador to the U.N., Sergiy Kyslytsya, provided the names of the three generals North Korea had sent to join Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Oct. 30. Ukraine previously revealed that Russia is preparing to deploy a 12,000-strong contingent of North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals. The top officers include two deputy chiefs of the North Korean General Staff: Colonel General Kim Yong Bok, who oversees special forces, and Colonel General Ri Chang Ho, who is in charge of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea&apos;s intelligence agency, Kyslytsya said. The third general is Major General Sin Kum Cheol, the head of the Main Operational Directorate, according to the Ukrainian envoy. Kim, who is believed to serve as the representative of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Russia, commands the XI Corps special forces, which Seoul believes had been sent to aid Moscow&apos;s war. Ri, the chief of the spy agency, has been sanctioned by South Korea over his involvement in a number of cyber attacks, Reuters reported. Moscow plans to form at least five 2,000-3,000-strong units manned by North Korean troops, Kyslytsya said. They would equipped with Russian uniforms and arms and integrated into formations with ethnic minorities from Russia&apos;s Far East regions to conceal their presence. NATO and the Pentagon said that some North Korean forces have already arrived in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive in August. Kyslytsya estimated the number of North Korean troops already stationed in Kursk Oblast to be 400. &quot;According to available information, between October 23 and 28, at least seven aircraft carrying military personnel of up to 2,100 soldiers flew from the Eastern Military District to Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine,&quot; Kyslytsya said at a meeting called to discuss the dispatch of Pyongyang&apos;s forces. Kyiv expects North Korean troops to join the fight against Ukraine in November. Speaking at the meeting, Russian envoy Vasily Nebenzya denied the transfer and called it a &quot;bare-faced lie&quot; despite mounting evidence of the contrary. Russia and North Korea initially refuted the reports but later took a more evasive stance, saying such a step would be within their right but stopping short of openly confirming it. Moscow and Pyongyang have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both countries denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-names-north-korean-generals/	2024-10-31T00:38:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147865497.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 694,950 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 694,950 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 31. This number includes 1,310 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,156 tanks, 18,450 armored fighting vehicles, 27,961 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,013 artillery systems, 1,243 multiple launch rocket systems, 994 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 18,063 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-694-950-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-30T23:31:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2163893306.jpg
Georgia's president declines to appear before prosecutors in election fraud investigation	Georgia&#x2019;s Prosecutor&apos;s Office announced on Oct. 30 it had launched an investigation into alleged vote rigging in the recent parliamentary elections. President Salome Zourabichvili, who was summoned for questioning as part of the probe, has refused to appear at the Prosecutor&apos;s Office. The Prosecution Service of Georgia announced on Oct. 30 it would carry out all necessary investigative and procedural steps to examine the issues highlighted by the Central Election Commission, the president, various political parties, and election observation groups. In response to the allegations, the Election Commission said it would recount votes at several randomly selected polling stations. During a press conference in Tbilisi, President Zourabichvili presented footage purportedly showing ballot violations. &quot;It is not the President&apos;s responsibility to provide evidence that already exists within society,&quot; she said, adding that that non-governmental organizations, observers, and citizens have consistently provided substantial evidence, revealing extensive and systematic election rigging. The investigation followed the opposition&#x2019;s denunciation of the parliamentary elections as illegitimate. The ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory with 54% of the votes, despite protests from the pro-Western opposition, which described the election as a &quot;constitutional coup.&quot; President Zourabichvili also noted that her summons to the prosecutor&#x2019;s office suspiciously coincided with recent remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, former President of Russia and current Deputy Chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council. Medvedev had previously called for Zourabichvili&#x2019;s &quot;removal from office and arrest.&quot; The European Union expressed concerns about &quot;irregularities&quot; observed during the voting process and suspended Georgia&apos;s EU accession process as of Oct. 30. U.S. President Joe Biden said he was &quot;deeply alarmed&quot; by democratic backsliding in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgias-president-declines-to-appear-before-prosecutors-in-election-fraud-investigation/	2024-10-30T22:47:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180878552.jpg
Ukraine produces 20 Bohdana howitzers per month, Zelensky says	President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine is now producing nearly 20 Bohdana self-propelled artillery units monthly. In a video address on Oct. 30 following his visit to the Ukraine-Nordic Summit, Zelensky highlighted the success of the &quot;Danish model,&quot; a partnership that enables Ukraine to secure funding from allies specifically for its defense production. &quot;...The Danish model allows (us) to attract finance from our partners in Ukrainian defense production. For example, we&#x2019;re now manufacturing almost 20 &apos;Bohdana&apos; artillery units monthly, with strong progress across other areas,&quot; Zelensky explained. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. &quot;And there&#x2019;s more to come: shells, equipment, drones &#x2013; everything we need. My gratitude goes out to everyone assisting us,&quot; the president added. The 2S22 Bohdana is a truck-mounted self-propelled howitzer with a 42-kilometer firing range. Its &quot;shoot and scoot&quot; capability provides a significant advantage over towed artillery. Unlike towed guns, which are vulnerable to enemy detection after firing and require time-consuming relocation, the Bohdana can quickly move after firing, enhancing its survivability on the battlefield.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-produces-20-bohdana-howitzers-per-month-zelensky-says/	2024-10-30T21:48:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-18-at-16_48_24.png
Ukraine could join Union by late 2029, EU official says	Ukraine could join the European Union by 2029 if it completes the necessary reforms, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi said on Oct. 29. To advance this goal, the EU has introduced specific initiatives, such as the &quot;Growth Plan&quot; and the &quot;Ukraine Plan,&quot; aimed at accelerating reform processes in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans. Ukraine submitted its plan on March 20, detailing its vision for reconstruction, modernization, and reforms essential to its EU accession journey. Ukraine has made significant strides toward EU membership since applying in February 2022, and receiving candidate status by June of that year. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, marking a pivotal advancement in its integration efforts. The European Commission has recently praised Ukraine&#x2019;s progress on critical reforms, including those related to the rule of law, judicial system, and anti-corruption measures, though it emphasizes that further reforms are still required. &#x201C;With the Growth Plan, we have made it possible for the Western Balkans, for Moldova, but also for Ukraine [with the Ukraine Facility], to complete the reforms and to have everything ready and to become a member by the end of the next mandate (of the European Commission),&#x201D; Varhelyi noted. In June, President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed confidence that Ukraine would achieve full membership in the European Union. The first intergovernmental conference on Ukraine&apos;s EU accession took place in Luxembourg on June 25, officially launching accession negotiations between Ukraine and the European Union.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-could-join-union-by-late-2029-eu-official-says/	2024-10-30T19:18:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2156213730.jpg
Sanctioned LNG ships gather off Russian coast as buyers withdraw, Bloomberg reports	Tankers bearing sanctioned Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) have clustered together off Russia&apos;s eastern coast, indicating that Moscow is struggling to sell the product amid Western restrictions, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 30. Days before, commerical liquefication at Russia&apos;s Arctic LNG 2 came to a halt due to shipping difficulties imposed by Western sanctions. Three of the tankers now anchored near Russia previously loaded cargo from the Arctic LNG 2 facility. The vessels &#x2014;&#xA0;Nova Energy, Pioneer, and Asya Energy &#x2014;&#xA0;are docked near the port of Nakhodka, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. All three tankers have been sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. Arctic LNG 2, owned by Russia&apos;s Novatek company, was envisaged as Russia&apos;s largest LNG plant and a flagship project that would help the country become the world&apos;s leading LNG producer. It aimed to produce almost 20 million metric tons of LNG per year. Russia intended to sell Arctic LNG 2 products primarily to Asian markets, but companies from China and Japan suspended participation in the project last December due to international sanctions. The government of India also announced in September 2024 that it would not buy LNG produced at the Arctic LNG 2 facility. While the plant began shipping cargoes in August, Russia has reportedly not been able to find a buyer for its products. The U.S. on Oct. 30 announced new sanctions on a company that transported equipment for the Arctic LNG 2 project and a network of shipping companies from the UAE and Singapore involved in the purchase of LNG transportation vessels for Novatek. The latest round of restrictions came after the U.S. on Oct. 22 said it would &quot;tighten the screws&quot; on the export of Russian LNG, depriving Moscow of energy revenues that fund the full-scale war in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctioned-lng-ships-gather-off-russian-coast-as-buyers-withdraw-bloomberg-reports/	2024-10-30T17:43:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2159134814.jpg
Parts of Pokrovsk will be blocked for city's defense, authorities say	Parts of the city of Pokrovsk will be blocked off due to defense preparations, Serhii Dobriak, head of the Pokrovsk military administration, told Suspilne on Oct. 30. The embattled front-line city of Pokrovsk has been a focal point of Russia&apos;s offensive in the Donetsk sector in recent months. The city is a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. &quot;Fortifications are being built in Pokrovsk, and we are already entering the city, and certain areas of the city will be blocked, so please leave these areas, not entering or leaving the city,&quot; Dobriak said. &quot;Several echelons have already been built in the city, which will partially block the streets and neighborhoods of Pokrovsk.&quot; Entry and exit to the city will not be entirely blocked, Dobriak said, clarifying earlier remarks on national television. Dobriak&apos;s announcement follows reports that Russia has captured the nearby town of Selydove. While Ukraine has not officially confirmed the claims, an expert told the Kyiv Independent that Selydove is effectively &quot;lost.&quot; The loss of Selydove is dire news for Pokrovsk, which lies only around 18 kilometers (11 miles) northwest. Russian forces have been inching toward Pokrovsk for the past couple of months, gaining territory despite mounting losses. Much of the city infrastructure has already been destroyed, Dobriak said. &quot;The infrastructure is 80% destroyed. Power supply is available in 60% of Pokrovsk, it is absent in six settlements and the town of Rodynske,&quot; he said. &quot;The wounded are taken to Dobropillia, we have family doctors and a city hospital. There are 325 wells in the city, including 9 points of free drinking water. The utility company also delivers water, and UNICEF has been helping to deliver water for two weeks.&quot; According to Dobriak, 11,900 people, including 55 children, remain in Pokrovsk as of Oct. 30. Evacuations are ongoing. Before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Pokrovsk had a population of around 60,000.	https://kyivindependent.com/parts-of-pokrovsk-will-be-blocked-for-citys-defense-authorities-say/	2024-10-30T16:39:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179808433.jpg
Russian attack on Kharkiv kills child, injures at least 29	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked a residential neighborhood in the city of Kharkiv late in the evening on Oct. 30, killing a child and injuring at least 29 people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. According to preliminary data, the attack was carried out with a high-explosive FAB-500 bomb, Syniehubov said. A child was killed, and 29 people were injured. The attack hit a 9-story building, destroying the entryway from the first through fifth floors, the State Emergency Service reported. Fires are being extinguished in several apartments and rescuers are searching for more victims who may be trapped beneath the rubble. Several injured people, including a child, have already been pulled from the debris, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless Russian attacks for over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. In recent months, Moscow has intensified aerial strikes, often targeting densely populated neighborhoods. A Russian bombing on Oct. 28 damaged the Derzhprom building (the State Industry Building), a historic landmark which has been under enhanced UNESCO protection since 2022. An overnight attack just hours later killed four people and destroyed several homes.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-kharkiv-injures-23-including-child/	2024-10-30T15:47:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/kharkiv1.jpg
Putin will not prevail in Ukraine,' even with North Korean help, US defense secretary says	North Korean troops outfitted with Russian uniforms and equipment are making their way to the Russia-Ukraine border, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Oct. 30 during a joint press conference with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun. North Korea has sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine, though estimates vary as to the number of troops. The Financial Times reported on Oct. 29 that 3,000 North Korean soldiers in Kursk Oblast were housed only 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. &quot;The evidence now suggests the that North Korea has sent about 10,000 soldiers to train in eastern Russia,&quot; Austin said at the Pentagon briefing. &quot;And some of these DPRK troops have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are seeing them outfitted with Russian uniforms and provided with Russian equipment.&quot; Austin said he would not speculate as to when the North Korean units would begin to engage in direct combat alongside Russian soldiers, but said that the U.S. was working with international partners to &quot;discourage Russia from employing these troops in combat.&quot; The deployment of North Korean troops is a direct result of Russia&apos;s heavy battle losses, Austin added. An allliance with North Korea highlights &quot;how much trouble&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin is in. &quot;Putin will not prevail in Ukraine, even with more help from North Korea.&quot; South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun condemned North Korea&apos;s involvement in Russia&apos;s war, calling such action a &quot;war crime&quot; and demanding the &quot;immediate withdrawal&quot; of North Korean troops. &#xA0; &quot;The deployment is (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un&apos;s attempt to maintain its dictatorship, and Kim Jong Un didn&apos;t hesitate to sell out its young people and troops as cannon fodder mercenaries,&quot; he said. Kim also discussed the role a South Korean monitoring delegation would play, following President Yoon Suk Yeol&apos;s announcement on Oct. 28 that Seoul would send observers to Ukraine in the coming days. &quot;I believe it could serve as a great opportunity for our analysis team or observers to learn the movements or trends of the North Korean troops,&quot; Kim said. Information gathered on North Korea&apos;s weapons systems and tactics would be useful to the future security of South Korea, Kim said. &quot;If we don&apos;t send our observers or analysis teams, it would mean we are not faithfully doing our jobs,&quot; he said. Moscow and Pyongyang&apos;s &quot;unlawful military cooperation&quot; represents an escalation in the war, Austin said, and there will be &quot;consequences&quot; to their escalating aggression. The U.S. is considering &quot;different kinds of action,&quot; but Austin declined to provide details or examples.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-will-not-prevail-in-ukraine-even-with-north-korean-help-us-defense-secretary-says/	2024-10-30T15:12:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181250913.jpg
Can Harris sway Pennsylvania’s Ukrainian vote ahead of a tight presidential race?	JENKINTOWN, Pennsylvania &#x2014; Ukrainian American Sophika Lashchyk-Tytla says she can&#x2019;t understand why her brother plans to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump given his open hostility to continuing U.S. support for Ukraine. Hours after unconvincing arguments with her brother, the Philadelphia native carried a kit of campaign information as she canvassed in the city&#x2019;s suburbs with fellow Ukrainians who&#x2019;ve rallied around Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Just ten days before the election, nearly a dozen went door-knocking in Montgomery County, where one of the country&#x2019;s largest Ukrainian populations now has voter material available in Ukrainian for the first time. The county includes non-voting recent emigres from President Joe Biden&#x2019;s post-full-scale invasion Uniting for Ukraine parole program and thousands more with U.S. citizenship who arrived in the 1990s. The door-to-door canvassing in the campaign&apos;s final days unfolded amid immense stakes for Ukraine&#x2019;s more than two-and-a-half-year fight against Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Pennsylvania is the swing state all paths to the White House seem to run through for both candidates. &#x201C;I feel like I&#x2019;m trying to save Ukraine and our country and I can&#x2019;t listen to your (Trump) stuff,&#x201D; Lashchyk-Tytla told her brother as she departed for a weekend of rallying Ukrainian support for Harris. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s thinking (about) Ukraine, the Ukrainians that are voting for (Trump) have been listening to his double-speak, and more recently, he&#x2019;s been really clear that he&#x2019;s not supportive of Ukraine, so how can you say that &#x2018;Trump is going to help Ukraine&#x2019; and say he is the only one who keeps (Russia) on their toes?&#x201D; Sophika Lashchyk-Tytla, a Ukrainian American from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, joined the Harris campaign as a volunteer to door-knock in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , USA on Oct. 26, 2024. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)In the final days of the campaign, Vice President Harris&#x2019;s team knows securing Montgomery County could lead to capturing the entire state demands support from Pennsylvania&#x2019;s large Eastern European population. Their numbers exceed the crucial margin of victory, with Biden winning by nearly 81,000 votes in the state in 2020 to prevent Trump&#x2019;s re-election to a second term. The Harris campaign hopes that by going to traditionally conservative Ukrainian communities in Pennsylvania and reminding them of Trump&#x2019;s adversarial position to supporting Ukraine in its defense of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, the state&#x2019;s Polish and Lithuanian populations will also show up for Harris alongside their Ukrainian neighbors. Andrew Lashchyk, Spohika&#x2019;s 57-year-old brother, says he&#x2019;s sent thousands of dollars to support Ukraine. He simultaneously wants a better U.S. economy and for Ukraine to not cede any of its land to Russia, which is why he&#x2019;ll vote for Trump. The war will end sooner under a Trump administration, he says. &#x201C;In terms of what Trump will do for Ukraine, it&#x2019;s kind of up in the air, I don&apos;t believe he will necessarily provide weapons and help so to speak, but what he will do is pressure (Russian President Vladimir Putin),&#x201D; Lashchyk told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;I believe that Trump will negotiate some kind of end to the war, do I believe Ukraine will have to cede some of our ground in order for the killing to stop, probably, I&#x2019;m totally not okay with that but I have no choice.&#x201D; For Lashchyk, who considers himself extremely patriotic for Ukraine and America, Harris hasn&#x2019;t offered enough commitment to Ukraine in her campaign. &#x201C;If (Harris) somehow was able to guarantee me another $30 billion that would be sent (to Ukraine) the day she won office, okay I might give up my American country for Ukraine.&#x201D; Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine is one of the candidates&#x2019; most vividly contentious issues of the Nov. 5 election, with their respective positions in near complete opposition to each other. &#x201C;Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda will not only raise costs for Ukrainian-American families and strip them of their fundamental freedoms, it will also put the people of Ukraine in grave danger as he sidles up to Putin, threatens to cut off support for Ukraine, and abandons our allies,&#x201D; Filip Jotevski, the Harris campaign&#x2019;s national director of diaspora and ethnic engagement, wrote in a statement to the Kyiv Independent. After appearing alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in September, Harris offered a glimpse into her stance on her support for Ukraine, saying in an October interview that Ukraine&#x2019;s hope to join NATO is a question for the future but that she would not meet with Putin for peace talks without Ukraine&#x2019;s presence. In a highly anticipated Oct. 29 speech on the National Mall in the shadow of the White House, she added that Putin and North Korea are cheering for Trump to win. Trump, who has a history of cozying up to Putin, has pledged &#x2014; with minimal detail &#x2014; to swiftly end the war and even blamed Zelensky for stoking Moscow&#x2019;s invasion of his country. The vast divide between the two candidates&apos; positions on Ukraine is visible in the campaign&apos;s final days. While both candidates are focused on Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Latino and Black voters, Trump&#x2019;s attention to the full-scale war and large voting diaspora are at a minimum. For Harris, her surrogates are ramping up outreach to Americans of Ukrainian roots in crucial swing states. After hiring Jotevski to lead national diaspora efforts in September and placing him in Pennsylvania for the race&#x2019;s final stretch, Harris&#x2019;s campaign is rallying Americans with Ukrainian roots to door-knock in Philadelphia&#x2019;s suburbs. Nearly half of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Ukrainian diaspora of between 100,000 and 200,000 reside in that area. &#x201C;While Donald Trump cozies up to dictators like Putin and idolizes fascists like Hitler, Vice President Kamala Harris will never waver in her defense of America&#x2019;s security and ideals or the people of Ukraine,&#x201D; Jotevski said. But Harris-canvassing Ukrainians are disappointed by the diaspora&apos;s small but passionate turnout for the Democratic nominee, citing concerns that many in their community are quietly voting for Trump over domestic issues like the economy. &#x201C;Maybe 30-40% (of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Ukrainian community) is for Harris, and the (rest), the majority is still for Trump,&#x201D; said Marta Fedoriw, a prominent figure in the region&#x2019;s Ukrainian diaspora community. Marta Fedoriw, a Ukrainian living in rural Pennsylvania, at the rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, on Oct. 26, 2024. Fedoriw says she&#x2019;s voting for Harris because she liked the vice president&#x2019;s words when said she&#x2019;ll stand with Kyiv until Ukraine prevails. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)&#x201C;We know that Ukrainian Americans were very Republican years ago, because of the Republican Party, (President Dwight D.) Eisenhower, (Ronald) Reagan, strong anti-Soviet Union (feelings), but since these last few elections they&#x2019;ve turned the Ukrainian vote (silent), they&#x2019;re still voting for Trump but they don&#x2019;t want to talk about it.&#x201D; Fedoriw, who is the chair of the Return Ukraine&#x2019;s Children initiative at the Ukrainian National Women&#x2019;s League of America, &#x200B;&#x200B;has been rallying across Pennsylvania for the Ukrainian community to vote for Harris, including at an Oct. 26 event co-sponsored by the Harris campaign. She says it&#x2019;s not that clear why so many in the state&#x2019;s diaspora plan to vote for Trump. She hears Ukrainians say things like, &#x2018;Trump is a businessman, we need a tough guy to deal with Putin,&#x2019; and &#x2018;What has Biden done for Ukraine, he&#x2019;s been slowly doling out support.&#x2019; &#xA0; Both Trump and Harris-supporting Ukrainians in Pennsylvania who spoke with the Kyiv Independent are frustrated by the Biden Administration&#x2019;s slow drip of aid to Ukraine that has at times been delayed and repeated contradictions of previously stated red lines, such as the delivery of Western fighter jets. &#xA0; Because of what she hears, Fedoriw knows the Harris campaign&#x2019;s targeting of Eastern Europeans is needed, especially to reach the state&#x2019;s 700,000 Polish Americans. Despite widely shared fears in the state&#x2019;s Polish community that Putin&#x2019;s sights are set beyond Ukraine, Fedoriw says the population&#x2019;s ties to the Roman Catholic Church are so deep that Harris&#x2019;s stance on abortion rights is pushing many toward Trump. Others disagree, such as Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Polish American community leaders, who endorsed Harris after she gave the community recognition in the campaign&#x2019;s only Harris-Trump debate. &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you (Trump) tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up (Ukraine,&#x201D; Harris said in the debate. After the Harris campaign sponsored an event to get Ukrainians in Pennsylvania out to vote, a handful of the diaspora went door-knocking in a predominantly working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA on Oct. 26, 2024. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)But no diaspora community is a monolith. The Harris campaign hosted a Polish American bus tour across Pennsylvania two weeks out from the election and took nearly a dozen Ukrainians canvassing on Oct. 26 after a rally to reach Ukrainian voters. Speakers at the event included Victoria Nuland, the former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, and Alexander Vindman, the Ukraine-born former director for European Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council. Two days later, the former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger and other Harris surrogates told Scranton, Pennsylvania voters that a vote for Harris and running mate Tim Walz is a vote for the continued support of NATO and Ukraine. However, some of the few dozen passionate Ukrainians at the rally reserved feelings of fear that the Harris campaign&#x2019;s efforts aren&#x2019;t reaching swayable Ukrainians and may even be too little too late. Fedoriw said the huge voting block has pockets of Ukrainian voters who still associate Democrats with communism and, despite their hopes for Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty, can&#x2019;t come around on voting for Harris. &#x201C;That really hit me, how few people were at the rally,&#x201D; Lashchyk-Tytla, the Ukrainian from Philadelphia&#x2019;s suburbs, said. &#x201C;The turnout was horrible (given) the amount of Ukrainians we have here.&#x201D; The chair of the Montgomery County&#x2019;s Board of Elections, Neil Makhija, sat for a town hall in the center of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Ukrainian community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA on Oct. 26, 2024. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The Trump campaign is equally spending the final stretch in Pennsylvania but is more focused on reaching Black voters and relaying messages about &#x201C;election integrity&#x201D; than allocating resources to door-knocking. If the Trump campaign is doing outreach to Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Eastern Europeans, the message isn&#x2019;t reaching Ukrainians around Philadelphia, according to multiple leaders in the Ukrainian community who spoke with the Kyiv Independent in the campaign&#x2019;s final days. The Trump campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment on their approach to reaching diaspora communities. Just north of Philadelphia in Jenkintown, the heart of the Ukrainian community, attendees of the last Sunday service of October at the St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church spilled into a dining hall for a nonpartisan town hall on the significance of the election for Ukraine. The county&#x2019;s Board of Elections Commissioner, Neil Makhija, who broadened the language accessibility of voter material, took questions from the nearly two dozen attendees. &#x201C;This is an existential issue for Ukrainian American communities, they understand the contrast has never been more clear between the presidential candidates,&#x201D; Makhija told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s one who would essentially let Ukraine disappear and another who is backing the existence of the country.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/can-harris-sway-pennsylvanias-ukrainian-vote-ahead-of-tight-race/	2024-10-30T14:18:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/IMG_0314.JPG
Ukraine war latest: North Korean soldiers reportedly 50 km from Ukraine's border	Key developments on Oct. 30: Around 3,000 North Korean troops who arrived in Kursk Oblast were housed in barracks only 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29, citing undisclosed Ukrainian intelligence officials. A few hundred of those are special forces, with the rest being regular troops, one source said. North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine and deployed them in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28. Recent reports suggest that a small number may already be in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence estimated the number of troops to be around 10,000, while Ukraine put the total number at 12,000. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the troops and cite communication issues with their Russian counterparts as a main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has also been urging China to use its relationship with Pyongyang and apply pressure on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. North Korea&apos;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region has dramatically gained pace in recent days, with analysts saying Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Oct. 29 that Kyiv should strike back at North Korean troops &quot;if they go into Ukraine.&quot; A Pentagon spokesman added at a separate briefing that Moscow&apos;s recourse to North Korean troops reflects a &quot;dire situation&quot; of its manpower. &quot;I am concerned about it, yes,&quot; Biden answered to a question regarding their arrival, adding that Ukraine should strike back if the troops enter into Ukrainian territory, but did not elaborate further. In a separate news briefing on Oct. 28, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said a &quot;relatively small number&quot; of North Korean troops are already in Kursk Oblast, echoing recent comments by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who said thousands more troops are expected to head there in the coming weeks. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. Ukraine&apos;s request for Tomahawk missiles was &quot;confidential information&quot; between partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky complained on Oct. 30 after a leak in the U.S. media. The New York Times reported on Oct. 29 that, according to undisclosed U.S. officials, the request for Tomahawk missiles with a range of 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) was part of the secretive &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; included in Ukraine&apos;s victory plan. The sources told the outlet that Washington was unconvinced that Ukraine needed the weaponry and was reluctant to supply them due to their limited numbers. &quot;It was confidential information between Ukraine and the White House. How to understand these messages?&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing with journalists from Nordic countries. &quot;So this means (that) between partners, there is no (confidentiality).&quot; According to Zelensky, Ukraine requested the missiles on the condition that it would deploy them only if Russia refused to end its war and de-escalate. &quot;I said that this is a preventive method. I was told that it is an escalation,&quot; Zelensky said. Kyiv has been trying to secure additional assistance from U.S. President Joe Biden before he leaves office in January. There are fears that Washington might scale down its support if Republican nominee Donald Trump wins the election on Nov. 5. Facing Russian military advances and increasingly uncertain Western support, Zelensky pitched the five-step victory plan, containing steps that should supposedly end the war by 2025. Some points of the plan were met with a lukewarm response from partners, with the White House still refusing to permit long-range strikes on Russian territory and several countries resisting a NATO invitation for Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Oct. 30 denied alleged talks with Ukraine about mutually halting strikes on energy infrastructure, the Russian state news agency TASS reported. The denial comes after the Financial Times reported that Ukraine and Russia are planning to resume discussions about halting the strikes on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure after the talks abruptly ended in August following Ukraine&apos;s Kursk incursion. &quot;There is a lot of fake news now that has no connection to reality,&quot; Peskov told the media, referring to the Financial Times story. According to a senior Ukrainian official, Moscow and Kyiv have already reduced the frequency of attacks on energy infrastructure in recent weeks as part of an agreement reached by their intelligence services, Ukrainian news outlet New Voice reported on Oct. 30. An agreement would mark the most significant de-escalation of the war since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 21 that a willingness on Russia&apos;s part to halt the strikes might signal a willingness to start broader peace talks. Ukraine is bracing for its toughest winter yet, with half of its energy infrastructure in ruins after Russia launched massive campaigns against the country&apos;s energy grid in the autumn-winter period of 2023-2023 and again in the spring of 2024. Between March and August of this year, Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. South Korea is currently not considering directly providing 155 mm artillery shells to Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Oct. 30, citing a senior South Korean official. Seoul has not received such a request from the Ukrainian side, and the matter is not under consideration, the source told the South Korean news agency amid speculations of South Korea&apos;s shifting stance on the issue. South Korea has not provided direct lethal support to Kyiv as its legislation prohibits supplying arms to a warzone, though unconfirmed reports suggested Ukraine has obtained South Korean shells indirectly via the U.S. The country&apos;s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, said South Korea might revise its stance in the light of deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea, namely in regards to the dispatch of North Korean troops to join the war. A South Korean delegation is expected to visit Ukraine this week to share intelligence on North Korean soldiers and discuss mutual cooperation. Kyiv also plans to send a special envoy to South Korea, and the two countries will discuss the topic this week, Yonhap reported. &quot;It will take a day or two for the Ukrainian side to designate a special envoy and finalize a plan to visit and hold discussions here,&quot; the official told the news agency. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition shells. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. Ukrainian officials said that simply holding the front against Russian forces requires 75,000 shells a month. Moscow&apos;s troops can fire several times more shells than Ukraine, with roughly half reportedly provided by North Korea. Russia is also believed to be preparing the deployment of 12,000 North Korean troops, with at least some of them in combat roles. A small number of North Korean soldiers have already arrived in Ukraine, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing Western intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-north-korean-soldiers-50-km-from-ukraines-border-including-special-forces/	2024-10-30T14:08:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg
UK promises $3.8 billion per year in military aid to Ukraine	The U.K. will allocate three billion pounds ($3.8 billion) per year to military support for Ukraine, according to the draft budget submitted to the parliament on Oct. 30. The proposed budget, which includes some tax increases and slashed expenditures, will increase the national defense budget and maintain the U.K.&apos;s previous commitments to Ukraine&apos;s military support. &quot;Today, I am announcing a total increase to the Ministry of Defense&apos;s Budget of &#xA3;2.9 billion next year, ensuring the U.K. comfortably exceeds our NATO commitments and providing guaranteed military support to Ukraine of &#xA3;3 billion per year, for as long as it takes,&quot; U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves announced on Oct. 30. The funds are in addition to a &#xA3;2.26 billion ($2.9 billion) loan, backed by frozen Russian assets, that the U.K. government announced last week. The U.K.&apos;s Labor party, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, came to power in July following a resounding electoral victory. The draft budget aims to tackle &quot;a decade and a half&quot; of stagnation along with high national debt. Despite these financial challenges, the Labor budget does not propose any cuts to Ukraine&apos;s military aid and builds on the previous government&apos;s promises. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged last May to send Ukraine &#xA3;3 billion per year for &quot;as long as is necessary.&quot; The U.K. has consistently voiced strong support for Ukraine, alongside the U.S. and Germany. The country has pledgedover $9 billion in military assistance since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-promises-3-8-billion-per-year-in-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2024-10-30T14:02:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181900819.jpg
Georgia's accession to EU has been suspended due to actions of Georgian government	The process of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union has been suspended due to the actions of the Georgian government since the spring of 2024, the European Commission announced on Oct. 30. The decision comes after the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party won a majority in the Oct. 26 parliamentary elections. Pro-EU parties have disputed the result, and European monitors also said the elections were characterized by intimidation and irregularities. Although Georgia received EU candidate status last December, the accession process has been &quot;de facto halted due to the course of action taken by the Georgian government since Spring 2024,&quot; &#xA0;the European Commission&apos;s statement read. A joint International Election Observation Mission led by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) identified &quot;several shortcomings that occurred in a tense and highly polarized environment.&quot; Among the shortcomings, the European Commission singled out the recent legislative amendments to the election process, frequent compromises on vote secrecy, procedural inconsistencies, intimidation, and pressure on voters that negatively impacted public trust in the process. The European Commission also insisted on the need for comprehensive electoral reform, which has already been mentioned in the body&apos;s previous key recommendations. Pawel Herczynski, the Ambassador of the European Union to Georgia, also confirmed the suspension of the country&apos;s accession to the European Union. &quot;Due to the course of action taken by the Georgian government, EU leaders stopped Georgia&apos;s accession process. It remains on hold as long as Georgia continues to move away from the EU, our values, and our principles,&quot; Herczynski said. Herczynski said that the Georgian authorities have not demonstrated &quot;sufficient political will&quot; to implement the necessary reforms on the path to EU membership. Referring to the latest EU Enlargement Report, the ambassador mentioned that Georgia has lagged behind in steps related to combating disinformation, political polarization, elections, and human rights. There has also been a setback in the judicial system, which Herczynski called &quot;unprecedented&quot; for an EU candidate country. &quot;What&apos;s next? The future of EU-Georgia relations is now in the hands of the Georgian leaders,&quot; he said. The Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led the country closer to Moscow while curbing its EU aspirations. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year sparked mass demonstrations and led to the EU effectively freezing Georgia&apos;s accession process. After the results of the Oct. 26 vote were announced, Georgian opposition groups refused to recognize the result and said the election was stolen, pointing to election monitors reporting numerous violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said on Oct. 27 that the Georgian parliament will approve the government despite the opposition&apos;s protests.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgias-accession-to-eu-has-been-suspended-due-to-actions-of-georgian-government/	2024-10-30T13:15:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180419095.jpg
EU slams Ukraine's wartime pool of TV channels, urges Kyiv to restore media pluralism	The European Commission has criticized the telethon, Ukraine&apos;s state-run pool of TV channels created during wartime, and urged Kyiv to restore a &quot;pluralistic media landscape,&quot; according to an updated report on progress made by EU candidate countries published on Oct. 30. The so-called telethon, branded as &quot;Yedyni Novyny&quot; (&quot;United News&quot;), was launched at the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. It was created by merging the coverage of Ukraine&apos;s biggest TV channels. The telethon was initially seen as a legitimate response to Russia&apos;s aggression, but later, it was accused of monopolizing television coverage and stifling dissent. Some opposition television channels have complained that they were excluded from the telethon due to their political stance. Brussels expects Ukraine to restore the work of all broadcasters in the pre-war format, questioning the telethon&apos;s objectivity. One of the European Commission&apos;s criticisms concerns the financing of the telethon from the state budget. The European Commission also commented on the Rada TV channel, emphasizing that the media should cover the work of the entire parliament, including the opposition. Despite concerns about the functioning of the media in Ukraine, the European Commission said it is ready to open the first negotiation clusters, starting with fundamentals, with Ukraine in 2025. &quot;The opening of accession negotiations with Ukraine has been an important recognition of Ukraine&apos;s determination to pursue reforms on the path of European Union accession,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Following the first intergovernmental conference in June 2024, the analytical examination of the acquis (the screening) is progressing smoothly.&quot; Ukraine received EU candidate status in June 2022. The European Commission recommended launching accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova in November 2023, and the European Council approved the decision a month later. The commission then presented the negotiation framework. The first intergovernmental conference on Ukraine&apos;s accession was held in Luxembourg in June, marking the official beginning of accession negotiations between the European Union and Ukraine. However, Ukraine&apos;s entry into the EU most likely remains years away. Katarina Mathernova, the EU ambassador to Ukraine, said that Kyiv could join the bloc in 2030.	https://kyivindependent.com/european-commission-criticizes-state-sponsored-telethon-calls-for-restoration-of-pluralistic-media-landscape-in-ukraine/	2024-10-30T13:15:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1775102025.jpeg
Next Ramstein meeting to take place in 'coming weeks,' Zelensky says	The next meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, also known as the Ramstein format, will be held in the &quot;coming weeks,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Oct. 30. Prior to Zelensky&apos;s announcement, the White House said on Oct. 17 that the next meeting in the Ramstein format would be held online in November virtually but did not disclose the exact date of the event. U.S. President Joe Biden was initially supposed to convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany on Oct. 12 but postponed it due to Hurricane Milton in the U.S. &quot;It is very important that each support package is fully implemented, and that our actions with our partners are truly coordinated and as effective as possible,&quot; Zelensky said. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is a U.S.-led group consisting of over 50 countries, including all 32 NATO members, that convenes at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The last Ramstein meeting on Sept. 6 was the group&apos;s 24th gathering since its establishment in April 2022. The upcoming virtual Ramstein meeting will be the first one held at the leader-level. During the last one, Zelensky was present in person, securing more military aid from allies, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada. At the initially planned Ramstein meeting, Zelensky was set to present his five-point victory plan to allies, although he met with leaders individually following the summit&apos;s postponement.	https://kyivindependent.com/next-ramstein-meeting-to-take-place-in-coming-weeks-zelensky-says/	2024-10-30T11:57:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177959215-1.jpg
US imposes sanctions on nearly 400 individuals, legal entities, including Putin's relative	The U.S. imposed sanctions on Oct. 30 against nearly 400 entities and individuals directly or indirectly involved in supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine, the U.S. State Department announced. The U.S. and its allies regularly introduce new restrictions on entities and individuals that fuel Russia&apos;s aggression in Ukraine and help Russia circumvent sanctions. The recent limitations are applied to companies involved in sanctions evasion networks in 17 jurisdictions, including China, India, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Thailand, and Turkey, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The U.S. Treasury Department added about 40 foreign companies to the sanctions list and expanded controls over nearly 50 other organizations to limit the illegal flow of &quot;sensitive dual-use goods&quot; to Russia. The export of precursors to Russia and Belarus was also restricted in order to prevent the production of components that could be used on the battlefield. The sanctions were imposed on a company that transported equipment for the Russian Arctic LNG 2 project and a network of shipping companies from the UAE and Singapore involved in the purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG) transportation vessels for Russia&apos;s Novatek company. Besides, three subsidiaries of Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear energy company, were sanctioned as well. &quot;The U.S. and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,&quot; said Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. The U.S. Treasury Department also sanctioned Russian Deputy Defense Ministers Pavel Fradkov, Andrei Bulyga, Alexander Fomin, and Viktor Goremykin. Fomin was appointed deputy defense minister in early 2017, Goremykin in July 2022, Bulyga in March 2024, and Fradkov in June, already after Andrei Belousov became the new head of Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry. In addition, the U.S. sanctions list includes Anna Tsivileva, the great-niece of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been under European Union sanctions since 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sanctions-on-nearly-400-individuals-legal-entities-including-putins-relative/	2024-10-30T10:52:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2154932665.jpg
Ukraine presents roadmap for partially opening airspace during war	The Communities and Territories Development Ministry presented in Warsaw a roadmap for partially opening Ukraine&apos;s airspace, which has been closed throughout the full-scale invasion, according to a statement by the ministry published on Oct. 30. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine&apos;s airspace has been closed to all flights due to the risk of Russian attacks. The Ukrainian government has nonetheless looked for ways to restore the industry during the war. Deputy Communities and Territories Development Minister Serhii Derkach introduced a step-by-step plan for a partial reopening of the airspace at a conference in Warsaw. Risk assessments for civil aviation, peculiarities of ensuring air navigation safety, Ukraine&apos;s airports&apos; readiness to resume operations, and mechanisms for coordinating civil and military aviation were also discussed. The ministry did not say which airports would open under the plan. The Kyiv Independent earlier reported in March that three airports were rumored to be in consideration if, and when, the country is able to open its airspace during the war: the western Lviv and Uzhhorod airports and Kyiv&#x2019;s Boryspil airport. Besides the ministry, the roadmap was developed with the assistance of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, the State Aviation Service, the State Enterprise for Air Traffic Services (Uksatse), the Air Force Command, and the heads of Ukrainian international airports, including Boryspil and Lviv. &quot;This is the first expert discussion that we expect will help us move forward in creating the conditions for opening the airspace. During the war, our strategic objective is to preserve aviation infrastructure and qualified personnel so that when the time comes, we can resume civilian flights as quickly as possible,&quot; said Oleksii Kuleba, the communities and territories development minister. Mary Elizabeth Madden, economic counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, emphasized the importance of supporting Ukraine in its efforts to restore civil aviation and the willingness of the U.S. to provide expert and technical assistance. International airlines, including LOT Polish Airlines, SkyUp Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air, and others, also joined the discussion on opening airspace in Ukraine during martial law. On April 11, 2023, the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) published a seven-year forecast that included the likelihood of restrictions over Ukrainian airspace remaining in place until 2029. The State Enterprise for Air Traffic Services said in 2023 that Ukrainian airspace &quot;will reopen after the war ends.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-presents-roadmap-for-opening-airspace-during-martial-law/	2024-10-30T09:26:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1238442755.jpg

Ukraine never wanted to seize Kursk nuclear Power Plant, Zelensky says	Ukrainian forces never intended to seize the Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast following Ukraine&apos;s incursion into the region in early August, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during an interview with Nordic media on Oct. 30. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kyiv of attacking or planning to attack the plant since the start of the Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast, which Ukraine has flatly denied. &quot;Russia thinks they are very strong, but if we wanted to seize their nuclear power plant (Kursk Nuclear Power Plant), we would have done it, we could have done it, but we never wanted to do it. Because we understand that it would mean becoming the same as Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;We are not occupying their critical infrastructure, as they did with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.&quot; The plant lies roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Ukrainian-held positions in Kursk Oblast, according to the DeepState monitoring site. The purpose of the Kursk operation was to create a buffer zone to protect the Ukrainian border, the president added. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but has recently faced mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. Moscow has transferred around 50,000 soldiers from other sectors of the front to Kursk Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 10. North Korean troops may join the Russian military in this front-line area soon, as confirmed by NATO and the Pentagon. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military said that they had recorded North Korean troops in the area but did not engage them in combat.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-never-wanted-to-seize-kursk-nuclear-power-plant-zelensky-says/	2024-10-30T08:21:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/-------_---.jpeg
Russian bank offers preferential mortgages in occupied parts of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk oblasts	Russia&apos;s VTB Bank has opened applications for preferential mortgages in the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine&apos;s Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, the state-controlled Interfax news agency reported on Oct. 30, citing the bank&apos;s press service. Moscow has launched incentives for Russian citizens to settle in the occupied territories while thousands of Ukrainians fled, aiming to Russify the conquered land. The Russian banking giant offered interest rates as low as 2%, according to Interfax, and plans to expand its offer to the occupied territories in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts as soon as &quot;housing constructions&quot; start there. Russia&apos;s war has laid waste to the Ukrainian cities and villages, leaving many of them in ruins. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the illegal annexation of the four aforementioned oblasts in September 2022. Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have been occupied since the start of the Russian aggression in 2014. Kyiv says peace talks should be held on the condition of Russia&apos;s full withdrawal from Ukraine. VTB specified that the 2% annual rate would be fixed for the entire loan term, up to 30 years, with an initial payment of 10.1% of the housing price and loan amounts reaching up to 6 million rubles ($62,000). The partially state-owned bank&apos;s decision comes after Putin&apos;s call on banks to expand their services in the occupied territories at the beginning of 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-vtb-bank-offers-preferential-mortgages-in-occupied-ukrainian-territories/	2024-10-30T07:18:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1238687055.jpg

Ukraine is bracing for its toughest winter yet, with half of its energy infrastructure in ruins after Russia launched massive campaigns against the country&apos;s energy grid in the autumn-winter period of 2023-2023, and again in the spring of 2024. Between March and August of this year, Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-denies-russia-ukraine-talks-on-halting-energy-strikes/	2024-10-30T06:28:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Slovak PM interviewed by top Russian propagandist	Slovakia&apos;s Prime Minister Robert Fico gave an online interview to chief Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, with parts published on Skabeyeva&apos;s Telegram channel on Oct. 30. Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow&apos;s talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war. Talking to the propagandist sanctioned by several Western countries, the prime minister of a NATO and EU member country discussed several topics, including the Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the supposed Western fatigue over the support of Ukraine. Fico also reiterated his desire to visit Moscow for the May 9 Victory Day celebrations. Based on the snippets published on Skabeyeva&apos;s channel, Fico claimed that in April 2022, real agreements were on the table that could immediately end the war. The unsuccessful talks in 2022 held in Belarus and Turkey were the only occasion when Ukraine and Russia took part in direct negotiations. A resulting draft treaty, which reportedly precluded Ukraine from joining NATO and postponed the matter of occupied territories, was never signed due to disagreement on several key points and a shifting tide on the battlefield. &quot;And today we all look at this war, and I feel, excuse the frankness, we look away and say: Here are your weapons, here is your money, fight, just don&apos;t bore us with it, we just don&apos;t want to have anything to do with it anymore, with this war,&quot; the Slovak prime minister said. Fico expressed skepticism over earlier reports that the Nord Stream pipeline was blown up by Ukrainian officers, calling the allegation &quot;nonsense.&quot; He also said it was his personal duty to visit Moscow on the 80th anniversary, marking the end of the Second World War.	https://kyivindependent.com/slovak-pm-interviewed-by-top-russian-propagandist/	2024-10-30T06:08:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Fico.png
No confidentiality between partners — Zelensky calls out White House over Tomahawk missiles leak	Ukraine&apos;s request for Tomahawk missiles was &quot;confidential information,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 30, complaining about a lack of confidentiality between Kyiv and Washington. The New York Times reported on Oct. 29 that, according to undisclosed U.S. officials, the request for Tomahawk missiles with a range of 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) was part of the secretive &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; included in Ukraine&apos;s victory plan. The sources told the outlet that Washington was unconvinced that Ukraine needed the weaponry and was reluctant to supply them due to their limited numbers. &quot;It was confidential information between Ukraine and the White House. How to understand these messages?&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing with journalists from Nordic countries. &quot;So this means (that) between partners, there is no (confidentiality).&quot; According to Zelensky, Ukraine requested the missiles on the condition that it would deploy them only if Russia refused to end its war and de-escalate. &quot;I said that this is a preventive method. I was told that it is an escalation,&quot; Zelensky said. Kyiv has been trying to secure additional assistance from U.S. President Joe Biden before he leaves office in January. There are fears that Washington might scale down its support if Republican nominee Donald Trump wins the election on Nov. 5. Facing Russian military advances and increasingly uncertain Western support, Zelensky pitched the five-step victory plan, containing steps that should supposedly end the war by 2025. Some points of the plan were met with a lukewarm response from partners, with the White House still refusing to permit long-range strikes on Russian territory and several countries resisting a NATO invitation for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-calls-out-white-house/	2024-10-30T05:32:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173586535.jpg
MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak: Developments in Ukraine’s parliament on economic reforms, international obligations — Issue 79	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 78 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief&#x201D; newsletter, covering events from Oct. 21- Oct. 27, 2024. The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Ukraine&apos;s parliament will consider the accounting chamber reform in the second reading and the draft law on the 2025 State Budget. During the parliamentarian meetings scheduled for Oct. 21-31, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, will consider draft law #10044-d on reforming the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine. The budget committee prepared and approved the text for the second reading last week. The draft law is not only a structural benchmark of the latest memorandum with the International Monetary Fund, but an obligation for U.S. financial assistance with a deadline of the end of October. As we reported in Issue 72, the draft law suggests establishing a transparent competitive selection of the chamber&apos;s members with participation and the decisive vote of international experts, extending the mandate of the accounting chamber to all public finances and strengthening its independence. Moreover, the parliament will consider draft law #12000 on the State Budget for 2025 after the budget committee revised all amendments submitted by lawmakers. The Committee&apos;s meeting was scheduled for Oct. 28. The results of voting for new members of the Bureau of Economic Security Civil Oversight Council had to be announced on Monday. On Oct. 27, an online competition for the new Bureau of Economic Security&apos;s Civil Oversight Council was closed. Forty-four candidates took part in the competition. The list of nine winners had to be announced and published on the Bureau of Economic Security official website on Oct. 28. After that the Cabinet of Ministers should officially appoint these &#xA0;winners as members of a new Civil Oversight Council of the ESBU for the next two years. At the time of sending this newsletter on Oct. 28, the results had not yet been announced. The draft law on a tax increase has not been signed for two weeks. On Oct. 15, draft law #11416-d on tax increase which was considered as urgent by the Presidential Office still hasn&#x2019;t been signed for 14 days. It seems that President Volodymyr Zelensky is going to sign the bill so that it can come into force from Nov. 1. Such a step will prevent businesses from implementing legal collisions when the increased military levy has to be paid only for several days of October. The president signed two draft laws required in the Ukraine Plan. Last week, the President signed draft law #10143 with amendments to the bankruptcy code to improve bankruptcy procedures and harmonize them with the EU legislation. The adoption of this bill is also required by the World Bank Development Policy Financing (DPF). The president also signed draft law #11310 on the basic principles of state climate policy. The parliament will consider a draft law on plea agreements, the deadline has already passed. During the parliamentarian meetings scheduled for Oct. 21-31, the Verkhovna Rada will consider draft law # 12039 to improve the mechanism of plea bargaining in grand corruption cases. The deadline for this step has expired in September. As we reported in Issue 77, the revised draft law allows for a shorter prison term than currently required in case of cooperation with the investigation through exposure of accomplices and compensation for damage. This mechanism can&#x2019;t be applied as a general rule to organizers of corruption schemes, with the exception of cases where such an organizer exposes another organizer. The president signed the draft law on publishing detailed prices of SOEs&#x2019; construction procurements. The President signed the draft law #11057 on changes in public procurement procedures for the state-owned enterprises. The draft law suggests provision on mandatory publication of breakdown of costs for every construction contract following public procurement in order to ensure transparent pricing and prevent inflated prices. Zelensky announced cash payments to Ukrainian citizens to spend on locally produced goods. President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Cabinet of Ministers to allocate government funding for every Ukrainian to receive Hr 1,000 (around $24) by Dec. 1 to be spent on domestically-produced goods or services. Speakers who had to advocate the initiative were instructed to explain the decision with the fact that international financial support could not be used for military purposes, and such a step is meant to boost consumption.	https://kyivindependent.com/mp-yaroslav-zhelezniak-developments-in-ukraines-parliament-on-economic-reforms-international-obligations-issue-79/	2024-10-30T04:48:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky.jpeg
Ex-Google CEO urges US to buy drones instead of 'useless' tanks, cites Ukraine experience	The U.S. military should replace its &quot;useless&quot; tanks with AI-powered drones, Google&apos;s former CEO Eric Schmidt said on Oct. 30, Bloomberg reported. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia, Schmidt said that Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine showed how a &quot;$5,000 drone can destroy a $5 million tank.&quot; According to Forbes, Schmidt has been quietly building a startup in the U.S. and Ukraine for the production of military drones. The White Stork project aims to manufacture unmanned aerial vehicles using artificial intelligence and resistant to GPS jamming, the outlet wrote. The former chief executive of Google and ex-chairman of its parent company, Alphabet, is also backing the startup Istari, which seeks to modernize the U.S. military with cutting-edge AI technology. &quot;The cost of autonomy is falling so quickly that the drone war, which is the future of conflict, will get rid of eventually tanks, artillery, mortars,&quot; said Schmidt, who has been an advisor to U.S. defense officials on emerging technologies. Schmidt believes that Western militaries are adapting too slowly to new technology trends of the modern-day battlefield. Ukraine and Russia have pioneered drone technology throughout the full-scale war. Kyiv, in particular, has been using cheaper drones in innovative ways to offset its limited resource pool compared to Moscow or NATO militaries. Ukrainian drones have been used to devastate the Russian Black Sea Fleet, drop molten metal on Russian positions, and intercept Russian helicopters. Some military experts warned against dismissing traditional weapon systems like tanks as obsolete, however. &quot;The wars in Ukraine and Nagorno-Karabakh (in 2020) both show that mobile armored platforms with firepower are still important,&quot; defense expert Rob Lee wrote in a War on the Rocks article. The analyst connected the tank losses Russian forces suffered in the early phase of the war to inadequate use of combined arms and weak logistics.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-google-ceo-urges-us-to-buy-more-drones/	2024-10-30T04:47:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1328571734.jpg
North Korean soldiers 50 km from Ukraine's border, including special forces, FT reports	Around 3,000 North Korean troops that arrived in Kursk Oblast were housed in barracks only 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29, citing undisclosed Ukrainian intelligence officials. A few hundred of those are special forces, with the rest being regular troops, one source said. North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine and deployed them in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28. Recent reports suggest that a small number may already be in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence estimated the number of troops to be around 10,000, while Ukraine put the total number at 12,000. According to the Financial Times, Ukrainian intelligence officials are skeptical regarding the combat effectiveness of the troops and cite communication issues with their Russian counterparts as a main hurdle Moscow and Pyongyang will have to bridge. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has also been urging China to use its relationship with Pyongyang and apply pressure on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. North Korea&#x2019;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region has dramatically gained pace in recent days, with analysts saying Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-soldiers-50-km-from-ukraines-border-ft/	2024-10-30T03:44:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
South Korea reportedly not considering direct 155 mm ammunition supplies to Ukraine	South Korea is currently not considering directly providing 155 mm artillery shells to Ukraine, the Yonhap news agency reported on Oct. 30, citing a senior South Korean presidential official. Seoul has not received such a request from the Ukrainian side, and the matter is not under consideration, the source told the South Korean news agency amid speculations of South Korea&apos;s shifting stance on the issue. South Korea has not provided direct lethal support to Kyiv as its legislation prohibits supplying arms to a warzone, though unconfirmed reports suggested Ukraine has obtained South Korean shells indirectly via the U.S. The country&apos;s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, said South Korea might revise its stance in the light of deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea, namely in regards to the dispatch of North Korean troops to join the war. A South Korean delegation is expected to visit Ukraine this week to share intelligence on North Korean soldiers and discuss mutual cooperation. Kyiv also plans to send a special envoy to South Korea, and the two countries will discuss the topic this week, Yonhap reported. &quot;It will take a day or two for the Ukrainian side to designate a special envoy and finalize a plan to visit and hold discussions here,&quot; the official told the news agency. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition shells. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. Ukrainian officials said that simply holding the front against Russian forces requires 75,000 shells a month. Moscow&apos;s troops can fire several times more shells than Ukraine, with roughly half reportedly provided by North Korea. Russia is also believed to be preparing the deployment of 12,000 North Korean troops, with at least some of them in combat roles. A small number of North Korean soldiers have already arrived in Ukraine, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing Western intelligence.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-shells-ukraine/	2024-10-30T03:19:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175191081.jpg
Georgian prosecutors open investigation into election fraud allegations	Georgia&#x2019;s Prosecution Service said on Oct. 30 that it would open an investigation into mounting reports of the falsification of the parliamentary elections held on Oct. 26. The ruling Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party declared victory with 54% of the vote, despite accusations by international observers and domestic oppositions about rigged elections. &quot;The Prosecution Service of Georgia has launched an investigation into the alleged falsification of the parliamentary elections,&quot; the statement read on Oct. 30. The office summoned President Salome Zurabishvili for Oct. 31 as part of the investigation. The president refused to acknowledge the result, calling it a &quot;Russian special operation&quot; and urged voters to protest. Many Georgians heeded her call and took to the streets to protest the result and the alleged fraud. While most exit polls indicated a victory for a pro-European coalition, the official results claimed that oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili&apos;s Georgian Dream had won with 53.9%. The opposition coalition received 37.8%. Numerous foreign and domestic observers provided evidence of large-scale voting fraud, accusing the authorities of stealing the opposition&apos;s victory. The government, which has been run by Georgian Dream for 12 years, denied the accusations. &quot;The Prosecution Service of Georgia will conduct all necessary investigative and procedural actions to study the facts raised in the CEC&apos;s (Central Election Commission) statement, as well as those mentioned by the President of Georgia, certain political parties, and the representatives of election observation missions,&quot; the prosecutors&apos; statement read. The Election Commission said it would recount votes at a few arbitrarily selected polling stations to address the accusations. All four parties of the pro-European opposition coalition said they would refuse to join the new parliament due to the alleged vote rigging. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze rejected the accusations of vote rigging in an interview with BBC on Oct. 28 and added that &quot;irregularities happen everywhere, in every country.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-prosecutors-open-investigation-into-election-fraud-allegations/	2024-10-30T02:32:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180900189.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 4, injure 41 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least four people and injured at least 41 over the past day, including children, the regional authorities reported on the morning of Oct. 30. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 33 of the 62 Russian Shahed-type drones launched overnight, according to the Air Force. Twenty-three of the drones were &#xA0;reported as &quot;lost.&quot; Russia launched yet another drone attack against Kyiv. Fallen debris damaged a multi-story residential building, starting a fire and injuring nine people, including a child, the city&apos;s authorities reported. Russian attacks on Donetsk Oblast killed one person in the village of Sukhi Yaly and injured 10 elsewhere in the oblast, Governor Vadym Filaskin reported. Five people were wounded in the village of Oleksievo-Druzhkivka, two in the town of Myrnohrad, and the remaining three in Kurakhove, Lyman, and Druhkivka. In Kharkiv Oblast, four people were injured in Russian attacks, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A 39-year-old woman was reportedly injured in the village of Tsaredarivka. Two women aged 68 and 74 and a 10-year-old child were also wounded in the village of Bezruky, the governor reported. Russian strikes against Kherson Oblast killed three people and injured 15, said the regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Moscow&apos;s forces targeted critical infrastructure facilities, an educational institution, a store, and residential areas. Three people were injured in attacks against Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration reported. One resident was wounded during attacks against the Velyka Pysarivka community on Oct. 29, and two civilians were injured in the Khotin community overnight on Oct. 30. Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytskyi, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-102/	2024-10-30T02:14:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kyiv-Oct-30.jpg
Death toll of Russia's Kryvyi Rih strike on Oct. 28 rises to 2	The death toll of a Russian missile attack against the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Oct. 28 has risen to two as a man died in the hospital, a local official said on Oct. 30. &quot;Unfortunately, a 55-year-old man died at 8:50 a.m.,&quot; said Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the city&apos;s military administration, on his Telegram channel. The devastating attack damaged 11 apartment buildings, a medical clinic, a school, an administrative building, 10 garages, and a gas pipeline. Initially, one person was reported as killed and 14 people as injured, 10 of whom were hospitalized. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. With a population of around 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city lies about 70 kilometers northwest of the nearest front-line zone. Russia has launched a number of aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities over the past few days, namely targeting Kyiv and Kharkiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/death-toll-of-russias-kryvyi-rih-strike-on-oct-28-rises-to-2/	2024-10-30T01:41:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-28-17_08_54.jpeg
Russian hackers targeting US officials, Microsoft warns	Russian hacker group Midnight Blizzard has been sending highly targeted phishing emails to U.S. individuals working in government, academia, defense, and non-governmental organizations, Microsoft warned in a blog post on Oct. 29. The warning came exactly a week before the U.S. presidential election, with U.S. intelligence accusing Russia of interference to undermine the Democratic ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. During the campaign, detected by Microsoft on Oct. 22, thousands of emails were sent to more than 100 organizations. According to Microsoft, the goal of the ongoing operation is likely intelligence gathering. &quot;Based on our investigation of previous Midnight Blizzard spear-phishing campaigns, we assess that the goal of this operation is likely intelligence collection,&quot; Microsoft said. The hacker group has been linked by the United States and the United Kingdom to Russia&apos;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Their activity dates back to 2018, and they usually target governments, diplomatic entities, NGOs, and IT service providers, primarily in the United States and Europe. Phishing emails use social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients. They exploit emotions like fear, urgency, or curiosity to trick them into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. These emails often impersonate trusted entities, such as banks or government agencies, making them appear legitimate and increasing the likelihood of victim response.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-hackers-targeting-us-officials-microsoft-warns/	2024-10-30T01:26:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-615824148.jpg
Ukraine should strike back if North Korean troops cross into its territory, Biden says	U.S. President Joe Biden said Kyiv should strike back at North Korean troops &quot;if they go into Ukraine&quot; during a press conference on Oct. 29. A Pentagon spokesman added at a separate briefing that Moscow&#x2019;s recourse to North Korean troops reflects a &quot;dire situation&quot; of its manpower. North Korea had sent troops to Russia to participate in its war against Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28. U.S. intelligence estimated the number of troops to be around 10,000, part of whom is already deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;I am concerned about it, yes,&quot; Biden answered to a question regarding their arrival, adding that Ukraine should strike back if the troops enter into Ukrainian territory, but did not elaborate further. In a separate news briefing on Oct. 28, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said a &quot;relatively small number&quot; of North Korean troops are already in Kursk, echoing recent comments by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who said thousands more troops are expected to head there in the coming weeks. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation. North Korea&#x2019;s entry into the war comes when Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region has dramatically gained pace in recent days, with analysts saying Moscow&apos;s forces are advancing at a pace not seen since the early months of the war.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-north-korean-troops-ukraine/	2024-10-30T00:29:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174506605.jpg
Chechnya drone strike: Kadyrov claims to use Ukrainian POWs as human shields	Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov on Oct. 29 apparently boasted about using Ukrainian prisoners as human shields, claiming there were casualties among the captives after a drone strike on Chechnya. The Russian Special Forces University of Vladimir Putin in the Chechen city of Gudermes was damaged by a drone attack early on Oct. 29, marking the first drone strike against Russia&apos;s North Caucasus republic. Putin&apos;s ally Kadyrov, who accused Ukraine of the attack, initially said that the targeted building was empty and there were no casualties, only to change his statement later on and claim that Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) were killed as a result. Kyiv did not claim responsibility for the attack nor commented on Kadyrov&apos;s claims. &quot;Up to 10 Ukrainian prisoners are held at each strategic facility in the (Chechen) republic, including on the territory of the Russian Special Forces University,&quot; Kadyrov claimed on his Telegram channel. The use of prisoners as human shields is banned under the Geneva Convention and classified as a war crime. &quot;Kyiv, trying to harm us, killed its own soldiers today,&quot; the dictator said, providing no evidence to back his allegations. The Kyiv Independent has reached out to Ukraine&apos;s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs) for comment but has not received a response at the time of the publication. A Ukrainian intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 29 that the drone strike was possibly launched from the neighboring republics of Dagestan or Ingushetia and may have been connected to a feud between Kadyrov and officials from the two regions. Speaking to the media after the strike, Kadyrov also said that he ordered all of his commanders fighting against Ukraine &quot;not to take prisoners and destroy&quot; Ukrainian soldiers as retribution. Ukraine has documented over 100 cases of Russia summarily executing Ukrainian POWs since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets clarified that the actual number is likely much higher since it is difficult to document Russian war crimes without supporting evidence, such as videos of the executions.	https://kyivindependent.com/kadyrov-claims-to-use-ukrainian-pows-as-human-shields/	2024-10-30T00:18:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/2024-05-06-22_34_26.jpg

This number includes 1,560 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,137 tanks, 18,433 armored fighting vehicles, 27,840 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,955 artillery systems, 1,242 multiple launch rocket systems, 986 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,979 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-693-640-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-29T23:14:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175040445.jpg
Russian drone debris hits residential building in Kyiv, 9 injured	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian drones targeted Kyiv during an overnight attack on Oct. 30, city authorities reported. Nine people were injured in the incident, including an 11-year-old girl, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko. Debris from a drone attack had fallen in Kyiv&apos;s Solomianskyi district, causing a fire in a multi-story residential building, the Kyiv City Military Administration said. Eighteen residents were evacuated from their apartments. The fire has since been extinguished. &quot;Rescue services are working on the spot. Medics are also on duty on the spot,&quot; Klitschko wrote on Telegram. Just a few days ago, a Russian suicide drone hit a 25-story residential building in the same district on Oct. 25, killing a teenage girl and injuring five people.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-debris-hits-residential-building-in-kyiv-9-injured/	2024-10-29T23:06:32-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/kmva2.jpg
Hungarian FM to attend and speak at Eurasian security conference in Belarus this week	Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto is set to speak at the Minsk Conference on Eurasian Security in Belarus on October 31, Politico reported. Other participants will include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Bassam al-Sabbagh. Representatives from 45 countries are expected. According to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), the event should be viewed as a competitor to the Munich Security Conference. The CSTO was established in 2002 and includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Russia is by far the most powerful member of the alliance, which is similar to NATO in its structure. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry has indicated that the event will focus on discussing and shaping future Eurasian security. Szijjarto frequently visits Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Minsk, emphasizing Hungary&apos;s reliance on Russian energy during a recent seminar organized by Gazprom. He was the first high-ranking EU official to visit Belarus in 2023, following the government&apos;s crackdown on opposition and support for Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, he has been the only EU foreign minister to visit the country. Hungary has remained the most Kremlin-friendly country within the EU and has repeatedly opposed Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO and the European bloc, obstructed sanctions on Russia, and undermined Western aid efforts for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungarian-fm-to-attend-and-speak-at-eurasian-security-conference-in-belarus-this-week/	2024-10-29T21:21:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2155704049.jpg
Ukrainian and Russian officials to resume discussions on stopping energy plant attacks, FT reports	Ukraine and Russia are reportedly holding preliminary discussions about stopping attacks on each other&apos;s energy infrastructure, the Financial Times reported on Oct. 29. Earlier talks mediated by Qatar in August nearly reached an agreement but fell through after Ukraine&#x2019;s incursion into Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. Discussions, in the early stages, are expected to resume sometime soon. Moscow remains firm that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from Kursk before any agreement is made. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in early August, allegedly seizing around 100 settlements and over 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles). Russia began a counteroffensive in the region in September, with reportedly minimal success. According to a senior Ukrainian official, energy infrastructure attacks have already decreased in the past few weeks, based on a deal established through Ukraine and Russia&#x2019;s respective intelligence agencies. With winter approaching, Ukraine faces critical energy challenges due to the prior damage inflicted by extensive Russian strikes. Between March and August of this year, Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-and-russian-officials-to-resume-discussions-on-stopping-energy-plant-attacks-ft-reports/	2024-10-29T20:00:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2167778055.jpg
Mediazona confirms identities of over 75,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Through open-source research, Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet, together with BBC Russia, confirmed the names of 75,382 Russian soldiers who had been killed since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Since Mediazona&apos;s last update in mid-October, the names of 2,483 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The last few weeks, amid ongoing battles in Ukraine&apos;s eastern oblasts as well as in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian forces have experienced some of its heaviest losses since the start of the full-scale war. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Oct. 25 reported 1,630 Russian casualties in the previous day marking Russia&apos;s second deadliest day since the start of full-scale war. The numbers surpassed the previous second-highest tally of 1,530, which was set a week prior. The bloodiest day for Moscow&apos;s forces was on May 13, when they suffered a reported 1,740 casualties. According to some experts, the surge in losses in recent months may be one of the factors behind the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia, which reportedly began fighting alongside Russian forces in limited numbers on Oct. 29. Since Russia began its all-out war against Ukraine over 4,200 officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. The analysts also note that at least 14,095 Russian convicts have been killed on Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. According to Mediazona&apos;s estimates, a majority of those killed in action come from Rostov, Sverdlovsk, Bashkiria, and Chelyabinsk oblasts, as well as the Buryatia republic. A surge of recruitment by the Kremlin in the predominantly Muslim regions of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan have also showed an increase in those killed in action in recent months. As of Oct. 29, 2024, the Ukrainian military estimates Russian combat losses at 692,080 troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/mediazona-confirms-identities-of-over-75-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-10-29T16:37:54-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1249450973.jpg
Ukraine facing 'most difficult' winter since start of full-scale war, Ukrenergo chief says	The interim head of Ukraine&apos;s state grid operator Ukrenergo, Oleksiy Brekht, said on Oct. 29 that the country may be facing its most challenging winter since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, as Ukraine prepares for more Russian attacks against energy infrastructure. &quot;The winter will be the hardest of the previous three years,&quot; Brekht told Suspilne in an excerpt of an interview published Oct. 29. Brekht said that if Russia continues its onslaught of attacks against critical energy infrastructure as it did last winter, then Ukrainians may face up to eight hours of power outages on the most &quot;critical&quot; days. Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow is preparing to carry out strikes against Ukrainian nuclear facilities ahead of the winter months, as it seeks to plunge the country into a lasting cold aimed at breaking Ukrainians&apos; resolve. Previously, Serhiy Kovalenko, the CEO of energy supplier Yasno, warned in June that Ukrainians may have electricity for just 6-7 hours per day in the winter, depending on how much of the grid can be repaired Between March and August of this year, Russia destroyed all thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 25 during his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. During the interview, Brekht said that Ukraine lost 9 gigawatts (GW) in generating capacity earlier this year due to Russian attacks. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on September 19 that the EU aims to cover around 4.5 GW of energy capacity this winter, or roughly 25% of Ukraine&apos;s winter needs. Earlier in the day on Oct. 29, the EU said that it will increase their export capacity to 2.1 GW starting Dec. 1. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 GW this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. Despite the concern of officials, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sept. 10 the country has protected 85% of its energy infrastructure in anticipation of further Russian attacks. Brekht&apos;s comments echo made by NATO&apos;s Secretary General Mark Rutte on Oct. 8 who also warned that &quot;massive strikes&quot; against Ukrainian infrastructure may disrupt energy production.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-is-facing-the-most-difficult-winter-since-start-of-war-ukrenergo-chief-says/	2024-10-29T15:50:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2154248575.jpg
US urging China to pressure North Korea to withdraw troops from Ukraine's front line, CNN reports	United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has been urging China, which maintains relations with North Korea, to put pressure on Pyongyang to withdraw North Korean troops from Ukraine&apos;s front line, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing a U.S. official. According to the unnamed official, Sullivan &#x201C;directed the US government to engage the PRC to organize an effort to get other countries to reach out to the PRC as well over our concerns about DPRK sending troops into Russia and the implications of that&#x201D; &#x2014; using PRC to refer to the country&apos;s full name as the People&apos;s Republic of China. CNN reported on Oct. 29 that a small number of North Korean forces are already on the territory of Ukraine, citing two Western intelligence officers. NATO and the Pentagon previously confirmed that North Korean troops were training in Russia and that some of them were on their way to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, part of which Ukrainian forces have controlled since August. Speaking at a press conference on Oct. 28, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller confirmed that the U.S. has been in contact with China about North Korea troop presence alongside Ukraine&apos;s front line, but did not provide detail on the conversations. &#x201C;We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,&#x201D; Miller said. Estimates on the number of North Korean troops sent to the Ukraine-Russia front line have varied. U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December, while Kyiv has said that Pyongyang has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Despite the urging of the United States, some Western officials are pessimistic about the country&apos;s ability to pressure China into helping pull back North Korean troops, with a NATO official telling CNN that China has been a &quot;critical enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. China&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s defense industry has played a significant role in shifting the battlefield momentum in Ukraine in Moscow&apos;s favor. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine On Oct. 24, China denied that it was of any North Korean troops inside Russia preparing to join Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite warnings from the U.S. and South Korea. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia &#x2013; allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-urging-china-to-pressure-north-korea-to-withdraw-troops-from-ukraines-front-line-cnn-reports/	2024-10-29T14:28:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gettyimages-1151086996-612x612.jpg
Georgia sinks deeper into Russian-style authoritarianism amid stolen election allegations	Georgia&apos;s Oct. 26 parliamentary election presented a clear geopolitical choice for the country&#x2019;s voters, but criticism is mounting that the ruling regime stole the vote. After years of vacillating between the West and Russia and paying lip service to European integration, the country&apos;s ruling Georgian Dream party began to mimic the Kremlin&#x2019;s playbook, tarnishing the country&#x2019;s relations with the West. While most exit polls indicated a victory for a pro-European coalition, the official results claimed that oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili&apos;s Georgian Dream had won with 53.9%. The opposition coalition received 37.8%. Numerous foreign and domestic observers provided evidence of large-scale voting fraud, accusing the authorities of stealing the opposition&apos;s victory. The government, which has been run by the Georgian Dream for 12 years, denied the accusations. All four parties of the pro-European opposition coalition said they would refuse to join the new parliament due to vote rigging, and the country&apos;s pro-European President, Salome Zourabichvili, took the unprecedented step of refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the election. Citizens of Georgia take part in Parliamentary Elections in Tbilisi, Georgia, on Oct. 26, 2024. (Nicolo Vincenzo Malvestuto/Getty Images)Yet the ruling party appears set to preserve its grip on power for now. &quot;(If the Georgian Dream&apos;s victory holds), Georgia will be a satellite state of Russia &#x2013; a mix of Belarus and Chechnya, a fully autocratic regime,&quot; Marika Mikiashvili, a Georgian analyst and member of the Droa opposition party, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;(The Georgian Dream) has realized that the only way for them to maintain their power is to ally themselves with Russia.&quot; EU foreign ministers said in a joint statement on Oct. 28 that they &quot;condemn all violations of international norms for free and fair elections&quot; and &quot;demand an impartial inquiry of complaints and remedy of the violations established.&quot; &quot;The violations of electoral integrity are incompatible with the standards expected from a candidate to the European Union,&quot; they said. &quot;They are a betrayal of the Georgian people&#x2019;s legitimate European aspiration. Upholding the rule of law and free and fair elections is integral to any progress on Georgia&#x2019;s EU path.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also condemned &#x201C;all contraventions of international norms&#x201D; in the Georgian election on Oct. 28 and joined &#x201C;calls from international and local observers for a full investigation of all reports of election-related violations.&#x201D; What happens next remains unclear. Opposition politicians and activists have hoped that protests could force the Georgian Dream to hold a new election. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Tbilisi on Oct. 28, making their demands heard. Much depends on whether protests or Western pressure will force the Georgian Dream to audit the election results or hold a new vote. The Georgian Dream did not respond to requests for comment. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze rejected the accusations of vote rigging in an interview with BBC on Oct. 28 and added that &quot;irregularities happen everywhere, in every country.&quot; Georgia&apos;s central election commission agreed on Oct. 29 to recount votes at a small number of randomly selected polling stations. The Georgian Dream&apos;s opponents point to the discrepancy between most exit polls and the official results as evidence of massive vote rigging. An exit poll ordered by the pro-government channel Imedi estimated the Georgian Dream&apos;s result at 56%, while several other exit polls commissioned by opposition TV channels, including one conducted by U.S. polling agency Edison Research, put the number at around 40%. Georgian election analyst Levan Kvirkvelia published charts that he says prove voting fraud in the election. &quot;Voting results typically follow a bell curve &#x2014; this is called a normal distribution,&quot; he said on X on Oct. 28. &quot;Any deviation from this pattern needs explanation... In the rural areas, there&apos;s an unusual &apos;tail&apos; on the right, hinting at fraud, often called the &apos;Russian tail.&apos; This pattern suggests ballots were stuffed or miscounted.&quot; Georgian oligarch and founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party Bidzina Ivanishvili (C) and Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze (R) react during a gathering at the party&apos;s headquarters after exit polls were announced during parliamentary elections in Tbilisi, Georgia on Oct. 26, 2024. (Giorgi Arjevanidze / AFP via Getty Images)George Melashvili, founder of the Europe-Georgia Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that the scale of voting fraud was bigger than in previous elections, saying that &quot;this election was stolen from the Georgian people.&quot; David Sakvarelidze, a top prosecutor in Georgia under ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili, agreed, telling the Kyiv Independent that &quot;nobody expected such blatant lawlessness.&quot; Sakvarelidze, an opponent of the Georgian Dream, moved to Kyiv after Saakashvili lost power in 2013 and served as a deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine from 2015 to 2016. President Zourabishvili said on Oct. 27 that the Georgian Dream government was illegitimate and called the election a &quot;complete falsification.&quot; &#x201C;We were not just witnesses but also victims of what can only be described as a Russian special operation &#x2013; a new form of hybrid warfare waged against our people and our country,&quot; she added. Opposition lawmakers and their supporters alleged that Russia was involved, either as an inspiration for the steal or as a direct participant. Bloomberg reported on Oct. 21, citing documents it had obtained, that Russian spies had been watching Georgia&#x2019;s government and major companies in a comprehensive espionage and hacking campaign over years.

(Giorgi Arjevanidze / AFP via Getty Images)During the election campaign, the Georgian Dream tried to drive home the message that a victory for the opposition would mean war with Russia, showing pictures of war-torn Ukraine. &quot;There was a hysteric campaign to scare Georgians with the threat of war and demonize Ukraine and (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky,&quot; Sakvarelidze said. Despite its declared victory, the Georgian Dream is facing a number of stumbling blocks. All the four opposition parties elected to parliament refused to join it due to voting fraud. The president&apos;s refusal to recognize the new parliament was also a major blow to its legitimacy. According to Georgia&apos;s Constitution, &quot;parliament shall acquire full powers once this is acknowledged by two-thirds of the members of parliament.&quot; The Georgian Dream will not have two-thirds, and some commentators interpreted this to mean that parliament will not be able to function. But Prime Minister Kobakhidze said that parliament would start working despite the opposition&apos;s refusal to join it. Mikiashvili and Melashvili said that parliament would not have full powers without two thirds of the MPs but it would still be able to function under the Constitution. Parliament will be able to pass most laws without a two-thirds majority but will not be able to change the Constitution or impeach the president, according to Mikiashvili. &quot;It will be a North Korean-style one-party parliament, but technically, it will be able to function,&quot; Melashvili said. Moreover, it is not clear how long the opposition coalition&apos;s unity will continue and whether some of the opposition lawmakers will decide to join the new parliament. After the 2020 election, the opposition also initially boycotted the parliament but later reached a compromise with the Georgian Dream and joined it. Another factor that may affect future political developments in Georgia is the West&apos;s position. The European Union has expressed concern over reports of massive voting fraud. &quot;We... call on (Georgia&apos;s) Central Election Commission and other relevant authorities to fulfill their duty to swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof,&quot; Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said on Oct. 27. Mikiashvili said that the West should refuse to recognize the rigged election and impose sanctions on the Georgian authorities. Sakvarelidze said that &quot;the EU has been turning a blind eye to the Georgian government&apos;s violations&quot; and called on the West to &quot;take decisive action.&quot; &quot;If you don&apos;t shake hands with (the Georgian Dream), they will be uncomfortable,&quot; he said. The Georgian opposition and pro-West political commentators believe that election fraud and the increased hostility between the country and the West will push Georgia into Russia&#x2019;s arms. Melashvili said, however, that it would be hard for the Georgian Dream to set up a full-blown dictatorship because it had failed to achieve its goal of receiving a constitutional majority in parliament. He argued that the Georgian Dream would try to perpetuate &quot;creeping pro-Russian authoritarianism similar to Hungary and Serbia.&quot; &quot;This election is the last chance to catch up with Ukraine and Moldova on their path to European integration,&quot; Melashvili added. &quot;If the Georgian Dream succeeds in stealing the election, Georgia&apos;s European integration will be halted.&quot; Georgian political analyst Gela Vasadze told the Kyiv Independent that the scenario of a pro-Russian dictatorship was possible but said that &quot;Georgian (civil) society would have to be destroyed to implement such a scenario.&quot; People attend an opposition rally where Georgia&apos;s President Salome Zurabishvili protests results of the parliamentary elections that showed a win for the ruling Georgian Dream party outside the parliament building in central Tbilisi, Georgia, on Oct. 28, 2024. (Mirian Meladze/Anadolu via Getty Images)Georgia&apos;s pro-Russian driftFrom 2004 until 2012, Georgia was run by then-President Saakashvili&apos;s pro-Western government, which implemented reforms to liberalize the economy and crack down on corruption. Saakashvili&apos;s government was in constant conflict with Russia, which increased its hold on the country&#x2019;s two autonomous regions &#x2013; Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In 2008, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country, fully establishing control over the two now breakaway regions. Saakashvili&#x2019;s domestic support plummeted following the war and the political scandals that occurred during his time in office. The Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party won the 2012 parliament elections in a landslide, while the country moved from a presidential to a parliamentary system. The Georgian Dream kept the goal of joining the European Union and NATO but also declared plans to improve relations with Russia. &quot;You can&apos;t succeed in Georgia if you don&apos;t promise European integration,&quot; Mikiashvili said. &quot;For many years (the Georgian Dream) maintained strategic ambiguity and portrayed themselves as pro-European.&quot; Melashvili said that &quot;the Georgian Dream was trying to sit on two chairs and create a perception of European integration.&quot; People attend an opposition rally where President Salome Zurabishvili protests the parliamentary election results outside the Tbilisi parliament, Georgia on Oct. 28, 2024. (Mirian Meladze/Anadolu via Getty Images)The Georgian Dream government concluded an association agreement with the EU in 2016 and achieved visa-free travel with the EU in 2017. Georgia received EU candidate status in 2023. But in recent years, the Georgian Dream has stepped up anti-Western and pro-Russian rhetoric and moved towards closer ties with the Kremlin. It has also adopted some Russian-style measures to obstruct the work of liberal non-government organizations and cracked down on LGBTQ+ rights. Amid the improving relations with Tbilisi, Russia introduced visa-free travel with Georgia and canceled the ban on direct flights. Business ties have also improved. As a result of the pro-Russian drift, the EU suspended accession talks with Georgia, and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Georgian officials in June 2024. Pro-Western anti-government demonstrations have also become a regular occurrence in the country&#x2019;s capital. Melashvili said that the Georgian Dream became more pro-Russian during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;They were sure Kyiv would fall and were preparing for a reality in which Russia would be dominant,&quot; he said. &quot;But this is at odds with what the Georgians wanted.&quot; Mikiashvili argued that the Georgian Dream would not have been able to stay in power if it had implemented pro-Western democratic reforms and moved out of Russia&#x2019;s orbit. In that case, they would have likely been ousted in a democratic election, she added. &quot;Russia is their only guarantee for staying in power,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgia-sinks-deeper-into-pro-russian-authoritarianism-critics-say-citing-stolen-election/	2024-10-29T13:52:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180430858.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia claims capture of Selydove, Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Key developments on Oct. 29: Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 29 that its forces had captured the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, which lies close to the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukraine has not commented on the claims. Observers and the Ukrainian military have warned of an increasingly difficult situation in the town as Russian forces have been pushing forward over the past few weeks. While Kyiv did not confirm whether Russia captured the town, an expert told the Kyiv Independent that Selydove is effectively &quot;lost.&quot; &quot;There can be some Ukrainians in the western parts, but the city is basically lost,&quot; said Emil Kastehelmi, a military expert and open-source intelligence (OSINT) analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group. &quot;That&apos;s the biggest city to fall after Avdiivka in the winter. And it fell in a couple of weeks or so. So it was a quick, quick move.&quot; The Ukrainian military said on Oct. 29 that it had repelled 11 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk sector, including near Selydove. The town&apos;s fall would spell dire news for Pokrovsk, which lies only around 18 kilometers (11 miles) northwest. Russian forces have been inching toward Pokrovsk for the past couple of months, with their push in Donetsk Oblast recently gaining a long-unseen pace. Selydove was home to around 21,000 people before the full-scale invasion in 2022. Russia&apos;s offensive, accompanied by artillery barrages and heavy aerial bombardment, has driven thousands of civilians from their homes. A small number of North Korean forces are already on the territory of Ukraine, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing two Western intelligence officers. NATO and the Pentagon previously confirmed that North Korean troops were training in Russia and that some of them were on their way to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, part of which Ukrainian forces have controlled since August. There was no confirmation of the presence of North Korean troops in Ukraine before. &quot;It seems that a good many of them are already in action,&quot; one of the officials told CNN, referring to the North Koreans. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. U.S. and South Korean diplomatic and military officials will meet in Washington this week to discuss North Korea&apos;s &quot;expanding relationship with Russia,&quot; said U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak is also currently in Washington. According to CNN, he met with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and State Secretary Antony Blinken on Oct. 29. Yermak mentioned that he and Sullivan discussed &quot;North Korean soldiers whom Russia is preparing for war.&quot; How helpful the North Korean military will be to the Russian army on the battlefield is not yet clear. Many of the North Korean troops are special forces, and intelligence assessments suggest that Pyongyang believes its troops have greater combat power than regular Russian troops because they are better trained and specialized, officials told CNN. The North Korean military has not been involved in a war for over 70 years, and intelligence officials believe the North Korean government sent them there largely so they could gain combat experience. Officials also expect that at least some of the soldiers will desert their units once they are on the battlefield and that the language barrier with the Russians will be a significant obstacle to smooth operations. The Russians are teaching North Korean soldiers basic Russian commands in training, such as &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;back to your position,&quot; South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Oct. 29. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia &#x2013; allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. Ukrainian military intelligence reported on Oct. 24 that approximately 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia and undergoing training at five military bases. Three Russian soldiers will be assigned to every group of 30 North Korean fighters, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency reported on Oct. 25, citing an intercepted conversation between service members of a Russian brigade in Kursk Oblast. However, doubts remain in the Russian army about the possibility of carrying this out in practice. President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for Tomahawk missiles from the U.S. as part of the &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; in his victory plan, the New York Times reported on Oct. 29, citing undisclosed U.S. officials. Zelensky&#x2019;s victory plan comprises five points with three classified parts. The third point refers to non-nuclear deterrence, a part of which is classified. Ukraine is proposing a &quot;comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its territory&quot; that would safeguard the country against future aggression, a part of which would consist of receiving Tomahawk missiles, according to the Times&apos; report. Tomahawk missiles have a range of more than 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles), seven times the range of the long-range missile systems called ATACMS that Ukraine received from the U.S. According to the officials, Ukraine did not manage to convince Western diplomats why it needed Tomahawks. The number of Ukraine&#x2019;s targets in Russia also allegedly far exceeds the stockpiles the U.S. could hand over without jeopardizing its interests in the Middle East and Asia. The outlet also cites four U.S. officials who claimed Zelensky was surprised that U.S. President Joe Biden did not grant him permission to use U.S. long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia when they met in Washington in September. This was confirmed by Zelensky&apos;s office. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 28, the Yonhap news agency reported. Yoon&apos;s comments come shortly after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28 that North Korea had sent troops to Russia following a meeting with South Korean defense and intelligence officials. &quot;I hope that under Secretary General Rutte&apos;s leadership, NATO will redouble efforts to monitor and block illegal exchanges between Russia and North Korea in solidarity and coordination,&quot; Yoon said. The growing North Korean support for Russia&apos;s war, namely the dispatch of troops, sparked discussions in South Korea on revising internal legislation to allow military supplies to Ukraine. Yoon added that the South Korean delegation will brief the EU Political and Security Committee on Oct. 29, after which they will travel to Ukraine to meet with intelligence and defense officials to exchange battlefield information and explore cooperation measures. &quot;It is a grave situation where the actual deployment of North Korean troops to the front lines in Ukraine could happen sooner than expected,&quot; Yoon commented. Romania could shoot down aircraft illegally violating its airspace based on the level of threat, according to a draft law published by the Romanian Defense Ministry on Oct. 28. Bucharest reported numerous cases of Russian drones crashing on its territory or violating its airspace near the Ukrainian border following mass strikes on Ukraine. According to the proposed legislation, the Romanian military would be able to intercept and, when necessary, destroy piloted and unmanned aircraft breaching its airspace under certain circumstances. The document must be approved by the Romanian government and the parliament. Depending on the level of threat, &quot;unauthorized&quot; drones may be disabled or taken control of with &quot;non-kinetic&quot; means or shot down. The interception of a piloted aircraft would follow several steps, including establishing radio contact, transmitting instructions to the pilot, and firing a warning shot. The use of &quot;destructive force&quot; by aircraft or ground-based air defenses would be the last resort. The Romanian military would attempt to shoot down the aircraft only after establishing all the circumstances and the level of threat and taking into account international law and the safety of people&apos;s lives and property, the document says. Allied forces stationed in Romania would be permitted to take part in the operations. Romania has urged NATO partners to present a &quot;robust and coordinated&quot; response to Russian missiles and drones violating the allied airspace. Latvia and Poland also reported similar breaches. Ukraine has urged NATO to intercept Russian drones and missiles over Ukrainian airspace both to protect Ukraine and their own countries. No country has committed to that step so far nor intercepted Russian projectiles in its airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-claims-capture-of-selydove-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2024-10-29T12:52:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/DSCF6203.jpg
Fire breaks out at Slovak factory producing artillery shells for Ukraine	The premises of the ZVS Holding company, which produces artillery shells for Ukraine and other contractors, caught fire in the Slovak city of Snina, Slovak news outlet Dennik N reported on Oct. 29. The fire broke out at 1:30 p.m. local time in a hydraulic press used for the three-dimensional molding of steel shell casings. By late afternoon, it had engulfed the oil tank and part of the roof of the production hall and had been localized. As a result of the fire, two plant workers were poisoned by combustion products. The company has not yet identified the cause of the fire, saying that it will be possible to determine it after the fire is completely extinguished. There is also no estimate of the damage or impact on the production itself. ZVS holding added that no explosives are used at the Snina plant. All the shell casings are filled at another facility in Dubnica nad Vahom, where the semi-state enterprise&apos;s main operation is located. Ukraine has long tried to ramp up domestic ammunition production to become more independent from Western partners. In the summer of 2023, Ukroboronprom said that it had already mastered the production of 82 mm mortar mines, 122 mm, and 152 mm artillery rounds, as well as 125 mm tank shells. Earlier media reports cited Ukrainian officials hoping to begin producing &quot;desperately needed&quot; NATO-standard 155 mm artillery rounds in the &apos;second half&apos; of 2024 at the earliest. The Ukrainian government announced in September that Ukraine already produces its own 155 mm artillery ammunition. Despite domestic efforts, the Ukrainian army still mainly depends on supplying 155 mm shells from partners as European countries join forces to buy the rounds outside Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/fire-breaks-out-at-slovak-factory-producing-artillery-shells-for-ukraine/	2024-10-29T12:42:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1251756590.jpg
Small number of North Korean troops already in Ukraine, CNN reports	A small number of North Korean forces are already on the territory of Ukraine, CNN reported on Oct. 29, citing two Western intelligence officers. NATO and the Pentagon previously confirmed that North Korean troops were training in Russia and that some of them were on their way to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, part of which Ukrainian forces have controlled since August. There was no confirmation of the presence of North Korean troops in Ukraine before. &quot;It seems that a good many of them are already in action,&quot; one of the officials told CNN, referring to the North Koreans. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. U.S. and South Korean diplomatic and military officials will meet in Washington this week to discuss North Korea&apos;s &quot;expanding relationship with Russia,&quot; said U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak is also currently in Washington. According to CNN, he met with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and State Secretary Antony Blinken on Oct. 29. Yermak mentioned that he and Sullivan discussed &quot;North Korean soldiers whom Russia is preparing for war.&quot; How helpful the North Korean military will be to the Russian army on the battlefield is not yet clear. Many of the North Korean troops are special forces, and intelligence assessments suggest that Pyongyang believes its troops have greater combat power than regular Russian troops because they are better trained and specialized, officials told CNN. The North Korean military has not been involved in a war for over 70 years, and intelligence officials believe the North Korean government sent them there largely so they could gain combat experience. Officials also expect that at least some of the soldiers will desert their units once they are on the battlefield and that the language barrier with the Russians will be a significant obstacle to smooth operations. The Russians are teaching North Korean soldiers basic Russian commands in training, such as &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;back to your position,&quot; South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Oct. 29. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia &#x2013; allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. Ukrainian military intelligence reported on Oct. 24 that approximately 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia and undergoing training at five military bases. Three Russian soldiers will be assigned to every group of 30 North Korean fighters, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency reported on Oct. 25, citing an intercepted conversation between service members of a Russian brigade in Kursk Oblast. However, doubts remain in the Russian army about the possibility of carrying this out in practice.	https://kyivindependent.com/small-number-of-north-korean-troops-already-in-ukraine-cnn-reports/	2024-10-29T12:06:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029632286.jpg
Who is Sergei Kiriyenko, Russian hawk reportedly in touch with Elon Musk?	Late last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk, the U.S.-based oligarch with extensive influence on American politics, had been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022. The revelation came weeks after reports that similar calls were potentially made by former U.S. President Donald Trump, the current Republican Party nominee who is heavily backed by Musk. The former and potentially future U.S. president did not support nor accept the claim that he spoke to Putin after the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both of these stories focused on the alleged direct line of communication between Putin allegedly and those who could influence the U.S. response to Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war in Ukraine. However, they also mentioned several Russian characters that slipped from the public eye. One of Musk&#x2019;s alleged points of contact was a less-known Russian official, Sergei Kiriyenko, according to the WSJ. Unknown to the general public outside Russia, Kiriyenko, Putin&#x2019;s first deputy chief of staff, holds enormous sway over the Kremlin&#x2019;s war effort and its control of Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. He is also one of the clearest cases of how a Russian liberal morphed into a government-employed technocrat and later a pillar of President Putin&#x2019;s regime. Sergei Kiriyenko is no stranger to politics. He accepted his first government position in Russia&#x2019;s energy ministry in 1997, having previously headed the Norsi oil company in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod. Then, in 1998, Kiriyenko was promoted to Russian Prime Minister in a dramatic government shakeup. He was just 35 years old: the youngest prime minister in the country&#x2019;s history. At the time, Kiriyenko was heralded as a &#x201C;young reformer&#x201D; alongside politicians such as Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov &#x2014; someone who could tackle Russia&#x2019;s dire economic problems. But Kiriyenko&#x2019;s tenure was short-lived. Four months into his tenure, an ongoing economic crisis led to Russia failing to pay off its debt. He ultimately resigned in August 1998 after Russia declared a sovereign default. Yet, the former youngest prime minister with the shortest tenure in the country&#x2019;s history wasn&#x2019;t done with politics. He was a major supporter of liberal economic reforms. Kiriyenko continued to work closely with Nemtsov, founding a political party, the Union of Right Forces, to run in Russia&#x2019;s 1999 parliamentary elections. The group struggled to make an impact at the ballot box and less than a year later Kiriyenko ultimately accepted a series of posts from the newly-elected president &#x2013; Vladimir Putin. In May 2000, he was named Presidential Envoy to the Volga Federal District; five years later, he was appointed the head of Rosatom, Russia&#x2019;s Federal Atomic Energy Agency. These posts were far from the Moscow decision-making centers, to which Kiriyenko was close in the late 1990s. Yet, following Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the lives of two former allies, Kiriyenko and Nemtsov, took a drastic turn. Nemtsov, by then a vocal critic of Putin&#x2019;s regime, was assassinated near the Kremlin in 2015. A year later, Kiriyenko became the first deputy head of Putin&#x2019;s administration.

(Contributor/Getty Images)Dr. Maria Snegovaya, a senior fellow with the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), describes Kiriyenko&apos;s rise &#x2014; and his ideological flexibility &#x2014; as typical for careerists in the late Soviet Union. She highlights Kiriyenko&#x2019;s willingness to serve as the first secretary of the Soviet regional Komsomol Committee even as the USSR was actively disintegrating. &#x201C;At the time, people who went into the system did not believe in Communist ideals, but they were and remain statists. They believed in serving the Russian state,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Such ambitious individuals typically were intent on making a career under any leadership regardless of specific ideals or values.&#x201D; From the early 1990s onwards, Kiriyenko has remained loyal to a tumultuous kaleidoscope of regimes, from Yeltsin&#x2019;s pro-Western government to Putin&#x2019;s revanchist state. It is this dedication to the state, rather than ideology, that is valuable to the Kremlin. Many such willing and politically malleable officials now sit at the top of Russia&#x2019;s power structure. It is not only ideological flexibility that has allowed Kiriyenko to flourish under a Putin government, but his ability to reinvent himself within the Kremlin&#x2019;s closed system. Kiriyenko&#x2019;s original tasks focused on elections and domestic policy. But as the Kremlin&#x2019;s attention has shifted, the now 62-year-old bureaucrat has also sought to broaden his domain. Kiriyenko has become a key figure in administering Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, leading the rollout of sham referendums. Independent Russian news outlet Meduza reported that Kiriyenko secured that post in a personal meeting with Putin himself, where he laid out his &#x201C;vision&#x201D; for newly occupied territories. Family ties are also expanding Kiriyenko&apos;s reach. Kiriyenko&#x2019;s son, Vladimir, was appointed CEO of Russian social media site VKontakte &#x2014; a company in turn controlled by the Russian state-owned Gazprombank &#x2014; in December 2021, at the age of 38. &#x201C;This demonstrates that Putin sees Kiriyenko as his reliable associate. Putin needs to find replacements from reliable cadres, and gradual inheritance of status is a natural feature of autocratic neo-patrimonial systems such as Putin&apos;s, which do not allow outsiders in,&#x201D; Snegovaya says. Kiriyenko has also reportedly played his own role in Russian digital policy. In September, the U.S. Justice Department publicly linked Kiriyenko to 30 internet domains that appeared to be legitimate American news sites but were instead created specifically to amplify Russian propaganda. Kiriyenko has been on the radar of Western officials for some time. If the WSJ findings are true, Musk&#x2019;s calls would link him to a man under U.S., EU, and U.K. sanctions.

(Jim Watson / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;Musk owns what is probably still the most influential social media platform in terms of reaching people who shape opinion on domestic and foreign policy,&#x201D; says Dr. Ruth Deyermond, a senior lecturer in Post-Soviet Security in the Department of War Studies at King&apos;s College London. &#x201C;The fact that the man who owns X may be in contact with Russian officials, including individuals who are linked to accounts pumping out disinformation on X, is extremely worrying.&#x201D; Kiriyenko&#x2019;s current reach across a variety of fields makes him one of the key bureaucrats in Putin&#x2019;s Russia. The control of occupied parts of Ukraine is one sphere where Kiriyenko has been able to make himself indispensable to the Kremlin. According to experts, attempting to influence U.S. policy toward Ukraine would be very much on Kiriyenko&#x2019;s radar. Meanwhile, Musk is a U.S. security contractor, working with the U.S. government in areas such as satellite launches. He supplies Starlink internet terminals to the Ukrainian army. Domestically, he is also heavily involved in the current contentious U.S. presidential race, and has shared his ideas on Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine &#x2014; views that many see as echoing those of Putin and his regime. &#x201C;(Occupied) Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Soviet leader Nikita) Khrushchev&#x2019;s mistake,&#x201D; Musk famously wrote as a proposal, repeating the Russian narrative that the occupied peninsula was Russian for the taking. &#x201C;For the Russian government, Musk gives a unique prize. He has a unique skill set for anyone who is interested in influencing those kinds of things (like U.S. defense policy or politics),&#x201D; Deyermond says. &#x201C;Getting Musk on side, persuading him or encouraging him to adopt their point of view and to act in ways that would benefit them, that would be a huge, huge success for the Russian government.&#x201D; Tesla CEO Elon Musk (R) joins former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a campaign rally at site of his first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, U.S. on Oct. 5, 2024. (Jim Watson / /AFP via Getty Images)Ultimately, while alleged contact with a man such as Kiryenko &#xA0;&#x2014; a technocrat with no outspoken political beliefs, an individual generally happy to remain in the background &#x2014; may seem less sinister than meetings more vocal, hawkish Russian figures, the fluid, interconnected nature of Russia&#x2019;s authoritarian government means that any links could pose risks. &#x201C;Russia is an authoritarian state. You don&apos;t have to be in the Russian government to be operational on behalf of the Russian government. That&#x2019;s true in any authoritarian state, it&apos;s been particularly an issue in Russia,&#x201D; says Deyermond. &#x201C;(Allegedly,) Musk has been talking to people who are in the wider Kremlin circle and who have been seen to be operating in ways that benefit the Russian government. Even if it was unclear that these were pro-Kremlin individuals or Kremlin agents, (they are) in effect, extensions of Kremlin policy.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/who-is-sergei-kiriyenko-the-liberal-turned-russian-hawk-reportedly-in-touch-with-elon-musk/	2024-10-29T11:48:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-841559856.jpg
Ukraine facing 'grim' situation in Donetsk Oblast, as Russia claims capture of Selydove	Ukraine faces a &quot;pretty grim&quot; situation in Donetsk Oblast in the east of the country as Russian forces make some of their swiftest advances since the summer of 2022, according to experts and OSINT analysts. &quot;The last week has been extremely difficult for the Ukrainians &#x2014; the Russians were able to breach the Ukrainian defenses in various areas,&quot; Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group, told the Kyiv Independent. Russia&apos;s long and grinding campaign in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donbas region has dramatically gained pace in recent days, with Kastehelmi saying Moscow&apos;s forces have advanced &quot;faster than it has been any time after the summer of 2022.&quot; &quot;So we&apos;re looking at really large movements on the front lines, especially when put into the context of this whole full-scale invasion,&quot; he added. Russia&#x2019;s Defense Ministry on Oct. 29 claimed the capture of Selydove, a town close to the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. While Kyiv has yet to comment on the situation, experts and OSINT analysts have all but confirmed the town has fallen. The Deep State OSINT project map based on data from Oct. 28 showed most of Selydove under Russian control, with around a third depicted as a disputed gray zone. An analysis of Deep State data by the independent Russian news outlet Agentsvo said Russia had taken 196.1 square kilometers (75.7 square miles) during the week of Oct. 20-27. &quot;The Russian army has not had such a rapid weekly advance since at least the beginning of this year,&quot; it said in a post on Telegram. Throughout 2024, Ukraine has faced a challenging situation in defending frontlines stretching from the country&#x2019;s northeast to southern regions, &#xA0;particularly in the far eastern Donetsk Oblast, where Russia has consistently concentrated its offensive. Following Ukraine&apos;s withdrawal from Vuhledar in early October, Russian forces have been focusing their efforts against the Donetsk Oblast towns of Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and Kurakhove, where outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure. And the fall of Selydove would be dire news for Pokrovsk, lying only around 18 kilometers (11 miles) northwest, towards which Russian forces have been inching for the past couple of months. &quot;The city of Selydove is now most likely totally lost,&quot; Kastehelmi said. &quot;There could be some Ukrainians in the western parts, but the city is basically lost. &quot;That&#x2019;s the biggest city to fall after Avdiivka in the winter. And it fell in a couple of weeks or so. So it was a quick, quick move.&quot; According to Kastehelmi, one of the biggest dangers now facing Ukrainian troops is that the positions they are now being forced to fall back to are not as heavily fortified as the positions they&apos;re withdrawing from.

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)Asked if he believed the situation could snowball, he said there&apos;s &quot;a real danger of that.&quot; This would depend on Russian forces having the resources and reserves to exploit potential gaps in the Ukrainian defenses, but Kastehelmi said there haven&apos;t been any signs of that so far. &quot;Even though the Russians have pushed 10 kilometers in a week, we still haven&apos;t seen something that by definition would be a breakthrough.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin still has a long way to go before achieving his stated goal of taking all of the Donbas, Ukraine&#x2019;s far eastern coal mining region. Russia currently occupies all of the Luhansk Oblast, and most of Donetsk Oblast except the last big remaining cities under Ukrainian control, including Pokrovsk, Kostyantynivka to the north, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk further north, and Chasiv Yar to the east. Russia would have to take an additional 10,000 square kilometers (3,860 square miles) of territory to capture all of the Donbas, which, even at the current increased pace, would take just under a year. It&apos;s also not been without a heavy cost for Russian forces. Casualties over October may reach around 40,000, Janek Kesselmann, the deputy commander of the Estonian Military Intelligence Center, said on Oct. 25. But with winter approaching, the uncertainty surrounding next week&apos;s U.S. presidential election and future American weaponry supplies, and Ukraine&apos;s army dealing with its own manpower and morale issues, it&apos;s an especially precarious time for Kyiv. &quot;This is a pretty grim situation for the Ukrainians,&quot; Kastehelmi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-facing-grim-situation-in-donetsk-oblast-as-russia-claims-capture-of-selydove/	2024-10-29T11:43:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2158884934.jpg
Opinion: It’s time to admit the West is already at war with Russia	Another week of Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine has gone by, and Moscow has crossed yet another line with its aggression against Western targets. This time, the violation came in the form of a parcel bomb in the hold of a German aircraft. The device exploded on the ground at a logistics center tarmac rather than in mid-air due only to fortuitous delay. The head of German domestic intelligence told the Bundestag that if the plane had been airborne, it would have crashed. The United Kingdom suspects Russian involvement in a similar incident in July at a DHL depot in Birmingham. Of course, the attempted bombing of a DHL plane is hardly the first incident where Russia has targeted Western aircraft. A decade ago, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, two-thirds of whom were Dutch nationals. Russian proxies in Donetsk Oblast downed the civilian airliner with an anti-aircraft system supplied by Russia&#x2019;s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade on direct orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was also reported that North Korea is supplying half of the artillery shells Russia is using against Ukraine, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is now sending as many as 10,000 soldiers to aid Putin&#x2019;s genocidal war. It&#x2019;s a match made in hell: Putin, fearful of unrest if he orders further mobilization, gains fresh bodies for wave assaults against Ukrainian positions, while Kim receives Russian technical know-how in exchange. Unsurprisingly, some North Korean soldiers deployed in Ukraine have already deserted. Forced into the fight, many likely have little will to sacrifice themselves in meat grinder assaults on the front line. However, expect Kim&#x2019;s soldiers to be prodded forward by Russian forces who will use the same brutality they employ on their own reticent troops. Much as in World War II, Russian blocking brigades mow down retreating soldiers.

(Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Russia&#x2019;s ever-deepening alliances with the world&#x2019;s autocrats and its continuous &#x201C;shadow war&#x201D; against the West are nothing new, yet they are a deeply concerning reality. It&#x2019;s time to admit what most already quietly know: we in the West are already at war with Russia. Yes, thankfully, not a direct full-scale war, but a war that is nonetheless active. If we fail to respond to Putin&#x2019;s ongoing aggression with strength and resolve, this simmering conflict may escalate into a more serious conflagration. German intelligence officials sounded a similar message, warning that &#x201C;direct military conflict with NATO (is) becoming an option for Russia,&#x201D; perhaps as soon as the end of the decade. Western weakness only encourages Russian aggression, and lately the signs are not encouraging. France just announced it will fall well short of its pledge to provide 3 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine in 2024. The Biden administration, meanwhile, will remain wedded to its policy of restricting U.S.-supplied weapons from targeting sites on Russian territory, despite ample evidence that the exact opposite approach is needed. There are, however, glimmers of hope. Putin&#x2019;s need to rely on North Korean troops and to consistently sweeten the pot with larger sign-on bonuses underscores the scale of Russian losses and the challenges he faces in replacing them. Ukrainian officials, for their part, remain confident in their ability to recruit new soldiers, though they express concerns about adequately equipping them. Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and Norway recently announced a new $1.5-billion aid package to Ukraine, which includes air defenses, tanks, combat drones, and artillery. A French project to develop kamikaze drones announced successful tests, with the first 100 units slated for delivery to Ukraine by year-end. South Korea is also reportedly considering direct military aid to Ukraine in response to Russia&#x2019;s use of North Korean troops on the front lines. The outcome of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine and the broader shadow war against the U.S. and its allies remains in the balance. Much will depend on the next U.S. administration&#x2019;s policy decisions. While there are clear pitfalls for either candidate in terms of confronting Russia, the next president has an opportunity to marshal American resolve, and begin tackling an autocratic alliance run amok through a renewed investment in hard power &#x2014; investments that would pay dividends for decades to come. Europe, too, must do some soul searching: its pace of rebuilding defense capabilities and industrial strength is inadequate. The recent near-tragedy in European airspace should serve as a wake-up call for European leaders, whose countries and civilian populations are on the front line of Putin&#x2019;s shadow war. The longer Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine grinds on, the more brazen and reckless the shadow war will become. If Russia succeeds against Ukraine, formalizing into the Russian Federation what it has taken by force, and stymieing Ukraine&#x2019;s pathway to real security guarantees via NATO membership, Germany&#x2019;s warning of a hot war by 2030 may prove prescient. Staving off that future requires leaders in the West to say what we all already know; we are already at war with Russia. Ensuring this war does not expand is not an impossible task, but it will require steely resolve, and a realization that we are likely now astride a fulcrum of history.

German Rheinmetall plant in Ukraine is 'legitimate' target for Russia, Kremlin says	The new factory of German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, which opened in late October in Ukraine, is a &quot;legitimate&quot; target for Russian attacks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian pro-state news agency Ria Novosti on Oct. 29. The facility, which is already operating in Ukraine, is set to produce a batch of Lynx infantry fighting vehicles by the end of the year, according to Papperger. Rheinmetall provides weapons and equipment to Ukraine under contracts with the German government, such as Leopard 1 tanks, mortar shells, and drone surveillance systems. The company previously said it plans to open at least four production plants in Ukraine. The Kremlin&apos;s recent threats were not the first for Rheinmetall, and their facilities are well protected in Ukraine, Reuters reported, citing the company. According to Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger, the company intends to open a second plant in Ukraine &quot;in the near future,&quot; with the production of gunpowder, tank ammunition, and air defense systems in their sights.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-rheinmetall-plant-in-ukraine-is-legitimate-target-for-russia-kremlin-says/	2024-10-29T11:32:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/peskov.jpeg
Kharkiv’s historic skyscraper becomes the latest victim of Russia’s bombardments	Late on Oct. 28, a loud explosion rang out in the center of Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest city. Situated just over 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Russian border, explosions have become part of daily life in Kharkiv as Russia continues to attack the city with drones, missiles, and aerial bombs. This time, the Russian bomb hit an iconic 13-story building situated in the very heart of the city, known as Derzhprom, or the State Industry House. Completed in 1928, Derzhprom was one of the first skyscrapers built in Eastern Europe and is internationally renowned for its constructivist design of reinforced concrete and glass. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest building in the Soviet Union. Preliminary evidence suggested that Russian forces used a FAB-500 aerial bomb fitted with a glide kit &#x2013; a 500-kilogram, high-explosive warhead designed to destroy targets like military headquarters, warehouses, and reinforced concrete structures &#x2013; to hit the nearly 100-year-old building. In 2017, Derzhprom was included in the preliminary list of UNESCO World Heritage, and after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, was placed under provisional enhanced UNESCO protection. The strike injured nine people, severely damaged Derzhprom&#x2019;s facade, and shattered dozens of windows, leaving the offices inside covered in a layer of dust and rubble. &#x201C;For people from Kharkiv, Derzhprom is like our Statue of Liberty, or Eiffel Tower, or Buckingham Palace,&#x201D; Viktoria Grivina, a PhD researcher on Kharkiv at the University of St Andrews and a Kharkiv local, told the Kyiv Independent. The building was constructed when Kharkiv was the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic &#x2013; a short-lived period between 1919 and 1934, after which the capital was moved to Kyiv. &#x201C;Even though it was a puppet state, among intellectual circles there was an aspiration that this new innovative construction would be part of a new Ukraine,&#x201D; Grivina said. The sprawling, 63-meter-high building was originally intended to house Soviet bureaucracy in the modern capital. The architecture reflects this sense of modernism with clean white lines and stark, futuristic glazing, echoing the contemporary Bauhaus art movement and architects like Le Corbusier. The Derzhprom building (also known as the State Industry Building or the Palace of Industry), an example of constructivist architecture, in Freedom Square, Kharkiv, Ukraine, Soviet Union, circa 1935. Completed in 1928 and designed by architects Sergei Serafimov, Samuil Kravets and Mark Felger, the building&apos;s name is a shortening of two words meaning &apos;State Industry.&apos; (General Photographic Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)People walk past the damaged Derzhprom building, a historic Soviet skyscraper, following a missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine on Oct. 29, 2024. (Ivan Samoilov /AFP via Getty Images)Derzhprom is not only a &#x201C;marvelous masterpiece of modern architecture, which still I would say can be compared to a lot of contemporary buildings in the world,&#x201D; but it&apos;s also &#x201C;a miracle of engineering,&#x201D; Jenia Gubkina, a Ukrainian architect and architectural historian from Kharkiv, who now teaches at the Bartlett School of Architecture in London, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;It was one of the main buildings of interwar modernism history, not only Soviet history or Ukrainian history, but world architectural history in the 20th century. You can open any book on the history of 20th-century architecture, and you will find a picture of Derzhprom.&#x201D; &#x201C;In Kharkiv, we are proud of this building as it&apos;s the result of the work of a lot of engineers, mathematicians, economists, politicians, and builders and constructors, not just architects,&#x201D; Gubkina said. Derzhprom&#x2019;s architects were Russian, but the workers perfecting this new reinforced concrete construction were locals, including the head engineer, Pavlo Rottert. &#x201C;So this is a certain point of pride,&#x201D; Grivina added. The motto &#x201C;Kharkiv is reinforced concrete&#x201D; came into prominence after February 2022, when Kharkiv resisted Russia&#x2019;s onslaught despite being so geographically close to the border. Derzhprom reflects the idea that people from Kharkiv are also built &#x201C;from this reinforced concrete, we are people of steel, which is not true, of course, because for us it is still a tremendous blow,&#x201D; Grivina added. The building was heavily damaged in World War II, with Nazi occupying forces attempting to destroy the building as they retreated in August 1943. The reinforced concrete building withstood the damage. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the building underwent years of restoration to restore its former glory. The building &#x201C;wasn&apos;t destroyed during World War II, and now Russians are trying to destroy it,&quot; Volodymyr Tymoshko, the head of the Kharkiv regional police, told a Kyiv Independent reporter on the ground shortly after the strike.

(Ivan Samoilov / AFP via Getty Images)Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov echoed this sentiment, commenting to reporters that &#x201C;not even (Adolf) Hitler was able to do what the Russians have done.&#x201D; Derzhprom is located on Svobody (Freedom) Square, one of the largest squares in Europe. On the other side of the square is the regional administration building, which was targeted in a Russian attack in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion. The missile strike on the regional administration building on March 1, 2022, killed 29 people and, injured 35 others, and left much of the imposing building in rubble. The strike also damaged Derzhprom&apos;s windows. Part of the building was damaged in another attack on the city center in January 2024. The latest strike left the building more scarred than ever. Surveying the broken glass and rubble after the strike, the head of Derzhprom, Mykola Chekhunov, told Suspilne that the repairs to the windows would be tackled first. &#x201C;I love this building. It&apos;s offensive to the point of tears,&#x201D; he added. As of Oct. 16, UNESCO has verified damage to 457 cultural sites in Ukraine, including 231 of historical and/or artistic interest. UNESCO&#x2019;s list of damaged sites in Kharkiv includes the &#x201C;Slovo&#x201D; building, which was constructed in 1929, the Kharkiv Art Museum, the Kharkiv National Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, as well as multiple churches, libraries, and historic apartment buildings. The attacks on cultural heritage are a repeated tactic of Russia&#x2019;s war and represent a tactic of genocide, Gubkina said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not only the killing of children, elderly people, or soldiers, not only the occupation of our land and expropriation of our assets but the destruction of our cultural heritage and built environment and immovable heritage.&#x201D; &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t evacuate cultural sites. They are where they are, unfortunately.&#x201D; The lack of action by international organizations like UNESCO is also disappointing to Kharkiv&#x2019;s architectural community. Derzhprom is included on UNESCO&#x2019;s &#x201C;List of Cultural Property under Enhanced Protection,&#x201D; but according to Gubkina, &#x201C;nobody knows what this status actually means and what kind of specific protection.&#x201D; Both legally and physically, Derzhprom has no protection from Russian attacks. For now, Derzhprom is damaged but still standing. &#x201C;You cannot imagine New York without the Empire State Building, and you cannot imagine Kharkiv without Derzhprom,&#x201D; Grivna said.

EU to increase capacity to export electricity to Ukraine to 2.1 gigawatts ahead of winter	The Transmission System Operators of Continental Europe will increase their export capacity to Ukraine and Moldova by 400 megawatts (MW) to 2.1 gigawatts (GW) starting Dec. 1, according to a statement published on Oct. 29. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23. The damage caused a serious energy deficit and necessitated rolling blackouts across the country. Russian missile and drone attacks have reportedly destroyed 9 GW worth of capacity on Ukraine&apos;s grid. The body said that the decision to increase the capacity for electricity exports was made in response to the destruction of numerous power plants in Ukraine and the expected electricity shortage during the coming winter. The new limit will take effect on Dec. 1, 2024, and operators will be able to review it monthly starting in March 2025. Ukraine will also have an additional 250 MW of guaranteed extra capacity in emergency mode from the European Union, according to the Energy Ministry. National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 15 that Ukraine is preparing for mass Russian attacks against energy infrastructure during the autumn and winter months. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-to-increase-capacity-to-export-electricity-to-ukraine-to-2-1-gigawatts-ahead-of-winter/	2024-10-29T10:56:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1244728337.jpeg
160,000 people planned to be drafted into Ukrainian forces, NSDC Secretary says	A further 160,000 people are to be drafted into the Ukrainian armed forces, which will raise the manning of units to 85%, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 29 during a session of the Ukrainian parliament. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. According to Lytvynenko, 1,000,050 citizens have been drafted into the military so far since the beginning of martial law. Ukraine has been struggling to mobilize enough soldiers for the front line to compensate for troop casualties and the need to rotate soldiers who have been fighting since the onset of the full-scale war. After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. From May 18 to July 16, 4,690,496 military-aged men updated their data by the July 17 deadline, according to the Defense Ministry. Nearly one million people were eligible for exemption in mid-August, according to the Defense Ministry. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in early April that he ordered relevant ministries to introduce &quot;updated, more fair&quot; rules on exempting employees of &quot;critically important&quot; companies from military service. Employees in &quot;strategically important sectors of the economy&quot; will be able to extend their exemption from military conscription, Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers announced on Oct. 26.	https://kyivindependent.com/160-000-people-planned-to-be-drafted-into-ukrainian-forces-nsdc-secretary-says/	2024-10-29T09:51:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2082110119.jpg
Norway announces $127 million compensation for Romanian Patriot sent to Ukraine	Norway will allocate 1.4 billion kroner ($127.4 million) to boost Ukraine&apos;s air defense within the Nansen Support Programme, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Oct. 29. The funds will be used to buy a new Patriot system for Romania to replace the one it handed over to Ukraine on Oct. 3. Bucharest initially hesitated before deciding to donate one of its Patriots in June. The Romanian government issued an order for the system&apos;s delivery in September. &quot;Greater air defense has been one of Ukraine&apos;s most critical needs since the start of the war. Norway&apos;s support to Ukraine is based on what Ukraine needs most, and we will continue to provide support for as long as it is necessary,&quot; said Store. Store added that Norway and the Western allies must increase their support to Ukraine because air defense is one of Ukraine&apos;s &quot;most critical&quot; needs. &quot;Without adequate air defense equipment, Ukraine cannot protect the military installations and forces that are defending the country &#x2013; nor can the country provide protection to children and adults trying to carry on with their lives or safeguard the civilian infrastructure that is to provide electricity and heating throughout the winter.&quot; Norway had earlier given 4 billion kroner ($364 million) to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s air defense, including the purchase of Patriot interceptor missiles, an IRIS-T battery, and the repair of existing air defense systems. Norway also donated a NASAMS system, and its instructors trained Ukrainian operators in using Western air defense systems. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities and energy infrastructure. The highly advanced Patriot systems have played a crucial role in protecting the Ukrainian sky. They are capable of downing even the most advanced ballistic missiles, such as Kinzhals. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each, but no announcement on their arrival has been made so far. The Netherlands is still looking for partner countries to provide components for a Patriot air defense system pledged to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in September.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-to-provide-over-127-million-to-strengthen-ukraines-air-defense/	2024-10-29T09:03:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/776dd4b8cded16f53ab9b6fa5d1552c5_1730142122_extra_large.jpeg
Ukrainian parliament approves resignation of Prosecutor General Kostin	Ukraine&apos;s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted on Oct. 29 to approve the resignation of Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin, lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko said on his Telegram channel. Kostin&apos;s resignation was supported by 255 members of parliament, according to Honcharenko. The Ukrainian government has not yet decided on a replacement for Kostin. Potential candidates allegedly being considered as a replacement for Kostin include Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper and Kyiv Oblast Governor Ruslan Kravchenko, Olena Shcherban, a deputy executive director at the Kyiv-based NGO Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Kyiv Independent. The chief prosecutor submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following a National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) meeting headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The session addressed the &quot;immoral situation&quot; surrounding the fake disabilities of prosecutors, and &quot;many shameful facts of abuse&quot; were revealed, according to Kostin. Following the meeting, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that his agency had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions have been charged with crimes, while another nine suspects had been convicted. Medical examination commissions (MSEK) are bodies tasked with determining the severity of a disability. Corruption schemes at medical examination commissions linked to draft evasion have been reported in Rivne, Mykolaiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kharkiv oblasts. Kostin has served as prosecutor general since July 28, 2022, replacing Iryna Venediktova. Prior to that, he was a member of parliament from 2019 to 2022 and headed the legal policy committee. From 2012 to 2019, Kostin was a deputy chairman of the Odesa Oblast Bar Association. He has been a member of the International Bar Association since 2000.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-parliament-approves-resignation-of-prosecutor-general-kostin/	2024-10-29T07:38:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2168105950.jpg
Zelensky asked US for Tomahawk missiles as part of victory plan's secret part, NYT reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for Tomahawk missiles from the U.S. as part of the &quot;non-nuclear deterrence package&quot; in his victory plan, the New York Times reported on Oct. 29, citing undisclosed U.S. officials. Zelensky&#x2019;s victory plan comprises five points with three classified parts. The third point refers to non-nuclear deterrence, a part of which is classified. Ukraine is proposing a &quot;comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrence package on its territory&quot; that would safeguard the country against future aggression, a part of which would consist of receiving Tomahawk missiles, according to the Times&#x2019; report. Tomahawk missiles have a range of more than 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles), seven times the range of the long-range missile systems called ATACMS that Ukraine received from the U.S. According to the officials, Ukraine did not manage to convince Western diplomats why it needed Tomahawks. The number of Ukraine&#x2019;s targets in Russia also allegedly far exceeds the stockpiles the U.S. could hand over without jeopardizing its interests in the Middle East and Asia. The outlet also cites four U.S. officials who claimed Zelensky was surprised that U.S. President Joe Biden did not grant him permission to use U.S. long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia when they met in Washington in September. This was confirmed by Zelensky&apos;s office.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-asked-us-for-tomahawk-missiles-as-part-of-victory-plans-secret-part-nyt-reports/	2024-10-29T06:58:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161663204-1.jpg
Russia claims capture of Selydove, Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 29 that its forces had captured the town of Selydove in Donetsk Oblast, which lies close to the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukraine has not commented on the claims. Observers and the Ukrainian military have warned of an increasingly difficult situation in the town as Russian forces have been pushing forward over the past few weeks. While Kyiv did not confirm whether Russia captured the town, an expert told the Kyiv Independent that Selydove is effectively &quot;lost.&quot; &quot;There can be some Ukrainians in the western parts, but the city is basically lost,&quot; said Emil Kastehelmi, a military expert and open-source intelligence (OSINT) analyst at the Finland-based Black Bird Group. &quot;That&apos;s the biggest city to fall after Avdiivka in the winter. And it fell in a couple of weeks or so. So it was a quick, quick move.&quot; The town&apos;s fall would spell dire news for Pokrovsk, lying only around 18 kilometers (11 miles) northwest. Russian forces have been inching toward Pokrovsk for the past couple of months, with their push in Donetsk Oblast recently gaining a long-unseen pace.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-capturing-selydove-kyiv-hasnt-confirmed/	2024-10-29T06:34:43-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2169569068.jpg
Drone strike on Chechnya possibly launched from Dagestan, Ingushetia, source claims	A drone strike that damaged the Russian Special Forces University of Vladimir Putin in the Chechen city of Gudermes on Oct. 29 may have been launched from Russia&apos;s neighboring North Caucasus republics, an intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent. The drone attack hit Chechnya early in the morning, marking the first such instance during the war. Footage shared on social media showed significant damage and a fire at the university building, but no casualties were reported. The source&apos;s statement would indicate that the attack was not one of Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes against Russian territory but a result of a local feud. One of the most likely versions explaining the attack links it to the deadly shooting in the Moscow office of the retailer Wildberries in September and a conflict between Kadyrov and lawmakers from the neighboring Caucasus republics, the source said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. The Chechen strongman accused Bekhan Barakhoyev, Suleiman Kerimov, and Rizvan Kurbanov from Dagestan and Ingushetia of plotting to kill him and warned he would call for a &quot;blood feud&quot; if they did not prove their innocence. The accusation was related to the Wildberries shooting, which broke out when Vladislav Bakalchuk, the estranged husband of the company&apos;s founder, tried to &quot;illegally&quot; enter the building with his security guards. Several of those involved come from the North Caucasus, including two killed security guards from Ingushetia. Kadyrov has previously said that he supports Vladislav Bakalchuk&apos;s effort to stop the planned merger of Wildberries with another company. Kadyrov did make no specific accusations when reporting on the drone strike in the morning, adding that an investigation is underway.	https://kyivindependent.com/chechnya-drone-strike-source/	2024-10-29T06:16:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2151325824.jpg
Explosions reported in occupied Luhansk, Ukrainian official suggests ammunition depots hit	Smoke and explosions were recorded in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk on Oct. 29 after what Governor Artem Lysohor called possible strikes on Russian ammunition depots. &quot;Since morning, locals have been sharing footage of detonating ammunition,&quot; Lysohor said, publishing videos recorded by civilians and bystanders on his Telegram channel. Russia has occupied the city of Luhansk, Ukraine&apos;s easternmost regional center, since the start of its aggression in 2014. The videos show thick smoke rising above Luhansk and an explosion. According to Lysohor, Russian forces closed a park in the city where ammunition was stored, which would mean that Russian forces hid materiel in public spaces frequented by civilians. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show a smoke rising over Russian-occupied Luhansk, Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine, after a Ukrainian strike on Oct. 29, 2024. (Governor Artem Lysohor/Telegram)&quot;Today&apos;s explosions will clearly be reflected in front-line combat operations: it will take a lot of time to replenish warehouses and build new logistics routes,&quot; Lysohor wrote. Russian occupation authorities claimed that Ukraine carried out an &quot;unsuccessful missile attack&quot; on Luhansk, using weaponry of an unknown type. Air defenses intercepted the missiles, with some of them exploding in the industrial part of the city, damaging several buildings, Russian proxies and state media alleged. No casualties were reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukrainian forces have been destroying ammunition behind the front lines to slow Russia&#x2019;s advance along the front line, as Moscow&#x2019;s forces advance at a speed not seen since March 2022. In recent months, the Ukrainian military struck ammunition depots in Russia&#x2019;s Voronezh Oblast, near occupied Mariupol, and Toropets in Russia&#x2019;s Tver Oblast, with the latter&#x2019;s explosion picked up on earthquake monitors.	https://kyivindependent.com/luhansk-explosions/	2024-10-29T05:32:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Luhansk-Oct-29.png
Trump's reported plan to 'freeze' Russia's war 'unrealistic,' Ukrainian lawmaker says	A plan reportedly being considered by Donald Trump to freeze Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion if he becomes president is &quot;unrealistic,&quot; a Ukrainian lawmaker told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 29. Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy, said that upon taking office, Trump would soon have to &quot;face reality,&quot; and any such plan would fail in light of political realities. &quot;This plan doesn&#x2019;t look realistic because it implies the agreement of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, who is absolutely unreliable and not trustworthy when it comes to observing any agreements,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time, Putin, as of now, is not interested in negotiations and agreements. He still believes that he can win.&quot; Trump has claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations. Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, in September, outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside NATO, according to a report in the Financial Times (FT) on Oct. 28. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create autonomous zones in Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk Agreement. The new plan will include enforcement mechanisms and consequences for violating the agreement, the adviser said. But, in his opinion, European troops, not NATO forces or U.N. peacekeepers, will have to keep order. Merezhko, a member of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People Party, said the &quot;only solution&quot; to ending the war is to &quot;strengthen Ukraine and thereby force Putin to sit at the table of negotiations.&quot; &quot;In my opinion, the only realistic plan is the &apos;Victory Plan&apos; put forward by President Zelensky.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-plan-to-freeze-russias-war-unrealistic-ukrainian-lawmaker-says/	2024-10-29T04:53:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1229490488.jpg
Opinion: If elections were held today, Poland's pro-democracy coalition could fall	One year after a coalition led by Donald Tusk defeated Poland&#x2019;s right-wing ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), the mood in the country is subdued. While a victory by pro-democracy parties in a free, but decidedly unfair, election was necessary, it was not sufficient to eliminate the illiberal populist threat. Prying PiS&#x2019;s tentacles out of every nook and cranny of the state is proving to be a much longer process. In the meantime, PiS is seeking political advantage from the opposition benches. Were another election to be held today, an estimated 47-48% of eligible voters would go to the polls, which would be one of the lowest turnouts in the last 20 years, and far lower than the record 75% turnout last year. Such findings stand in stark contrast to those of a year ago, when young people voted in droves, particularly young women, and proved to be the decisive factor in PiS&#x2019;s defeat. Almost nothing is left of this previous mobilization. Half of those recently surveyed (51%) identify fairly or very little with the government&#x2019;s program and message. Worse, PiS has retained its support, and support for the far-right Confederation alliance has doubled over the past year. Many Poles still remember that PiS oversaw a wide range of financial transfers, including large child-support and pension payments. A fresh election, according to current polls, would probably replace Tusk&#x2019;s government (which has around 28% support) with a coalition of PiS (30%) and the Confederation (15%). Around 31% of Poles who intend to vote in the next election would choose differently than they did last year. Even more important than any snapshot are the broader trend lines, which increasingly favor the Confederation and disfavor two parties in Tusk&#x2019;s coalition: the Left and Third Way. Although Tusk&#x2019;s Civic Coalition has gained a strong base of voters, the Confederation&#x2019;s gains have been bigger. While 61% of those voting for the Confederation in 2023 want to do so again (and 59% for PiS), only half of Civic Coalition and Left voters are willing to double down on their choice. Supporters of the Left and Third Way are the most disappointed in the results of their victory a year ago. For example, typical supporters of the Left are dismayed that the government has merely introduced administrative changes to decriminalize abortion, rather than legalizing it. This issue matters, because it has become a key indicator of whether Poland is advancing as a modern country or returning to its benighted Catholic past. It doesn&#x2019;t help that the co-ruling Left is dominated by men, despite relying on a predominantly female electoral base.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Other segments of the Civic Coalition&#x2019;s electorate are disappointed by the lack of progress in restoring the rule of law and holding PiS politicians accountable for abuse of power. Most of these efforts have been blocked by the PiS-linked president, Andrzej Duda. Moreover, the state&#x2019;s dwindling coffers make it difficult to offer any quick material benefits to Polish voters, as PiS did. Third Way, for its part, is experiencing a crisis of both engagement and leadership, and it comprises two parties that ultimately are incompatible: Sejm Speaker Szymon Ho&#x142;ownia&#x2019;s Poland 2050 party and Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Kosiniak-Kamysz&#x2019;s conservative Polish People&#x2019;s Party. Each is threatened not only by demobilization of their traditional voters, but also by Tusk&#x2019;s party, Civic Platform, and the Confederation. The Confederation&#x2019;s leader, Krzysztof Bosak, is increasingly popular across many segments of the electorate, commanding the support of half of all men under 40. The party did, however, make a serious mistake by nominating S&#x142;awomir Mentzen as its candidate for the presidential election next year. As a party leader, he is popular with the rank and file, but not with the broader public. Unlike PiS, the Confederation has the potential to attract disillusioned voters from almost any party. It offers a more honest version of right-wing conservatism than PiS does, and it is unencumbered by the former ruling party&#x2019;s innumerable scandals. Some two-thirds of those recently surveyed, including one-third of PiS voters, believe that at least some PiS politicians or officials deserve to be in prison. Among the top names on the list are former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki (who 34% think should be prosecuted); PiS&#x2019;s longtime leader, Jaros&#x142;aw Kaczy&#x144;ski (30%); and former Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro (19%). But Tusk is not blind to the threat that the Confederation poses. His new immigration policy &#x2014; which temporarily prohibits asylum in Poland for applicants from Russia and Belarus &#x2014; is meant to head off the far right. Moreover, a happy ending to the story remains possible. The next presidential election must be held by May 18, 2025, and it could remove the biggest obstacle to the government&#x2019;s progress. The clear frontrunner is Warsaw Mayor Rafa&#x142; Trzaskowski of Civic Platform, who is polling at around 33%, whereas no other candidate exceeds 8%. His election would be the breakthrough that Tusk and the rest of Poland&#x2019;s pro-democracy coalition need. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

Romania's Defense Ministry proposes downing drones violating its airspace	Romania could shoot down aircraft illegally violating its airspace based on the level of threat, according to a draft law published by the Romanian Defense on Oct. 28. Bucharest reported numerous cases of Russian drones crashing on its territory or violating its airspace near the Ukrainian border following mass strikes on Ukraine. According to the proposed legislation, the Romanian military would be able to intercept and, when necessary, destroy piloted and unmanned aircraft breaching its airspace under certain circumstances. The document must be approved by the Romanian government and the parliament. Depending on the level of threat, &quot;unauthorized&quot; drones may be disabled or taken control of with &quot;non-kinetic&quot; means or shot down. The interception of a piloted aircraft would follow several steps, including establishing radio contact, transmitting instructions to the pilot, and firing a warning shot. The use of &quot;destructive force&quot; by aircraft or ground-based air defenses would be the last resort. The Romanian military would attempt to shoot down the aircraft only after establishing all the circumstances and the level of threat and taking into account international law and the safety of people&apos;s lives and property, the document says. Allied forces stationed in Romania would be permitted to take part in the operations. Romania has urged NATO partners to present a &quot;robust and coordinated&quot; response to Russian missiles and drones violating the allied airspace. Latvia and Poland also reported similar breaches. Ukraine has urged NATO to intercept Russian drones and missiles over Ukrainian airspace both to protect Ukraine and their own countries.

Orban lauds Georgia's ruling party for not allowing country to become 'second Ukraine'	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban congratulated the Russian-friendly Georgian Dream party for their disputed electoral victory and for not allowing Georgia to become &quot;a second Ukraine&quot; during his visit to Tbilisi on Oct. 29. &quot;I would like to congratulate you on the fact that, in the context of the desire for European integration, you have not allowed your country to be turned into a second Ukraine,&quot; Orban said at a press briefing with his Georgian counterpart, Irakli Kobakhidze. His words echoed the ruling Georgian Dream party campaign slogan as the &quot;party of peace,&quot; presenting the devastation of Ukrainian cities caused by the invading Russian forces as something that they could avoid by cozying up to Moscow. The ruling party also sought to cast the pro-European opposition&apos;s possible victory as a route to war with Russia. Moscow waged war against Georgia in 2008 and continues to occupy two Georgian regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Orban was among the first leaders to fly to Tbilisi to congratulate, despite international observers, opposition politicians, and the country&apos;s president all crying foul, accusing the ruling party of rigging the vote. Although some exit polls indicated that the pro-European opposition coalition would win the Oct. 26 parliament elections, the ruling Georgian Dream party won 54.08%, while four pro-European opposition groups won only 37.58%. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili refused to acknowledge the results, while the U.S. and the EU called for an investigation after reports of intimidation and irregularities during the election process. Orban&apos;s convoy was booed as he arrived at his hotel while thousands of Georgians took to the streets of downtown Tbilisi to protest the result. The Hungarian prime minister is one of the closest European allies of the Georgian Dream and a vocal critic of the aid for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/orban-in-georgia/	2024-10-29T03:39:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181050787.jpg
3,000 North Korean troops sent to Russian training grounds near front, Zelensky tells South Korean president	President Volodymyr Zelensky held a phone call with his South Korean counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol on Oct. 29 to discuss the transfer of North Korean troops to Russia and a response by Kyiv and Seoul. Pyongyang has reportedly dispatched thousands of troops to aid Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine in a sign of deepening Russian-North Korean cooperation. &#xA0; &quot;I provided my colleague with fresh data on 3,000 North Korean troops transferred to training facilities in the immediate vicinity of the combat zone,&quot; Zelensky said, according to his Telegram channel. This number is expected to rise approximately to 12,000, Zelensky noted, reiterating the figure previously provided by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency. Following a meeting with South Korean officials, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28 that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive. South Korean intelligence said that North Korean troops are likely heading for a front-line deployment, though the Ukrainian military has not yet confirmed encountering Pyongyang&apos;s forces on the battlefield. During the phone call, Zelensky and Yoon agreed to &quot;strengthen the sharing of intelligence and expertise and to intensify contacts on all levels, including on the highest level, to develop a response strategy and a list of countermeasures,&quot; the Ukrainian president said. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine later this week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss mutual cooperation, Yoon said on Oct. 28. A Ukrainian delegation will also visit South Korea, Zelensky revealed. The growing North Korean support for Russia&apos;s war, namely the dispatch of troops, sparked discussions in South Korea on revising internal legislation to allow military supplies to Ukraine. Zelensky also invited South Korea to join the G7 declaration made in Vilnius last year, based on which dozens of countries signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-calls-with-yoon/	2024-10-29T03:01:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162102517.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 8, injure 49 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least eight people and injured at least 49 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Oct. 29. Russia launched 48 drones overnight, of which Ukrainian air defenses shot down 26 across various regions, the Air Force said. Russia attacked Kharkiv&apos;s Osnovyanskyi district with a Grom-E1 hybrid missile overnight on Oct. 29, killing at least four people and injuring two, local authorities reported. Two women and two men were killed in the attack, which also destroyed one house and damaged 19 others, along with four cars, Ukraine&#x2019;s State Emergency Service reported. A Russian FAB-500 bomb struck downtown Kharkiv on the evening of Oct. 28, damaging the landmark Derzhprom building and injuring nine people. Russia also attacked Kyiv with drones overnight on Oct. 29, injuring six people, authorities reported. One of the victims was hospitalized with a serious leg injury. Debris from a Russian drone hit a nine-story apartment building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomyanskyi district in the early hours of Oct. 29, depressurizing a gas pipe, the Kyiv City Military Administration said. A fire spread to a nearby shop and cars, and the gas supply was shut off. Another Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast late on Oct. 28 killed a 39-year-old man and injured 14 people. A civilian died in Myrnohrad, and two were injured in Rozdolne due to Russian attacks in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Kherson Oblast, two civilians were killed and 16 were injured in Russian attacks, including two children. Russian forces targeted critical infrastructure facilities, an administrative building, a library, a post office, and residential areas, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-2/	2024-10-29T02:36:01-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kyiv-Oct-29.jpg
North Korean troops possibly heading to front lines, language barrier causing problems, says South Korea	North Korean troops deployed to Russia may be headed to the front lines, South Korean officials said on Oct. 29 after a briefing by Seoul&apos;s intelligence agency. Speaking at a press briefing, lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun did not say when they would likely arrive on the battlefield and said Pyongyong and Moscow&apos;s troops were being hindered by a language barrier. &quot;The Russian military was teaching the North Korean military some 100 Russian military terms such as &apos;back to your position,&apos; &apos;fire&apos; and &apos;launch&apos;... but the North Korean military was struggling (to understand),&quot; he said in comments reported by Reuters. The assessment comes shortly after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28 that North Korea had sent troops to Russia following a meeting with South Korean defense and intelligence officials. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. The growing North Korean support for Russia&apos;s war, namely the dispatch of troops, sparked discussions in South Korea on revising internal legislation to allow military supplies to Ukraine. A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 28, the Yonhap news agency reported. &quot;It is a grave situation where the actual deployment of North Korean troops to the front lines in Ukraine could happen sooner than expected,&quot; Yoon said. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned earlier this month that Russia intends to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield in the coming days. Ukrainian military intelligence reported on Oct. 24 that approximately 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia and undergoing training at five military bases.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korean-intelligence/	2024-10-29T02:02:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1734340621.jpg
Chechnya hit by drone strike for first time, special forces university damaged, reports suggest	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A drone attack targeted Russia&apos;s North Caucasus republic of Chechnya on Oct. 29 for the first time during Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine, according to claims by dictator Ramzan Kadyrov and media reports. The drone strike hit the building of the Russian Special Forces University named after Vladimir Putin in the city of Gudermes, the independent news outlet Agentstvo reported. Footage shared on social media shows significant damage to the building and a strong fire. Kadyrov claimed that the strike, which took place at 6:30 a.m. local time, merely hit the roof of the university&apos;s empty building, starting a fire but causing no casualties. The fire had been extinguished, the dictator said.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-strike-chechnya/	2024-10-29T01:21:56-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Baza-Chechnya-2.jpg
South Korean delegation to visit Ukraine to share information on North Korean troops	A South Korean delegation will visit Ukraine in the second part of the week to share information on North Korea&apos;s troops in Russia and discuss cooperation, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Oct. 28, the Yonhap news agency reported. Yoon&apos;s comments come shortly after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed on Oct. 28 that North Korea had sent troops to Russia following a meeting with South Korean defense and intelligence officials. &quot;I hope that under Secretary General Rutte&apos;s leadership, NATO will redouble efforts to monitor and block illegal exchanges between Russia and North Korea in solidarity and coordination,&quot; Yoon said. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the full-scale war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. The growing North Korean support for Russia&apos;s war, namely the dispatch of troops, sparked discussions in South Korea on revising internal legislation to allow military supplies to Ukraine. Yoon added that the South Korean delegation will brief the EU Political and Security Committee on Oct. 29, after which they will travel to Ukraine to meet with intelligence and defense officials to exchange battlefield information and explore cooperation measures. &quot;It is a grave situation where the actual deployment of North Korean troops to the front lines in Ukraine could happen sooner than expected,&quot; Yoon commented. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned earlier this month that Russia intends to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield in the coming days.

Zelensky says he 'didn't hear Trump say he would reduce support for Ukraine'	President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 28 that he had never heard U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump say he would cut aid for Ukraine, adding that the Republican nominee &quot;talks a lot.&quot; Speaking at a press conference in Reykjavik, Zelensky said that Ukraine &quot;understands all the risks,&quot; including a possible change in U.S. policy, and is preparing a plan to strengthen the country internally. The president nevertheless added he would still aim to retain the bipartisan support of the U.S. Congress. The comments came only one week before the U.S. presidential election, where Trump will face the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. The vote is expected to have a profound impact on Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine. Responding to a question on the risk of a Trump presidency cutting aid to Ukraine, Zelensky replied, &quot;Trump talks a lot, but I didn&apos;t hear him say he would reduce support for Ukraine.&quot; Though often evasive on the topic of the aid for Ukraine, Trump frequently touts his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the campaign trail and has blamed U.S. President Joe Biden and Zelensky for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion while failing to mention Putin. &quot;Not supporting Ukraine, I believe, will be a great victory for Putin and a loss for the West, democracy, and freedom,&quot; Zelensky said, suggesting that Trump would not want to lose to Putin. The former U.S. president has repeatedly claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. A recent article by the Financial Times (FT) claims that Trump aims to effectively freeze the war and reject Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership in the foreseeable future, at least &quot;until Putin leaves the stage.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-trump-ukraine/	2024-10-29T00:34:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2174930490.jpg

Russian drone attack damages apartment building in Kyiv, injuring 2	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked Kyiv with drones overnight on Oct. 29, damaging a residential building and injuring two people, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. One of the two victims was hospitalized, Klitschko said. The other was treated for her injuries on site. Debris from a Russian drone hit an apartment building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomyanskyi district in the early hours of Oct. 29, causing a fire. Nearby cars and a commercial building also caught fire following the attack, according to Klitschko. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said that emergency gas services had been dispatched to the attack site due to the risk of depressurization of the gas system. Russia has intensified aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s densely populated cities. Other Russian strikes on Oct. 28-29 targeted Kharkiv and Kryvyi Rih, killing several people and injuring over 20. A drone strike against Kyiv on Oct. 25 hit a multi-story building, killing a teenage girl.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-attack-damages-apartment-building-in-kyiv-injuring-2/	2024-10-28T20:11:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/kyiv2.jpg
Russia attacks Kharkiv overnight, killing at least 3	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia attacked Kharkiv&apos;s Osnovyanskyi district overnight on Oct. 29, killing at least three people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Three people were killed in the attack, Syneihubov said. Rescuers are searching for other victims, including children, who may still be trapped under the rubble. The attack occurred around 3 a.m. local time, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. Two houses were destroyed and about 20 more sustained damage. The strike appears to have been made with a KAB guided bomb, Terekhov said. Hours before the latest attack, a Russian FAB-500 bomb struck downtown Kharkiv on the evening of Oct. 28, damaging the landmark Derzhprom building and injuring nine people. &#xA0; The northeastern city of Kharkiv has suffered relentless Russian attacks for over the past two years of Russia&apos;s full-scale war.

Sweden to allocate over $68 million in military aid to Ukraine	Sweden will allocate 729 million Swedish krona (approximately $68 million) in military aid to Ukraine, Stockholm announced on Oct. 28. The announcement came as the leaders of several Nordic countries convened in Iceland for the fourth Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit, during which President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with the prime ministers of Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. Of the total $68 million, about $46.5 million will go towards initiatives supporting Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, the Swedish government said. Another $21.6 million will support the development of the Ukrainian defense industry. The first portion of the funds may be directed towards a number of coalitions established to support Ukraine&apos;s military, including those dedicated to fighter jets, maritime security, mine clearance, and IT. The remaining $21.6 million is allocated for defense industry development under the &quot;Danish model,&quot;a mechanism based on a Danish-Ukrainian agreement that donates arms to Kyiv via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry. Ukraine produced 18 Bohdana howitzers earlier this year via financing from the Danish model. Sweden officially joined NATO in March 2024 after a lengthy application process triggered by Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Upon entering the alliance, Sweden was immediately vocal in its calls for other member states to do more to support Kyiv. The Swedish government announced in May that it plans to allocate 75 billion Swedish krona ($7 billion) in military support to Ukraine from 2024 to 2026. Sweden on Sept. 9 announced a package worth $443 million that included combat boats, anti-tank weapons, ammunition, and Gripen jet spare parts. The Swedish Defense Ministry said at the time that transferring Gripen jets to Ukraine is currently &quot;not a viable option, as it would interfere with the prioritized introduction of F-16 fighters,&quot; but that Stockholm is continuing its efforts to establish the conditions to send Gripen jets to Kyiv in the future.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-to-allocate-over-68-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine/	2024-10-28T19:15:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/sweden.jpeg
Norway's PM announces new 500-million-euro aid package for Ukraine	Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Oct. 28 that Norway will provide Ukraine with a new 500-million-euro ($543 million) aid package, allocating over half for military assistance. Several Nordic countries, including Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, have agreed to provide defense support to Ukraine, including weapons production, assistance in preparing for winter, shelter construction, and support for the victory plan. The Nordic countries have provided Ukraine with more than 20 billion euros ($21 billion) in military, financial, and humanitarian support since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Norway&apos;s Store noted that Northern European leaders received a clear assessment of the front-line situation during their meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky at the fourth Ukraine-Nordic Summit. &quot;The Nordic countries will continue to seek new avenues for supporting Ukraine and its people, while it continues to fight off Russia&apos;s aggression,&quot; reads the joint statement released at the Nordic Summit in Reykjavik on Oct. 28. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided 2.8 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker.	https://kyivindependent.com/norways-pm-announces-new-500-million-euro-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-10-28T17:40:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/776dd4b8cded16f53ab9b6fa5d1552c5_1730142122_extra_large.jpeg
1 killed, 12 injured in Russia's attack on Kryvyi Rih	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Casualties from the Russian missile attack on residential buildings and medical facility in Kryvyi Rih late on Oct. 28 have increased to one dead and 12 injured, Ukrainian authorities report. A 39-year-old man died in the hospital following the attack, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Five people were rescued from the partially destroyed high-rise, according to the National Police. The attack destroyed 12 garages and ignited a fire spread across 500 square meters, affecting a residential building and several outbuildings. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow&apos;s forces have attacked military and civilian sites across the country using missiles and drones. Kryvyi Rih, with a population of around 660,000, is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city is about 70 kilometers northwest of its nearest front-line zone.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-killed-12-injured-in-russias-attack-on-kryvyi-rih/	2024-10-28T15:51:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-28-17_08_54.jpeg
Like Russian opposition itself, Navalny’s posthumous memoir falls short on Ukraine	For Russian liberals, late opposition leader Alexei Navalny represented a glimmer of hope for a democratic future. Yet for many Ukrainians, especially in the context of a decade of war, he was a more complex figure, often casting doubt on whether Russian opposition to Vladimir Putin necessarily aligned with support for Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty. Navalny&#x2019;s memoir, &#x201C;Patriot,&#x201D; which he began writing in Germany after recovering from being poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent in 2020, and continued writing during his imprisonment by smuggling out the notebooks through his lawyers, was released posthumously in English translation on Oct. 22. Its publication has sparked a new wave of accolades for the former opposition leader, who died on Feb. 16 in one of Russia&#x2019;s most notorious penal colonies. &#xA0;His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has been on a major U.S. press tour, with pundits like Rachel Maddow already christening her as the new last hope for a democratic Russia. Navalny returned to Russia in January 2021 after his recovery from being poisoned. He was immediately arrested at the airport, and what followed was a Kafkaesque sequence of fabricated court cases levied against him, coupled with relentless efforts by the authorities to break his spirit. A photo of Alexei Navalny lies among flowers near the Wall of Grief monument in Moscow, Russia on Feb. 17, 2024. (Contributor/Getty Images)From prison, Navalny condemned the full-scale war against Ukraine and acknowledged it was unprovoked, directly challenging Putin&apos;s narrative that justifies the aggression through claims of NATO expansion and the need to protect Russia&#x2019;s &quot;sphere of influence.&quot; His disdain was particularly acute in &#x201C;Patriot&#x201D; when he wrote about how the Russian state-controlled media grotesquely distorted the truth about the Bucha Massacre and attempted to rewrite the tragedy as a fabricated event. At the same time, Navalny also used words like &#x201C;fratricidal&#x201D; to describe the war and wrote that &#x201C;the reasons for (it) are the political and economic problems within Russia, Putin&#x2019;s desire to hold on to power at any cost, and his obsession with his own historical legacy,&#x201D; which ultimately overlooks the genocidal intent behind it, such as the destruction of Ukrainian cultural sites, the forced relocation of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, and &#x201C;re-education&#x201D; programs implemented by occupation authorities. Putin has repeatedly displayed how his tenuous grasp on historical events has influenced his motivation to launch a full-scale war against Ukraine, such as when he declared that Ukraine&#x2019;s claims to sovereignty are not legitimate because it was &#x201C;invented&#x201D; by the Bolsheviks. In his article &#x201C;On the historical unity of Ukrainians and Russians,&#x201D; which was published in 2021, Putin claimed that Ukrainians and Russians were &#x201C;one people, a single whole.&#x201D; For the Russian autocrat, his legacy lies in the forced reunification of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The war cannot be reduced merely to issues like politics and corruption, as Navalny would have had it. The 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine&#x2019;s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are noticeably omitted from Navalny&#x2019;s reflections in &#x201C;Patriot&#x201D; on that year. While the former opposition leader mentioned the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in several passages, those sentences never included that it was taken from Ukraine, a stylistic choice that will no doubt perplex attentive readers familiar with his controversial statements from previous years, including &quot;Crimea is for those people who live in Crimea,&quot; and his quip that it was &quot;not a sandwich to be passed back and forth&quot; between the two countries. Admittedly, Navalny finally acknowledged from prison after the onset of the full-scale war that Ukraine&apos;s 1991 borders should be respected, which would mean the return of Crimea.

(Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images)Navalny does not hesitate to criticize the Soviet system&#x2019;s failures, writing in his memoir that &#x201C;a state incapable of producing enough milk for its citizens does not deserve my nostalgia,&#x201D; a reference to the food shortages under Communist rule. He devotes multiple passages in &#x201C;Patriot&#x201D; to the poor handling of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster and the Soviet-Afghan War of 1979-1989, writing that both events &#x201C;dug the grave of the USSR.&#x201D; At the same time, the closest he comes to mentioning historical injustices committed against non-Russians during the Soviet period, including Ukrainians, is an anecdote from his childhood where he asked his Ukrainian grandmother why she hated Lenin so much. She told him how her family avoided deportation to Siberia, yet their wealth was stripped away with the implementation of collective farming. The iron roof on the family&#x2019;s house, which had supposedly been &#x201C;the envy of the whole village,&#x201D; was taken and sold off, the money &#x201C;spent on drink in the village council,&#x201D; according to family legend. &#x201C;I did not believe that bit at the time,&#x201D; Navalny wrote, &#x201C;but now I have no doubt it was true. Nevertheless, out of respect for my grandmother, I never discussed Lenin with her.&#x201D; Navalny also recalled being shocked as a young boy when his Ukrainian relatives found it funny to joke about spitting on Vladimir Lenin after a visiting cousin was brought to see the embalmed body of the Bolshevik leader in Moscow because they had been taught in Soviet times that he was &#x201C;sacrosanct.&#x201D; Overall, his memories of his childhood summers in Zalissia, a village located just two hours from Chornobyl in Kyiv Oblast, tempt Russian stereotypes of Ukrainians, like how his relatives would &#x201C;tut-tut about what a thin, pale Moscow townie (he) was and how they would have to fatten (him) up with good Ukrainian pork lard.&#x201D; When asked by his family after spending childhood summers with his Ukrainian relatives whether he identified more as Ukrainian or Russian, Navalny wrote that he always &#x201C;did (his) best to avoid a straight answer&#x201D; because such a question was &#x201C;like being asked who you loved more, your mother or father, to which there is no sensible answer possible.&#x201D; To a certain extent, this apolitical sentimentality appears to have carried over with him into his adulthood. Russian opposition politician, anti-corruption campaigner, and founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), Alexei Navalny, is seen on the screen during his legal appeal against his nine-year prison sentence in Moscow&apos;s City Court, on May 24, 2022, in Moscow, Russia. (Contributor/Getty Images)Tensions have been running high between Ukrainians and the Russian opposition over the past decade of Russia&#x2019;s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine. Nearly three years into the full-scale war, prominent figures like Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin &#x2014; who were released in a U.S.-initiated prisoner exchange with Russia over the summer &#x2014; continue to refer to it as &#x201C;Putin&#x2019;s war,&#x201D; a framing which many argue absolves the Russian people of their involvement in a conflict that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Ukrainians and displaced millions. During a speech at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia in early September, Navalnaya also criticized those who renewed the push to &#x201C;decolonize&#x201D; Russia, saying that those who advocate for it &#x201C;can&#x2019;t explain why people with shared backgrounds and culture should be artificially divided.&#x201D; Such a statement is an oversight of the systematic discrimination and cultural marginalization that has existed for some of the more than 190 ethnic minorities that call Russia home. Interestingly enough, Navalny noted in his memoir that his wife &#x201C;holds even more radical views&#x201D; than him, although he did not elaborate in what sense. For the Russian opposition, it has been much easier to shine a light on issues like widespread corruption. In &#x201C;Patriot,&#x201D; Navalny argued that the Russian state&#x2019;s corruption, which has plunged so many of his fellow citizens into poverty, was one of the country&#x2019;s most deeply-rooted obstacles, preventing it from becoming &#x201C;a normal country, a rich one, governed by the rule of law.&#x201D; He went on to repeatedly emphasize throughout the book that &quot;the Russian people are good; it&#x2019;s our leaders who are appalling.&quot; Over the years, Navalny himself made repeated controversial statements that raised concerns among Ukrainians regarding how the Russian opposition viewed relations with Ukraine differently from Putin&#x2019;s regime. When the Orthodox Church of Ukraine was granted autocephaly in 2018, establishing it as an independent religious body from Moscow, Navalny expressed his dismay at the historic event, writing that &#x201C;the Russian Orthodox Church will lose up to half of its &#x2018;living&#x2019; parishes. What took centuries to build was destroyed by Putin and his fools in just four years. Putin is the enemy of the &#x2018;Russian world.&#x2019;&#x201D; The term &quot;Russian world&quot; promotes the idea that Russian-speaking individuals across the globe, regardless of their country of origin, are linked through cultural, linguistic, and historical bonds. While similar concepts exist within other imperial contexts, Russia&apos;s framing of the idea has assumed a distinctly militaristic character in recent years. This aggressive stance has jeopardized the sovereignty of not only Ukraine but also countries like Moldova and Georgia.

(Kirill Kudryavtsev / AFP via Getty Images)In &#x201C;Patriot,&#x201D; Navalny admitted that in the aftermath of the USSR&#x2019;s dissolution, he cared first and foremost about &#x201C;the plight of Russians,&#x201D; and criticized Putin&#x2019;s regime for preferring to &#x201C;talk endlessly about oppressed Russians (who live as minorities abroad following the dissolution of the countries that made up the USSR) while doing nothing to help them.&#x201D; He went on to advocate for the funding of Russian schools abroad to promote the spread of the Russian language and even &#x201C;resettling people back to their homeland.&#x201D; To what extent did Navalny&apos;s views on Ukraine-Russia relations evolve during his time in prison? The fact that he finally recognized Crimea as Ukraine, called for reparations to Ukraine after regime change in Russia, as well as an international investigation into Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine was promising. But would he have viewed Ukrainians&#x2019; reembrace of their language, culture, and history as a threat to the prosperity of the so-called &#x201C;Russian world&#x201D;? His condemnation of the full-scale war and concern with the economic prosperity of Russia suggest that if he had somehow defied all odds and been able to form a political movement strong enough to overthrow Putin&#x2019;s regime, our current reality could have been avoided. Yet, considering that he was worried about &#x201C;the plight of Russians&#x201D; and described both countries as &#x201C;fraternal,&#x201D; it seems that tensions between the two would have undeniably taken a different shape. Bearing all this in mind, one of the most jarring and disappointing aspects of the memoir is the use of Russian transliteration for Ukrainian locations. Kyiv is rendered as &quot;Kiev,&quot; Chornobyl as &quot;Chernobyl,&quot; and Zalissia as &quot;Zalisiye,&quot; which feels not only outdated but careless. This lapse falls on the translators, Arch Tait and Stephen Dalziel, but even more so on Alfred A. Knopf, a subsidiary of Penguin, for allowing such a glaring oversight to remain in the final publication. The potential trajectory of Navalny&#x2019;s evolving thoughts on Ukraine-Russia relations will forever remain speculative. Regardless of any valid criticism leveled against him, Navalny should not have faced imprisonment, poisoning, or death in custody. In a better world, political opposition would be allowed to flourish in Russia, fostering a healthy democratic environment. His life&#x2019;s work is proof that despite the insurmountable odds faced by those living in an authoritarian state, it is never too late to try and fight for a better future. The fact that he was able to smuggle out the end passages of this book through his lawyers and, in that sense, remain defiant of Putin to the very end, is admirable. The one-year anniversary of Navalny&#x2019;s death is approaching, and the remaining figureheads of the Russian opposition are all in exile, engaged in spats with one another, and lacking a clear strategy to take on Putin. They condemn the war, yet many still hesitate to address the question of collective guilt. The decade-long war of aggression against Ukraine stands as Russian society&#x2019;s greatest moral failure &#x2013; the more than 145,000 war crimes under investigation by Ukraine&#x2019;s Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office are proof of that. If there is to be hope for a democratic Russia, it must begin with the acknowledgment from those who will continue Navalny&#x2019;s work that Ukraine&#x2019;s military victory over Russia is the key to any democratic future for their country. However, Navalny&#x2019;s widow recently said in an interview with German media that it was &#x201C;hard to say&#x201D; whether it&#x2019;s right to arm Ukraine because &#x201C;the bombs also hit Russians.&#x201D; Many of the remaining members of the opposition cannot even move past calling it &quot;Putin&apos;s war,&quot; and the prospect of such change remains difficult to envision.

Opinion: There’s more to Ukraine than Hollywood gangster tropes and war	I recently watched a YouTube video of a Ukrainian performance on &#x201C;America&#x2019;s Got Talent.&#x201D; A friend sent me the link, promising it would amaze me &#x2013; and it did. You can find the video by searching &#x201C;Amazing holographic 4D cube show AGT.&#x201D; However, when the show&#x2019;s host, Howie Mandel, said, &#x201C;America&#x2019;s got love for the Ukraine,&#x201D; I cringed. The phrase &#x201C;the Ukraine&#x201D; implies it&#x2019;s a territory, not a sovereign country. It&#x2019;s just Ukraine &#x2013; the largest country in Europe, an important nation in its own right, and sadly, a place the world still knows too little about. Ukraine is often branded as a place of corruption and gangsters, and Hollywood doesn&#x2019;t help when it makes the villains Ukrainian. After living in Kyiv for years, I&#x2019;ve experienced something very different. The country I know is filled with talented, hardworking, and warm people who possess an incredible sense of humor. Since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, too many people think Ukraine is nothing but a war zone. I recently heard Mstyslav Chernov, the director of the Oscar-winning documentary &#x201C;20 Days in Mariupol,&#x201D; say that Americans often ask, &#x201C;Is there more to Ukraine than the war?&#x201D; I&#x2019;ve had similar frustrating conversations abroad, with people asking, &#x201C;Is that war still going on?&#x201D; Before the pandemic, I hosted many foreigners visiting Kyiv, often to explore IT opportunities. Questions like &#x201C;Is it safe there?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Do they have the internet?&#x201D; were common. Even more surprising are comments from the Ukrainian diaspora. In Canada, home to the largest Ukrainian community outside of Ukraine, some people who left decades ago have no idea how their country has advanced. &#x201C;They have shopping malls in Kyiv?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Do they have electric cars?&#x201D; Yes, Ukraine faces challenges, and many people live on modest salaries. But there is a growing middle class, and the big cities capture imaginations. Every guest I hosted in Kyiv was blown away.

(Lynsey Addario/Getty Images)People hang out at a bar in Kyiv, Ukraine, on May 26, 2023. (Roman Pilipey/Getty Images)One misconception that always made me giggle is when people ask, &#x201C;What will we eat there?&#x201D; The food scene in Kyiv is incredible. There&#x2019;s been an explosion of amazing restaurants, and dining out here can compete with New York or London any day. Even during the war, new places are opening, and the food is phenomenal. If you want to have a laugh, &#xA0;stand-up comedy clubs are popular &#x2013; even in English. Where there&#x2019;s laughter, there&#x2019;s hope. I had a friend from California visit twice, and when he returned to Los Angeles, people teased him, asking if he&#x2019;d visited the land of Borat. He said Ukrainians are just like people in California &#x2013; trying to build businesses, raise families, and live their lives. That&#x2019;s the thing: Ukraine is not some backward nation that craves war. Before the full-scale invasion, Kyiv was on track to become Europe&#x2019;s next hotspot, and I&#x2019;d have bet anything on that happening. This brutal war has set everything back. Ukraine is not about war. It&#x2019;s about modernity, freedom, and new culture. It&#x2019;s a country brimming with energy. Ukraine has suffered from a poor reputation for as long as I can remember. I first discovered Kyiv nearly 17 years ago, and I&#x2019;ve been saying ever since that Ukraine needs to work on its brand. Of course, now that we&#x2019;re in the third year of the full-scale invasion, things are different. Air raid sirens can go off at any time, and it can be scary when Ukrainian air defenses shoot down drones and missiles. During those moments, you head to the bomb shelter. But life continues. One of the biggest misconceptions about Ukraine is that everyone here is poor and miserable. Most people don&#x2019;t have easy lives, and yes, poverty exists, but that&#x2019;s true in many places. I&#x2019;m originally from South Africa, where poverty exists on a different scale. In Ukraine, no one lives in shantytowns. When millions of Ukrainians fled across the borders, the European host nations were often surprised to see modern cars, fashionable clothes, and the latest smartphones. It&#x2019;s a high-tech nation, and the level of online convenience here would surprise any foreigner. There&#x2019;s also a wave of innovation happening. Ukraine is poised to become a global leader in military drone technology. Artists are creating, entrepreneurs are developing cool tech, new restaurants are opening, and foreign investors are exploring opportunities. Ukraine is a miracle. Even as hypersonic missiles and kamikaze drones rain down across the country, many have decided to stay, continuing their lives, albeit in a very different way. The economy needs to keep running. Life needs to go on to keep the wheels turning. Many passionate, dedicated people are working on projects to benefit and support Ukraine. Some have been involved long before the full-scale invasion, driven by a deep belief in the country and its people. Since 2018, I&#x2019;ve been part of a team of artists &#x2014; Ukrainian and international &#x2014; creating a storytelling film project that captures life in modern Kyiv. &#x201C;We Are Ukraine&#x201D; is a story about extraordinary people in an extraordinary time &#x2014; people who have chosen to continue to work, live, get married, have children, and laugh, against all odds. It&#x2019;s not a war story, a story about death and demise. It&#x2019;s a story about life, a love letter to Kyiv, which shows us what the world would miss out on if Kyiv would cease to exist. Freedom, independence, and identity are the culmination of modern humanity, forged over centuries through struggle, creativity, and resilience. Everything else in civil society flows from these values. Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine is a global wake-up call &#x2013; a reminder that these values must be nurtured and protected. Ukrainians are showing that not only can they defend these values, but by continuing to live, laugh, and love, they are defying those who seek to destroy them.

Ukraine war latest: US won't impose new limitations on Ukraine's use of American weapons if North Korea enters war, Pentagon says	Key developments on Oct. 28: The United States will not introduce new restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of American weapons if North Korean troops engage in combat, the Pentagon said on Oct. 28 following NATO&apos;s confirmation of North Korean troops&apos; deployment to Kursk Oblast. &quot;A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast near the border with Ukraine,&quot; said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, Reuters reported. The U.S. said on Oct. 26 that North Korean troops are being dispatched to Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region facing a Ukrainian offensive. Some 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops on Oct. 23, according to the Pentagon. U.S. President Joe Biden described the development as &quot;a very dangerous.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said already on Oct. 24 that the first units had been deployed in Kursk Oblast. Yet, the Pentagon declined to confirm that North Korean forces were already in the area. &quot;It is likely that they are moving in that direction towards Kursk. But I don&apos;t have more details just yet,&quot; Singh said. Previously, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said that Russia is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian military has not yet fought with or captured North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, said Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk, on Oct. 28. Russia and North Korea have initially dismissed the reports but recently turned to more evasive rhetoric as evidence of the troops&apos; dispatch mounted. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from using American-made long-range weapons to strike deep into Russia. At the same time, the U.S. is planning to provide Ukraine with an aid package of $700-800 million for the domestic production of long-range capabilities, Zelensky announced on Oct. 21. Russian forces attacked downtown Kharkiv using a FAB-500 bomb on Oct. 28, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak later said that the strike damaged the Derzhprom building (the State Industry Building), which has been under enhanced UNESCO protection since 2022. Around 9 p.m. local time, a series of explosions occurred in the city. The strikes caused a fire and heavy smoke in the central part of Kharkiv. At least six people were injured, Syniehubov said at around 9:30 p.m. local time. The attack damaged a medical facility as well as administrative buildings. Information on damage and casualties is being clarified, according to Terekhov. Russia has lost 650,000 troops, including killed and wounded, in the war against Ukraine, Zelensky said in an interview with Times of India, published on Oct. 28. Over 690,000 Russian military personnel were put out of action since the beginning of its full-scale invasion in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Besides the wounded and killed, this figure also includes those who were captured. Estonian intelligence estimated that Russia could lose up to 40,000 personnel in October. &quot;Russia itself has killed a lot of Russians. A lot of mobilized Russian soldiers were killed by the Russian army itself because they were afraid to attack, to perish under the bullets, or to be wounded. So, they retreated and then were killed by their army,&quot; Zelensky told Times of India. &quot;This is their law of war,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that Russia also does not pick up its dead soldiers from the battlefield, leaving their bodies to rot on the ground. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump plans to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine by freezing it if he wins the U.S. presidential election, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 28, citing its sources close to the former president&apos;s team. Trump has claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations. Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, in September, outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside NATO, according to the FT. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would create autonomous zones in Russian occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk Agreement. The new plan will include enforcement mechanisms and consequences for violating the agreement, the adviser said. But, in his opinion, European troops, not NATO forces or UN peacekeepers, will have to keep order. &quot;There are two things America will insist on. We will not have any men or women in the enforcement mechanism. We&#x2019;re not paying for it. Europe is paying for it,&quot; he added. Trump&apos;s allies argue that Ukraine is losing the war and, therefore, pushing for a settlement is morally right. Trump believes that Biden should talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as presidents did with Soviet leaders during the Cold War, and that NATO membership is not an option for Ukraine in the short term. Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst who served in Trump&apos;s White House and is now at the America First Policy Institute Center for American Security, suggested in an interview with the FT that Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO could be taken off the agenda for several years to force Russia to the negotiating table. Almost 80% of buildings in Vovchansk have been destroyed or damaged after Russia launched its offensive against the town, showed a joint investigation by Bellingcat and AFP published on Oct. 28. The once 17,000-people town, located just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border in Kharkiv Oblast, became heavily contested following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Vovchansk endured a Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing most residents to flee their homes. Talking to journalists, the civilians recounted harrowing stories of escape, who, on occasion, deliberately targeted civilians during their attempts to flee. Some 60% of all buildings in the town were destroyed, and 18% were partially damaged, Bellingcat and AFP said, citing satellite imagery. As of late September, only 22% of the buildings remained intact. Despite Russia&#x2019;s surprise assault in May, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. Since then, the intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian tactics usually entail flattening towns and villages with artillery barrages and bombs before moving in to &quot;capture&quot; the ruined settlements. For example, no buildings were left intact in the Donetsk Oblast town of Toretsk as a result of the Russian onslaught, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 14.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-us-wont-impose-new-limitations-on-ukraines-use-of-american-weapons-if-north-korea-enters-war-pentagon-says/	2024-10-28T14:04:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Croatia to provide Ukraine with 30 tanks, 30 infantry fighting vehicles in exchange for German Leopard tanks	Croatian Defense Minister Ivan Anusic signed a memorandum with his German counterpart Boris Pistorius, under which the Croatian side will receive Leopard 2A8 tanks in exchange for the equipment it will transfer to Ukraine, according to Croatian Defense Ministry statement. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Croatia has provided Ukraine with over 300 million euros ($330 million) in assistance, including 11 defense packages. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a new 12th aid package from an allied country in early September. Croatia has committed to supplying 30 M-84 tanks and 30 M-80 infantry fighting vehicles, as well as spare parts and ammunition, in exchange for financial means to purchase up to 50 Leopard 2A8 tanks, according to the memorandum. The total price of the new Leopard 2A8s will be reduced by the amount Germany will pay Croatia for transferring its equipment to Ukraine. Anusic expressed hope that the implementation of this initiative would begin &quot;very soon.&quot; &quot;All other details will be known after the contract is signed. An additional value of this procurement model is to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression,&quot; the statement read. On Oct. 9, President Volodymyr Zelensky and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic signed a bilateral agreement on support and cooperation. This was the 27th bilateral agreement signed between Ukraine and a partner country since a joint G7 declaration during a NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/croatia-to-provide-ukraine-with-30-tanks-30-infantry-fighting-vehicles-in-exchange-for-german-leopard-tanks/	2024-10-28T13:18:37-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/Leopard-2A4.jpg
Russia strikes downtown Kharkiv with aerial glide bombs, injuring at least 6	Russian forces attacked the center of Kharkiv using aerial glide bombs on Oct. 28, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. Around 9 p.m. local time, a series of explosions occurred in the city. The strikes caused a fire and heavy smoke in the central part of Kharkiv. At least six people were injured, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said at around 9:30 p.m. local time. The attack damaged a medical facility as well as administrative buildings. Information on damage and casualties is being clarified, according to Terekhov. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city. Ukrainian officials have also warned that Moscow is once again preparing to carry out strikes against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months, causing blackouts and disruptions to essential services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-center-of-kharkiv-with-aerial-glide-bombs-injuring-at-least-5-people/	2024-10-28T13:06:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1553430606.jpeg
North Korea's current arms sales to Russia estimated at up to $5.5 billion, Friedrich Naumann Foundation suggests	North Korea is currently providing Russia with weapons worth up to $5.5 billion, according to a study by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, published on Oct. 28. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Pyongyang has significantly increased its arms supplies to its longtime ally, Moscow, fueling its aggression against Ukraine. This fall, North Korea also sent troops to participate in the war on Russia&apos;s side, as confirmed by Ukrainian military intelligence. Because North Korea and Russia do not publish official statistics on the country&apos;s bilateral trade, there is uncertainty. But even the minimum estimate of shipments is over $1.7 billion, the study reads. North Korea&apos;s revenues could increase by &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; as Pyongyang will receive money for sending soldiers. Meanwhile, the deployment of more than 20,000 North Korean soldiers seems &quot;unlikely,&quot; as it could jeopardize the stability of the North Korean regime. The risk of desertion and human resource constraints also stand in the way, according to the research. The tightening of relations between Russia and North Korea is also reflected in &quot;a notable rise&quot; in diplomatic visits. Media analysis shows that since July 2023, there have been an average of two monthly high-level meetings. In 2024, there have already been over 24 such meetings. In the past three decades, the norm was less than five meetings, the study read. &quot;Russia is turning to North Korea primarily because of its massive need for ammunition,&quot; Olena Guseinova, the study&apos;s author, said. &quot;Russia is using its relationship with North Korea &#x2013; and the potential transfer of military technology &#x2013; as a tool to test the unity of Western alliances, particularly in East Asia. Russia aims to pressure countries like South Korea and Japan into reconsidering their support for Ukraine,&quot; Guseinova added.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-koreas-current-arms-sales-to-russia-estimated-at-up-to-5-5-billion-friedrich-naumann-foundation-suggests/	2024-10-28T12:56:03-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Ukraine expands long-range drone strikes target list, alcohol now on the menu	Ukraine faces a tricky dilemma as winter approaches. &#xA0; How can it disrupt an expected mass Russian missile campaign targeting the country&apos;s infrastructure while simultaneously being barred from using Western-supplied weapons to strike deep inside Russia? Despite being limited to the use of long-range kamikaze drones, one method employed by Kyiv has scored some spectacular success in recent weeks. One of the largest explosions of the full-scale invasion saw, in the words of a Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) source, an ammunition warehouse &quot;literally wiped off the face of the earth&quot; in Tver Oblast last month. This came just days after Ukraine confirmed attacks on two other arms depots, with the U.K. Defense Ministry saying the combined strikes caused &quot;the largest loss of ammunition&quot; in Russia during its all-out war against Ukraine. While the destruction of Russia&apos;s cruise and ballistic missiles by Ukrainian drones seems an obvious target for Kyiv&apos;s military planners, more recent strikes show the campaign is far broader. It now includes ethanol distilleries producing industrial alcohol. &quot;Russian military aviation cannot function without alcohol,&quot; Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, said in a post on social media. &#xA0; His comments on Oct. 28 followed reports of a strike on an ethanol plant in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast the evening before. Kovalenko wasn&apos;t referring to the drinking habits of Russian pilots, but to the ethanol used in the manufacture of a wide range of both everyday items such as mouthwash and paint, to military-grade products needed to keep an air force flying. &quot;From fuel to braking systems, from liquids for technical needs, cleaning, to anti-icing agents. It&apos;s all alcohol,&quot; Kovalenko said. AQ 400 Scythe kamikaze drones in an undisclosed location in Dec. 2023. (Terminal Autonomy)Targeting the bottlenecksAs well as the strikes on ammunition depots, Ukraine has continued to target Russian factories, most recently the Kremniy El microelectronics plant in the Russian city of Bryansk overnight on Oct. 19. &quot;When you target an adversaries capabilities, there are always two ways of doing it &#x2014; you either target the capabilities themselves, like the missile storage sites, the aircraft that carry them, etc, or you can target production,&quot; Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. According to reports, the Kremniy El plant produced, among other things, components for Russia&apos;s Iskander ballistic missile, making the factory a perfect target for Ukraine, Hinz said. &quot;The smart way of doing things is&#x2026; to target the bottlenecks,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;And if you&apos;re very lucky, that bottleneck might not only be very narrow but may also not be as well-defended as other parts of the production process.&quot; And with the recent strikes targeting ethanol production, it appears Ukraine is attempting to target a potential bottleneck in Russian aviation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s concerted campaign to get permission to use Western-supplied weapons like the U.S-made ATACMs and the U.K&apos;s Storm Shadows to strike deep inside Russia has, to date, failed. Kyiv specifically hoped to be able to use the weapons to strike Russian airbases, destroying aircraft like the Tu-22 bomber that launch missiles against Ukrainian cities. Compounding the problem, while the international debate dragged its heels, the White House last month confirmed that Russia had moved 90% of its aircraft out of range of long-range missiles like the US-made ATACMS. While Russian airbases are still within range of Ukraine&apos;s long-range drones, they&apos;re far less effective against well-defended targets than ATACMs or Storm Shadows. &quot;One-way attack UAV usually have quite a small warhead so it&apos;s not the same as a ballistic or cruise missile,&quot; Hinz said. However, drones can potentially have an outsized impact when they hit highly flammable and less protected targets, such as ethanol distilleries. AQ 400 Scythe kamikaze drones. (Terminal Autonomy)The first recent reported Ukrainian strikes on Russian ethanol plants were overnight on Oct. 22, when a drone reportedly set fire to the Biokhim distillery in the town of Rasskazovo. Videos posted to social media by panicking locals showed a huge fire at the scene of the strike. According to the Biokhim website, the plant produces &quot;products of strategic importance for the state,&quot; in particular ethanol. Two more distilleries came under the attack in the settlements of Efremov and Luzhkovsky in Tula Oblast on the same night. And more recently, Russian media reported that Ukranian drone strikes on the evening of Oct. 27 targeted distilleries in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast. &quot;Strikes on distilleries are strikes on Russian aircraft in order to reduce their capabilities,&quot; Kovalenko said. But an expert who spoke to the Kyiv Independent suggested Ukraine&apos;s tactic of targeting ethanol plants is unlikely to have a serious impact on Russian military aviation. &quot;While it sounds superficially plausible, it will be hard for such strikes to have a lasting impact, even in winter,&quot; Peter Layton, former Australian Air Force officer, Associate Fellow at RUSI, and Visiting Fellow at Griffith Asia Institute, told the Kyiv Independent. Layton pointed out that ethanol is &quot;widely available globally,&quot; and even if all of Russia&apos;s production was taken out, a friendly country like China could resupply it quickly. &quot;New stocks can be quickly bought on the world market,&quot; he said. &quot;Moreover, Russian ethanol plants are likely to only be out of service for a short time until they are repaired. &quot;It sounds like a critical vulnerability but is unlikely to prove so.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-expands-its-long-range-drone-strikes-target-list-alcohol-now-on-the-menu/	2024-10-28T12:11:57-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2087314148-1.jpg
US won't impose new restrictions on Ukraine's use of American weapons if North Korea joins war, Pentagon says	The United States will not introduce new restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of American weapons if North Korean troops engage in combat, the Pentagon said Oct. 28. following NATO&apos;s confirmation of North Korean troops&apos; deployment to Kursk Oblast. &quot;A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast near the border with Ukraine,&quot; said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, as Reuters reported. The U.S. said on Oct. 26 that North Korean troops are being dispatched to Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region facing a Ukrainian offensive. Some 10,000 North Korean troops had been deployed to eastern Russia for training, up from an estimate of 3,000 troops on Oct. 23, according to the Pentagon. U.S. President Joe Biden described the development as &quot;a very dangerous.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said already on Oct. 24 that the first units had been deployed in Kursk Oblast. Yet, the Pentagon declined to confirm that North Korean forces were already in the area. &quot;It is likely that they are moving in that direction towards Kursk. But I don&apos;t have more details just yet,&quot; Singh said.Previously, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said that Russia is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia and North Korea have initially dismissed the reports but recently turned to more evasive rhetoric as evidence of the troops&apos; dispatch mounted. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from using American-made long-range weapons to strike deep into Russia. At the same time, the U.S. is planning to provide Ukraine with an aid package of $700-800 million for the domestic production of long-range capabilities, Zelensky announced on Oct. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-wont-impose-new-restrictions-on-ukraines-use-of-american-weapons-if-north-korea-joins-war-pentagon-says/	2024-10-28T11:17:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1459767214.jpg
Ukrainian forces have not yet engaged in combat with North Korean soldiers, military says	The Ukrainian military has not yet fought with or captured North Korean soldiers in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, said Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s Operational Tactical Group Siversk, on Pershyi TV channel on Oct. 28. The first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone on Oct. 27 or 28, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Asked whether North Korean troops have been spotted on the battlefield, Mysnyk said that intelligence data confirms that the Russian command is redeploying North Korean troops closer to the front in Kursk Oblast. Yet Ukrainian forces have not yet encountered them. The U.S. said on Oct. 26 that North Korean troops are being dispatched to Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region facing a Ukrainian offensive. While the White House did specify in what capacity they would be deployed, Ukraine and South Korea said that at least some North Korean troops would be used in combat. Previously, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said that Russia is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals.

Georgians take streets in protest as pro-Russian party crowned election winner amid wide-scale fraud	Georgia has descended into political turmoil that is set to shape the country for years to come. Although exit polls indicated that the pro-European opposition coalition would win the Oct. 26 parliament elections, the official results paint a different picture. The Central Election Commission announced on the evening of Oct. 27 that the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party had won 54.08% of the vote, while a coalition of four pro-European opposition parties had won only 37.58%. International observers, opposition politicians, and the country&apos;s president all cried foul, alleging widespread electoral fraud. Thousands of Georgians were taking the streets of downtown Tbilisi in protest. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili was one of them. A day prior, Zourabichvili urged citizens to join her at Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Rustaveli Avenue to protest the falsified election.

(Photo by Mirian Meladze/Anadolu via Getty Images)&quot;These elections cannot be recognized. This is the same as recognizing Georgia&apos;s subordination to Russia. ... No one can take away Georgia&apos;s European future,&quot; she said. The ruling Georgian Dream party campaigned as the &quot;party of peace,&quot; highlighting the devastation of Ukrainian cities caused by the invading Russian forces as something that they could avoid by cozying up to Moscow. The ruling party also placed emphasis that electing the pro-European opposition is a potential route to war with Russia. The Georgian Dream campaign posters underline this rhetoric with slogans such as: &quot;With the Georgian Dream, say yes to peace, no to war.&quot; But it wasn&apos;t the brutal campaigning that delivered the favorable result for the ruling party, according to observers, it was the widespread fraud. Observers documented a range of violations, from the distribution of pre-filled ballots to the confiscation of personal identification cards. &quot;We&apos;ve witnessed ballots already marked in favor of the ruling party or voters being handed multiple ballots,&quot; a lawyer of We Vote told the Kyiv Independent from its headquarters on Liberty Square. The NGO also pointed out that criminal groups linked to the ruling party intimidated voters and observers throughout the day. During a press conference that followed the election, Iulian Bulai, a representative from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), said that &quot;free and fair elections were not assured.&quot; Following the remarks, Bulai promptly exited without answering questions. Oleksiy Honcharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker part of the PACE monitoring group, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;it&apos;s clear that Russia wants to have Georgia in its orbit.&quot; &quot;As always, they&apos;re using democratic procedures to make anti-democratic things. And that&apos;s what they&apos;re doing again here,&quot; Honcharenko said. &quot;What I personally saw in the rural area is very, very disturbing. It clearly influences the results of elections, so they can&apos;t be called fair and free,&quot; he added. A source close to U.S. intelligence services told Bloomberg that Georgian Dream&apos;s electronic infrastructure may have been compromised: &quot;The Russians appear to have taken possession of key servers,&quot; the unnamed source said. Georgia&apos;s opposition has drawn parallels between the current situation and Ukraine&apos;s ongoing conflict with Russia. &quot;We&apos;re fighting the same enemy,&quot; said opposition activist Marika Mikiashvili. &quot;The future of Georgia, free from Russian influence, is at stake.&quot; Ana Minadze, an activist with the NGO Free Georgia, was one of those who were planning to pretest. &quot;For me, the motivation is simple: Georgia will never become Russia,&quot; she said. Her sentiment echoes the sentiment of young activists who have grown up watching Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression and who reject any rapprochement with Moscow despite Georgian Dream&apos;s messaging. &quot;Our government is catering to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&apos;s interests,&quot; Minadze states. &quot;We&apos;ve lost 20 percent of our land to Russia, and yet Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgian Dream&apos;s oligarch leader, wants us to apologize to those who invaded us in 2008. That&apos;s something I&apos;ll never accept.&quot; Minadze believes Georgia&apos;s future lies within Europe, not Moscow&apos;s sphere. &quot;We&apos;ve been to Europe, we&apos;ve been to America; we know what Western life is like, and we know what Russia&apos;s like,&quot; she explained, emphasizing the divide she feels between freedom and repression. &quot;Education, economy, and everyday life &#x2014; we see what&apos;s at stake, and that&apos;s why we will protest.&quot; Meanwhile, Pro-Russian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that the Georgian parliament will approve the government despite protests by the opposition. The stand off had thus begun.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgians-take-streets-in-protest-as-pro-russian-party-crowned-election-winner-amid-wide-scale-fraud/	2024-10-28T10:36:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180886090.jpg
650,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in war against Ukraine, Zelensky says	Russia has lost 650,000 troops, including killed and wounded, in the war against Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Times of India, published on Oct. 28. Over 690,000 Russian military personnel were put out of action since the beginning of its full-scale invasion in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, according to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Besides the wounded and killed, this figure also includes those who were captured. Estonian intelligence estimated that Russia could lose up to 40,000 personnel in October. &quot;Russia itself has killed a lot of Russians. A lot of mobilized Russian soldiers were killed by the Russian army itself because they were afraid to attack, to perish under the bullets, or to be wounded. So, they retreated and then were killed by their army,&quot; Zelensky told Times of India. &quot;This is their law of war,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that Russia also does not pickup its dead soldiers from the battlefield, leaving their bodies to rot on the ground. Speaking about the situation at the front, the president said that in eastern Ukraine, the Russian army is advancing by employing human attack waves, &quot;throwing its soldiers into a meat grinder.&quot; In recent months, Russian troops have been conducting a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, making territorial gains while incurring heavy losses. Russian troops set their sights on Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar, among other targets, with the latter located on a higher ground, after capturing Avdiivka in February. The higher ground could give Russian troops a key strategic advantage in attacks on other towns in Donetsk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/650-000-russian-soldiers-have-been-killed-or-wounded-in-war-against-ukraine-zelensky-says/	2024-10-28T09:56:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177266193.jpg
Anti-money laundering watchdog refuses to blacklist Russia as Moscow cozies up to Iran, North Korea	After days of discussions, the world&#x2019;s leading anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), opted last week not to blacklist Russia despite efforts from Kyiv to sway members to do so over the Kremlin&#x2019;s increasingly closer ties with blacklisted North Korea and Iran. The FATF, which monitors illicit financial activity like money laundering and terrorist financing, suspended Russia&#x2019;s membership in February 2023 due to Moscow&#x2019;s conduct with blacklisted states and cyber crimes. The international organization met in Paris from Oct. 22 to 25 to discuss which countries should be moved from its gray and blacklists. But while the FATF upheld Moscow&#x2019;s suspension, it failed to take the punishment a step forward by branding Russia a &#x201C;high-risk country,&#x201D; marking another victory for Russia against a Western-led sanctions regime that has looked to ostracize it in the world. The FATF said it condemns Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the organization requires a full consensus from its 40 members to move Russia to its no-go list. Some countries, like South Africa and Brazil, have approached Russia more amicably than their Western counterparts. Ukraine, which is not a member, has tried to encourage the FATF to brand Russia as a high-risk country, but to no avail. In the leadup to the Paris plenary, Kyiv presented a dossier to the FATF that evidenced Moscow&#x2019;s increasingly close-knit relations with North Korea and Iran- both blacklisted states. &#x201C;Russia is threatening the security and integrity of the global economy by allowing sanctioned states like North Korea and Iran a back door to enter and destabilize the international financial system,&#x201D; the Finance Ministry said in a press release before the meetings. Ukraine&#x2019;s dossier also mentioned Russia&#x2019;s funding of the Kremlin-financed mercenary force the Wagner Group, the role of cryptocurrencies in financing Russian terrorism, and money laundering from stolen Ukrainian goods like grain and minerals, Politico reported.

(Maxim Shemetov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)Blacklisting Russia would have sent a strong symbolic message about the international community&#x2019;s support for Ukraine, Tom Keatinge, director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a London-based research group, told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;In practical terms, it would also force the financial system (both banks and their regulators) of countries that remain bafflingly indifferent to the Kremlin&apos;s murderous activity to pay attention to the transactions they are handling,&#x201D; he added. Russia is breaching the UN&#x2019;s sanctions and FATF&#x2019;s standards by blatantly working with North Korea, Keatinge said. Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with missiles and, more recently, troops to bolster its war on Ukraine in exchange for oil, the Finance Ministry said. The Finance Ministry also highlighted Russia&#x2019;s procurement of ballistic missiles from Iran and the two enemy nations&#x2019; close banking and financial cooperation. Days before the meeting, the ministry stressed the importance of acting decisively and looked to the FATF to lead the charge. &#x201C;Failing to challenge Russia&#x2019;s defiance would weaken the foundations and future stability of the global financial system,&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko said on Oct. 17. Keatinge said it is not clear why the FATF has not penalized Russia more harshly, but he noted that the multinational organization is &#x201C;fractured&#x201D; when it comes to geopolitics. He suggests that if the FATF is unwilling to take serious action, then it&#x2019;s down to the U.S., EU, and Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to press harder with sanctions.

Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images)&#x201C;It&#x2019;s time to take the gloves off,&#x201D; he said. As Russia gets more desperate in its war, with limited battlefield successes and an economic squeeze, the greater the threat Moscow poses to the global economy, the Finance Ministry warned. The FATF told its members to stay vigilant about emerging risks and the Finance Ministry said it will work with individual governments to counter Russia&#x2019;s financial crimes. Russia continues to work with cybercriminal gangs, like the Russia-based Evil Corp, to target global economies, including those of several FATF member states, the ministry claims. The U.S. recently sanctioned members of Evil Corp, claiming that the group developed and distributed the Dridex malware. Over 40 countries and hundreds of banks were impacted by the malware, causing $100 million in theft losses and damage. Timothy Ash, a senior emerging market (EM) sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, stressed that tightening sanctions would weaken Russia&#x2019;s economy, restricting its ability to wage war on Ukraine and give Ukraine and the West leverage in future negotiations. But the FATF&#x2019;s decision to not blacklist Russia has instead again unearthed the lack of leadership among the West when it comes to curtailing Russia, he told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;This should have been a slam dunk,&#x201D; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/anti-money-laundering-watchdog-refuses-to-blacklist-russia-despite-moscows-cozying-up-to-north-korea-iran/	2024-10-28T09:10:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179397996.jpg
Trump plans to end Russia's war in Ukraine by freezing it if he wins presidential election, FT reports	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump plans to end the Russian war in Ukraine by freezing it if he wins the U.S. presidential election, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 28, citing its sources close to the former president&apos;s team. Trump has claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations. Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, in September, outlined the idea of freezing the war by establishing autonomous regions on both sides of the demilitarized zone and leaving Ukraine outside NATO, according to the FT. According to one of Trump&apos;s longtime advisors, the new plan would rethink the failed Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which were never implemented. The agreements contained a plan that would autonomous zones in Russian occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Occupied Crimea was not mentioned in the Minsk Agreement. The new plan will include enforcement mechanisms and consequences for violating the agreement, the adviser said. But, in his opinion, European troops, not NATO forces or UN peacekeepers, will have to keep order. &quot;There are two things America will insist on. We will not have any men or women in the enforcement mechanism. We&#x2019;re not paying for it. Europe is paying for it,&quot; he added. Trump&apos;s allies argue that Ukraine is losing the war and, therefore, pushing for a settlement is morally right. Trump believes that Biden should talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as presidents did with Soviet leaders during the Cold War, and that NATO membership is not an option for Ukraine in the short term. Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst who served in Trump&apos;s White House and is now at the America First Policy Institute Center for American Security, suggested in an interview with the FT that Ukraine&apos;s membership in NATO could be taken off the agenda for several years to force Russia to the negotiating table. &quot;We freeze the conflict, Ukraine does not cede any territory, they don&apos;t give up their territorial claims, and we have negotiations with the understanding there probably won&apos;t be a final agreement until Putin leaves the stage,&quot; Fleitz said. This approach, though, will not have unanimous support within the Republican Party, the FT reported, citing the European Council on Foreign Relations. Mike Waltz, one of the foremost Republican speakers on national security in the House of Representatives, suggested that Trump could threaten to collapse the Russian economy by lowering oil and gas prices to bring Putin to the negotiating table. &quot;You flood the world with cheaper, cleaner American oil and gas. You drive down the price,&quot; Waltz added. Saudi Arabia, an important ally of Trump&apos;s during his first term, would not welcome such a move. Yet people close to Trump insist he will put economic solid pressure on Putin. &quot;He (Trump) has shown he knows how to bring both sides to the table,&quot; said Ric Grenell, who was an outspoken ambassador to Berlin and a Balkans envoy in Trump&apos;s first term, recalling the Abraham Accords, the agreements signed between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan, when Trump was in office. &quot;He&apos;s done it consistently. Arabs and Israelis, Russians and Ukrainians will be next.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-plans-to-end-russias-war-in-ukraine-by-freezing-it-if-he-wins-presidential-election-ft-reports/	2024-10-28T09:06:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg
Ukraine sabotages railway bridge in occupied Berdiansk, intelligence source claims	Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) and the Ukrainian resistance sabotaged a railway bridge in the occupied city of Berdiansk, a HUR source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 28. The bridge between the Vodokanal utility company building and a car wash at Skhidnyi Avenue was blown up after several explosions overnight, according to the source. The port city of Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast has been occupied by Russia since early 2022. The city lies at the Azov Sea and serves as a key transport hub for occupying authorities, namely to ship out looted grain and other resources from occupied Ukraine. A military intelligence source told Ukrinform that the bridge&apos;s destruction paralyzed Russia&apos;s railway connection with Berdiansk. This allegedly prevents Moscow from supplying fuel, arms, and ammunition to its forces in the occupied city via railway. Older satellite imagery of the railway bridge allegedly targeted by HUR and the Ukrainian resistance in Russian-occupied Berdiansk, Ukraine, on Oct. 28, 2024. (Google Maps)Explosions at the bridge were also reported by the exiled local authorities on Telegram. &quot;According to preliminary information, the railway bridge between the Vodokanal building and the car wash on Skhidnyi Avenue was blown up,&quot; the exiled Berdiansk city military administration said. The Russian state media dismissed the reports as a &quot;blatant disinformation campaign,&quot; connecting the blasts to exercises of Russian forces in the city and claiming that all bridges in Berdiansk stand intact. Ukrinform&apos;s source refuted claims by the Russian media, citing a lack of visual evidence. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims, as neither Ukraine nor Russia provided footage of the bridge after the supposed explosions.	https://kyivindependent.com/berdiansk-bridge/	2024-10-28T07:21:51-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1242319542.jpg
Finnish court orders seizing Russian assets at request of Ukraine's Naftogaz company	A Finnish court in Helsinki ruled in favor of Ukraine&#x2019;s state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz and ordered the seizure of Russia&apos;s assets in Finland worth tens of millions of dollars, the company&#x2019;s statement read on Oct. 28. According to a ruling in 2023 by the Permanent Arbitration Court based in The Hague, Russia is obliged to pay $5 billion to Naftogaz Group as compensation for assets illegally seized during the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. &quot;Since Russia refuses to voluntarily pay Naftogaz the funds stipulated by The Hague decision, we continue to use all available mechanisms to collect them. Today, we are one step closer to restoring justice,&quot; Oleksii Chernyshov, head of the Naftogaz Group, said in the statement. The Finnish court ordered the seizure of &quot;real estate and other assets,&quot; Naftogaz said without providing further details. According to the company, Russia violated the agreement between the two countries on protecting each other&#x2019;s investments when it illegally annexed Crimea and expropriated strategically important energy investments of Naftogaz. Today&apos;s ruling marks the first instance of enforcing this decision in a third-country&#x2019;s court, the statement read. Interest on the rest of Russia&#x2019;s obligations to pay will continue to accrue until the full payment of the arbitration, the company noted.	https://kyivindependent.com/finnish-court-orders-seizing-russian-assets-at-request-of-ukraines-naftogaz/	2024-10-28T07:02:40-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1231980097.jpg
Zelensky arrives in Iceland for 4th Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Iceland on Oct. 28 to attend the fourth Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit and meet with Nordic leaders. This is Zelensky&apos;s first official visit to the island country, during which he will meet the prime ministers of Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. &quot;The Nordic countries are our principled and resolute allies, and the Ukraine-Nordic Platform stands as one of our most productive multilateral formats,&quot; Zelensky said on X. According to the president, the talks will focus on international support for Ukraine&apos;s five-step victory plan and on &quot;financing Ukrainian weapons production and long-range capabilities, winterization efforts, maritime security, restriction on Russia&#x2019;s shadow fleet, enhancing defense assistance, providing training and equipment for Ukrainian forces.&quot; The Ukrainian president will also meet Iceland&apos;s parliamentary leaders and attend the session of the Nordic Council, an inter-parliamentary cooperation group of the Nordic countries. Zelensky previously attended the third Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit held in Stockholm in May.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-arrives-in-iceland/	2024-10-28T06:43:21-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177157663.jpg
Almost 80% of Vovchansk's buildings destroyed, damaged in Russian attacks, analysis says	Almost 80% of buildings in Vovchansk have been destroyed or damaged after Russia launched its offensive against the town, a joint investigation by Bellingcat and AFP published on Oct. 28 showed. The once 17,000-strong town, located just 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the Russian border in Kharkiv Oblast, became heavily contested following Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Vovchansk endured a Russian occupation until the 2022 autumn Ukrainian counter-offensive liberated the town, only to face heavy fighting again after Russia began a new push in May 2024, forcing many residents to flee their homes. Talking to journalists, the civilians recounted harrowing stories of escape from Russian occupiers, who, on occasion, deliberately targeted civilians during their attempts to flee. According to the report, a library, a school, and a church were among the many destroyed buildings. Some 60% of all buildings in the town were destroyed, and 18% were partially damaged, Bellingcat and AFP said, citing satellite imagery. As of late September, only 22% of the buildings remained intact. Despite Russia&#x2019;s surprise assault in May, the Russian offensive in northern Kharkiv Oblast has quickly bogged down, with Russian troops reportedly suffering heavy losses. Since then, the intensity of fighting has decreased somewhat compared to other sectors in Ukraine&apos;s east near Pokrovsk, Vuhledar, and Toretsk. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian tactics usually entail flattening towns and villages with artillery barrages and bombs before moving in to &quot;capture&quot; the ruined settlements. For example, no buildings were left intact in the Donetsk Oblast town of Toretsk as a result of the Russian onslaught, Anastasia Bobovnikova, a spokesperson of the Operational Tactical Group Luhansk, said on Oct. 14.	https://kyivindependent.com/almost-80-of-vovchansks-buildings-destroyed-damaged-in-russian-attacks/	2024-10-28T06:17:28-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152881526.jpg
NATO chief confirms North Korean troops deployed in Russia's Kursk Oblast	North Korea has sent troops to Russia, and they have already been deployed in Kursk Oblast, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Oct. 28 after meeting South Korean defense and intelligence officials. Rutte joined other Western leaders in confirming reports by Kyiv and Seoul that Pyongyang is sending military personnel to Russia as a sign of deepening cooperation between the two countries. &quot;Today, I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, and that North Korean military units have been deployed to the Kursk region,&quot; the NATO secretary general said in Brussels. This comes as the secretary general&apos;s first official confirmation of North Korean troops arriving in Russia. The South Korean delegation also briefed the North Atlantic Council and representatives from Japan, Australia, and New Zealand on the North Korean involvement in Russia&apos;s war. The U.S. said on Oct. 26 that North Korean troops are being dispatched to Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region facing a Ukrainian cross-border offensive. While the White House did specify in what capacity they would be deployed, Ukraine and South Korea said that at least some North Korean troops would be used in combat. Rutte commented that the deployment represents &quot;a significant escalation in (North Korea&apos;s) ongoing involvement in Russia&apos;s illegal war&quot; and a &quot;dangerous expansion of Russia&apos;s war.&quot; Previously, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said that Russia is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including 500 officers and three generals. The spy agency said already on Oct. 24 that the first units had been deployed in Kursk Oblast, a claim at the time unconfirmed by Western officials. Russia and North Korea have initially dismissed the reports but recently turned to more evasive rhetoric as evidence of the troops&apos; dispatch mounted. &quot;The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security. It undermines peace on the Korean Peninsula and fuels the Russian war against Ukraine,&quot; Rutte said. &quot;North Korean troops are already in the Kursk region. This is exactly as we discussed, and as South Korea confirmed. Now, our allies and NATO can see it,&quot; Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, said on social media. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the first North Korean troops were to be deployed in the combat zone between Oct. 27 and 28. &quot;(Russia is) increasingly engaging North Korea as an ally, and any day now, their soldiers may appear on the battlefield fighting against Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine will be forced to actually fight against North Korea in Europe.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-chief-confirms-north-korean-troops-are-in-russias-kursk-oblast/	2024-10-28T05:08:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Rutte.jpeg
Harris likely to struggle with pushing Ukraine aid through Congress if elected, Bloomberg reports	The U.S. might eventually scale down support for Ukraine even if Democratic candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidential election, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 27, citing undisclosed Western official sources. Even if Harris sits in the White House, her administration will probably struggle to pass significant resources for Ukraine through U.S. Congress, the outlet wrote. The vice president will face Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 in an election often described as pivotal for Washinton&apos;s future support for Ukraine. While Harris is largely expected to continue the Kyiv-friendly policy of President Joe Biden, there are fears that Trump would seek to cut a deal with the Kremlin to achieve a faster resolution, even at the cost of painful concessions by Ukraine. Ukraine, which continues to face heavy onslaught by Russian forces in the country&apos;s east, can likely expect a decrease in U.S. assistance in any case as the fatigue in the West grows, according to Bloomberg. The Republican-led House of Representatives, the legislature&apos;s lower chamber, resisted the adoption of a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine for many months, directly contributing to Ukraine&apos;s setbacks on the battlefield. During the lull in U.S. assistance, Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from the stronghold of Avdiivka in February under the barrage of Russian bombs and artillery shells, underscoring the key role of Washington&apos;s support. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has repeatedly derailed the vote on the bill before finally introducing it in April, recently said he has no &quot;appetite for further Ukraine funding&quot; and hopes that a November electoral victory for Trump will bring a swift end to the war. Washington has allocated some $175 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022. This included $64 billion in military aid, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Facing Russian advances and the weakening support from partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky has pitched a five-step victory plan for ending the war by 2025. The proposal includes additional defense assistance, an immediate invitation to join NATO, and the lifting of restrictions on long-range strikes against Russia, among other steps.	https://kyivindependent.com/harris-aid-ukraine/	2024-10-28T04:45:49-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173768130.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 38 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least five people and injured at least 38 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Oct. 28. At least 21 people were injured overnight, including five children, as Russia launched multiple air attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, the State Emergency Service reported. The attack damaged a high-rise building and destroyed at least three apartments in the city of Kharkiv, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Ukrainian air defenses shot 66 Russian attack drones and 24 of them were lost across various regions, the Air Force said. In Kherson Oblast, Russian strikes killed five people and injured 13, with one child among the injured. Russian forces targeted critical infrastructure facilities, a medical facility, and residential areas in the region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on his Telegram channel. A woman and two men were injured as a result of Russian attacks in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Governor Ivan Fedorov said that at least seven buildings were damaged during the strikes. In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured and more than 50 building were damaged as a result of Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-5-injure-38-over-past-day/	2024-10-28T04:11:44-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kharkiv-Oct-28.jpg
Ex-North Korean soldiers seek Ukraine deployment to influence former comrades, media reports	A group of almost 200 ex-North Korean soldiers asked to be deployed in Ukraine to help demoralize and influence Pyongyang&apos;s troops joining the war on Russia&apos;s side, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Oct. 28. Kyiv, Seoul, and the Western countries accused North Korea of sending thousands of troops to aid Russia&apos;s ongoing war against Ukraine. According to Ukraine, Moscow is preparing to deploy 12,000 North Korean soldiers as a boost to its war effort. The first batch should reportedly be deployed in Kursk Oblast, a Russian border region partially held by Ukrainian forces. In response to the reports, a group of North Korean defectors living in South Korea offered their experience with the North Korean military to help wage psychological warfare against Moscow&apos;s allies, the South China Morning Post writes. &quot;North Korean soldiers are there essentially as mercenaries, but we would go as volunteers with a goodwill mission,&quot; said Lee Min-bok, one of the initiative&apos;s key figures who posted an appeal for deployment to the Ukrainian Embassy in Seoul. &quot;Simply our presence in Ukraine could significantly impact the morale of North Korean troops,&quot; Lee noted, saying that North Korean troops are treated as &quot;cannon fodder.&quot; &quot;North Korean soldiers could find hope and courage in our presence in Ukraine, inspiring them to cross over in search of freedom.&quot; Russia has employed the tactics of mass infantry attacks in Ukraine, overwhelming Ukrainian defenders at the cost of extremely high casualty rates. Seeking to avoid a full mobilization, the Kremlin has sought fresh manpower among convicts, migrant workers, and, most recently, North Korean allies. &quot;We are all military veterans who understand North Korea&#x2019;s military culture and psychological state better than anyone else,&quot; said Ahn Chan-il, another member of the initiative who leads the World Institute for North Korea Studies. &quot;We&#x2019;re ready to go wherever needed to work as psychological warfare agents &#x2013; through loudspeaker broadcasts, distributing leaflets, and even acting as interpreters.&quot; The Kyiv Independent has reached out to the Ukrainain Embassy in Seoul for comment but has not immediately received a response. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Oct. 24 indirectly acknowledged the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia, responding to claims of satellite imagery with &quot;if there are images, they reflect something&quot; and citing Pyongyang&apos;s defense treaty with Moscow. North Korea&apos;s Foreign Ministry said on Oct. 25 that any decision to send troops to Russia would comply with international law but did not explicitly confirm the reports. On Oct. 24, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that the country could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities.&quot; South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Tensions between Pyongyang and Seoul have been rising parallel to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. Recently, the North Korean government declared South Korea a hostile state and blew up two major roads connecting it to the southern part of the peninsula.	https://kyivindependent.com/ex-north-korean-soldiers-seek-deployment-in-ukraine/	2024-10-28T03:07:46-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg
That's what they do' — Trump's running mate Vance brushes off Russian election interference	Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance dismissed calls for stepping against Russia&#x2019;s latest attempt to meddle in the U.S. elections in an interview with CBS News on Oct. 27. U.S. intelligence warned that Russia is using disinformation to undermine the Democratic ticket of Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ahead of the presidential election Nov. 5. Vance, who is the running mate of Republican nominee and ex-President Donald Trump, has previously criticized aid for Kyiv and said he &quot;doesn&apos;t really care what happens to Ukraine.&quot; &quot;I think a lot of countries are going to try to manipulate our voters. They&apos;re going to try to manipulate our elections. That&apos;s what they do,&quot; J.D. Vance told CBS News. A fake video began circulating on the internet that showed votes for Trump being torn up by a man in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, posted by an anonymous X account with a history of spreading Russian disinformation. &quot;I can call them (Moscow) to knock it off, but this is not a schoolyard,&quot; Vance said. U.S. officials later confirmed that Russia was behind the fake video, attempting to undermine confidence in the upcoming election. Vance also criticized sanctions imposed on Russia, saying, &quot;They&apos;ve gone off like a wet firecracker.&quot; In another interview the same day, Vance called Russian President Vladimir Putin a &quot;competitor&quot; or &quot;adversary&quot; to the U.S. rather than an enemy and went on to say that negotiations with Moscow are &quot;a necessary part&quot; of ending the war in Ukraine.&#x200C;&#x200C; Vance&apos;s comments come just over one week before the U.S. presidential election, which carries high stakes for the future of American military support to Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/vance-russian-election-interference/	2024-10-28T02:00:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153568546.jpg
Sandu's rival claims support for Ukraine, Moldovan president calls him 'Moscow's man'	Moldovan presidential candidate Alexandr Stoianoglo claimed he would continue supporting Ukraine, a statement dismissed by incumbent President Maia Sandu during a presidential debate on Oct. 27. Stoianoglo, supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, will face pro-EU Sandu in a run-off presidential vote on Nov. 3. Stoianoglo and Sandu won 25.95% and 42.49% in the first round on Oct. 20, respectively. When Sandu asked how he would develop relations with Ukraine, Stoianoglo said that he would &quot;establish good relations with all development partners.&quot; &quot;We support Ukraine in the war, we provide them with humanitarian aid, and I am confident that our relations will only grow stronger during my presidency,&quot; the presidential candidate said, adding, &quot;Now, there are only militaristic statements.&quot; &quot;Do you believe what you are saying? In Kyiv, they know you&apos;re Moscow&apos;s man,&quot; Sandu retorted. According to the incumbent president, Stoianoglo is backed by Igor Dodon, Moldova&apos;s pro-Russian head of state between 2016 and 2020 who is facing corruption and treason charges. Moldovan authorities accused Moscow and pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor of buying votes to influence the elections against Sandu and against the parallel referendum on EU membership. The non-binding referendum on enshrining Chisinau&apos;s EU aspirations in the constitution passed with a razor-thin margin of 50.35%, a significantly lower result than expected. Sandu has supported Ukraine throughout the full-scale war and took her country on a clearly pro-EU path, launching accession talks earlier this year. Stoianoglo, Moldova&apos;s former prosecutor general hailing from the largely pro-Russian region of Gagauzia, presented himself as a fresh candidate who could unify the opposition. Sandu and some observers said that his candidacy was merely Moscow&apos;s ploy to put forward a more acceptable candidate than Dodon.	https://kyivindependent.com/sandus-rival-claims-support-for-ukraine-moldovan-president-calls-him-moscows-man/	2024-10-28T01:36:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178415794.jpg
Adnan Kivan, owner of Kyiv Post, dies at 61	Businessman Adnan Kivan, owner of the KADORR Group and the English-language Ukrainian news outlet Kyiv Post, has passed away, the KADORR Group announced on Oct. 28. In a statement on Facebook, the company lauded Kivan&apos;s &quot;successful business projects, social initiatives, as well as charity and patronage&quot; and extended condolences to his wife, children, and grandchildren. Kivan, an Odesa-based millionaire and investor of Syrian origin, would have turned 62 in December. The statement did not specify the cause of death. The businessman, whose activities were focused on construction and agriculture, was also involved in the media sector. He purchased the Kyiv Post in 2018 from British-Ukrainian businessman Mohammad Zahoor. Conflicts over editorial independence with the newsroom led to Kivan suspending the Kyiv Post and firing the staff in November 2021. The Kyiv Post&apos;s former editorial team subsequently founded the Kyiv Independent.	https://kyivindependent.com/kivan/	2024-10-28T01:31:45-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kivan.png
US, EU call for investigation of Georgian elections after reports of intimidation, irregularities	The EU&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged an investigation of the Georgian parliamentary elections over reports of irregularities in statements made on Oct. 27. The Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party won almost 54% of the vote in the Oct. 26 elections, but international observers declared the results neither free nor fair. Pro-EU opposition parties have disputed the ruling party&apos;s victory, and President Salome Zourabichvili said on Oct. 27 that she would not recognize the results and called for mass protests. &quot;We call on the Central Election Commission of Georgia and other relevant authorities to fulfill their duty to swiftly, transparently, and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof,&quot; Borell said in a statement. &quot;We condemn all contraventions of international norms and join calls from international and local observers for a full investigation of all reports of election-related violations.&quot; Blinken encouraged &quot;Georgia&#x2019;s political leaders to respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, and address deficiencies in the electoral process together.&quot; &quot;While international and local observers agreed that Election Day was generally well administered, we note reports of irregularities and sporadic violence. &#xA0;International observers have not declared the result to be free and fair,&quot; the U.S. chief diplomat said. After the results of the Oct. 26 vote were announced, Georgian opposition groups refused to recognize the result and said the election was stolen, pointing to election monitors reporting various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. According to a report by the Election Observation Mission led by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), &quot;the election day was&#x2026; marked by a tense environment, with frequent compromises in vote secrecy and several procedural inconsistencies, as well as reports of intimidation and pressure on voters&#x2026; especially on public sector voters.&quot; The Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led the country closer to Moscow, hampering its EU aspirations. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year led to the EU effectively freezing Georgia&apos;s accession process, even though it was awarded candidate status last December. Tbilisi&apos;s relations with Washington also deteriorated over the past months as the U.S. began curbing partnership programs and imposed sanctions against Georgian officials.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-eu-georgian-elections/	2024-10-28T00:16:20-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2160746692.jpg

Russia's attack on Kharkiv Oblast injures 21, Ukrainian officials report	At least 21 people were injured overnight on Oct. 28, including five children, as Russia launched multiple air attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, State Emergency Service reported. The attack damaged a high-rise and destroyed at least three apartments in the city of Kharkiv, according to Mayor Ihor Terekhov. First responders have been dispatched to the sites of the attacks. Earlier on Oct. 27, six people were injured following the attacks in the city&apos;s Saltivskyi and Shevchenkivskyi districts. Terekhov added that at least 21 private residences and four cars were damaged in the strike. Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on Telegram that in the city of Chuhuiv, a warehouse building was destroyed in an attack, though no injuries were reported. Kharkiv has endured constant Russian attacks for over two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last few months have seen intensifying strikes against densely-populated areas of the city. Ukrainian officials have also warned that Moscow is once again preparing to carry out strikes against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months, causing blackouts and disruptions to essential services.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-strikes-in-kharkiv-oblast-injure-21-ukrainian-officials-report/	2024-10-27T22:57:48-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-27-23_52_46.jpeg
Zelensky claims PM Modi can help end war in 'Times of India' interview	President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the potential role of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in mediating peace talks to end the ongoing war in Ukraine. &quot;Modi is the PM of a really huge country from the perspective of population, economy, influence and impact. Such a country cannot just say we are interested in the end of the war &#x2013; we are all interested in that. PM Modi can influence the end of the Ukraine war. This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is the huge value of India,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 28 in an interview with the &quot;Times of India.&quot; The president also expressed optimism about the possibility of negotiations taking place in India: &quot;Undoubtedly it can be in India and PM Modi can really do that... but I think we need to prepare ourselves... and only according to our format because the war is in our land... we have the platform which is the peace summit.&quot; With winter approaching and ongoing attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, the country faces significant challenges, including pressure from Russian advances across Donetsk Oblast and uncertainties surrounding U.S. support amid upcoming presidential elections. Zelensky warned that a Trump victory could jeopardize vital military aid for Kyiv. Zelensky underscored the importance of strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s energy systems and reiterated that the recently revealed victory plan and NATO membership are aimed at fortifying Ukraine&#x2019;s position for future negotiations: &quot;The Victory Plan is not a bargaining chip or a topic of negotiations with Russia... What we are asking for is an invitation to NATO so that in the future nobody can change their opinion.&quot; Zelensky also urged Modi to take concrete actions rather than mere rhetoric, saying that India&apos;s influence could be pivotal in addressing issues such as the return of Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia. &quot;You can force Putin to bring back Ukrainian children... Let PM Modi bring back at least 1,000 Ukrainian children.&quot; A historical ally of Russia, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-tells-times-of-india-pm-modi-can-influence-end-of-war/	2024-10-27T21:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/bbda75822c936b21a2a721ef46f66183_1724407316_extra_large.jpeg
JD Vance says Taiwan more vital to US than Ukraine due to key role in chip production	Republican Senator and vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance questioned the importance of Ukraine to U.S. strategic interests on a recent episode of &quot;The Tim Dillon Show&quot; podcast, which aired on Oct. 26. &#xA0; Vance suggested that Ukraine is less crucial than other regions, specifically Taiwan, which he highlighted as the world&#x2019;s leading producer of semiconductor chips. &quot;My whole argument with the Russia-Ukraine (war) is that Russia should have never invaded Ukraine, a lot of innocent people are being killed... Our interest is in peace. But part of that is motivated by my view that Ukraine is not nearly as important to us as other regions of the world, right? Just putting my cards on the table,&quot; Vance told Tim Dillon, an American stand-up comedian, who questioned Vance on various topics, including those related to foreign policy. &quot;Taiwan makes so much of the computer chips, which is such a driver of all economic growth, that if the Chinese took over Taiwan, it would be really bad for us.&quot; When asked about the cause of the war in Ukraine, Vance replied: &quot;Did American diplomacy actually create conflict instead of diffusing conflict? In my view, it did.&quot; Vance, who was selected as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump&apos;s running mate in July, has been outspoken about his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine. He repeatedly has said that he &quot;doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine,&quot; including just days after the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Vance also repeatedly disparaged Ukraine and voiced his unwillingness to continue U.S. support in leaked text messages with far-right conspiracy theorist Charles Johnson, the Washington Post reported on Aug. 7. Vance also rejected the notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin would extend his military operations beyond Ukraine into Europe. He labeled the idea of Putin marching through Europe as &quot;absurd&quot; and expressed doubt about the likelihood of Putin pursuing goals beyond his current objectives in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vance-says-taiwan-more-vital-to-us-than-ukraine-due-to-key-role-in-chip-production/	2024-10-27T19:59:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2153568546.jpg
Canada ships first armored combat support vehicles to Ukraine	Canada has provided Ukraine with a new shipment of Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs) 6.0 ACSV specially configured as ambulances, the Canadian Armed Forces&#x2019; Operation UNIFIER announced on Oct. 26. Armored Combat Support Vehicles (ACSVs) are an extension of the existing LAV 6.0 family of vehicles in service with the Canadian army. Although the exact number of vehicles remains unknown, this delivery comes after extensive training for Ukrainian personnel in Germany. This contribution is part of Canada&#x2019;s ongoing military assistance to Ukraine, which has amounted to nearly $4.5 billion since 2022. In September 2023, Canada committed to transferring 50 LAV 6.0 ACSV to Ukraine over a three-year period, as part of a $650 million investment in military aid. Following the operator and maintenance training on the ACSV, ambulance variant, in Germany, the vehicles were loaded up and sent to Ukraine.These vehicles will help Ukraine in their ongoing defence of an unlawful invasion to their land #SlavaUkraini pic.twitter.com/tibGiSfgxX Earlier this year, Canada announced additional support, including 80,840 CRV-7 rocket motors, 1,300 warheads, machine guns and pistols, and M113 chassis. Canada has placed no geographical restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s use of Canadian-donated tanks and armored vehicles. This policy positions Canada among the countries&#x2014;including Germany, the U.S., and the U.K.&#x2014;that have approved using most Western-supplied equipment in Ukraine&#x2019;s current operations in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/canada-ships-first-armored-combat-support-vehicles-to-ukraine/	2024-10-27T18:39:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GakZWxCWUAAw5-E.jpeg
Russia's attacks kill 5 civilians in Kherson Oblast	At least five civilians were killed and four injured in Russian attacks on Oct. 27 in Ukraine&#x2019;s southern Kherson Oblast, which remains divided by the front line and frequently endures Russian artillery, drone, and missile strikes, according to the regional governor. An elderly man died after a drone dropped explosives on him, and others were killed by artillery fire, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported via his Telegram channel. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his Oct. 27 address that Russia had deployed over 1,100 guided aerial bombs, 560 attack drones, and around 20 missiles against Ukraine in the past week. &quot;Russia continues its terror campaign against Ukraine, with daily assaults on our people, towns, and villages, employing a range of weapons,&quot; Zelensky said, urging Kyiv&#x2019;s allies to increase pressure on Moscow. Earlier on Oct. 27, Ukraine&#x2019;s military reported that air defenses had intercepted 44 out of 91 Russian drones launched overnight, adding that the attacks caused damages to civilian infrastructure in northeastern Sumy Oblast and in the city of Dnipro.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-attacks-kill-5-civilians-in-kherson-oblast/	2024-10-27T16:46:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kherson-1.jpeg
Kyiv appeals to UN, Red Cross after reports of Russian soldiers murdering civilians in Selydove	Ukraine&apos;s Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 27 that he had written to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations after reports circulated on social media alleging that Russian soldiers had killed two civilian women in Selydove. Ukrainian prosecutors launched a war crime investigation on Oct. 27 in response to social media footage and other reports that Russian soldiers in the Donetsk Oblast town of Selydove have opened fire against civilians on separate occasions, killing at least two women and injuring one person. &quot;The alleged shooting of two women by the occupiers in Selydove is a war crime,&quot; Lubinets said. &quot;I immediately sent letters to international organizations: UN and ICRC. I am waiting for a response.&quot; The embattled Selydove has seen heavy fighting as Russian forces push deeper into the settlement, which lies 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Ukraine&apos;s key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. One posted video purports to show Russian soldiers opening fire on a civilian car in a populated area on Oct. 24. A local resident was reportedly injured in the shooting, the prosecutor&apos;s office said. Other reports allege that in another incident, two women were murdered by Russian troops. The bodies were found in a residential sector that was not heavily affected by hostilities and likely already under Russian control, according to prosecutors. Kyiv has accused Russia of committing over 137,000 war crimes in Ukraine as part of its aggression. Earlier this week, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said that Russian soldiers killed four captured Ukrainian servicemen near Selydove.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-appeals-to-un-red-cross-after-reports-of-russian-soldiers-murdering-civilians-in-selydove/	2024-10-27T14:56:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1246182421.jpeg
Drone damages industrial facility in Russia's Voronezh Oblast, governor says	Debris from a downed drone struck an industrial facility in Russia&apos;s Voronezh Oblast the evening of Oct. 27, regional governor Alexander Gusev said via his official Telegram channel. Russian air defense units intercepted multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the region, Gusev claimed. &quot;As a result of the fall of one UAV, an annex to a utility room at an industrial enterprise was damaged,&quot; he said. According to Gusev, no casualties have been reported. The Astra Telegram channel posted video footage purporting to show an explosion at a facility in Voronezh Oblast at the time of the reported drone strike. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Oct. 27 that seven drones were shot down over Voronezh, Belgorod, and Bryansk oblasts. Kyiv has not yet commented on these reports. Ukraine has launched a series of drone strikes aimed at damaging Russia&apos;s military infrastructure and oil industry. Ukraine on Oct. 4 attacked the Annanefteprodukt fuel and lubricants storage base near the village of Anna in Voronezh Oblast, according to the General Staff. A source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent later that the oil depot was struck by drones operated by the SBU.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-damages-industrial-facility-in-russias-voronezh-oblast-governor-says/	2024-10-27T14:07:39-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-2159777032--1-.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia transporting North Korean troops to front lines in civilian trucks, military intelligence says	Key developments on Oct. 27: Russia is transporting North Korean soldiers to the front lines via trucks with civilian license plates, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Oct. 27. The announcement follows reports from U.S. and Ukrainian officials that a contingent of North Korean troops is headed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to assist Moscow in countering Ukraine&apos;s offensive in the region. Russian police officers on Oct. 27 stopped a Kamaz truck with civilian license plates on the Kursk-Voronezh highway, HUR said via its official Telegram channel. The vehicle was reportedly loaded with North Korean military personnel, but the driver did not have documented combat orders. In an intercepted radio communication, officers of Russia&apos;s 810th Separate Marine Brigade are trying to sort out the problem of the stopped truck, according to audio published by HUR. The unit was expecting to receive North Korean reinforcements via the Kamaz truck. The audio records the officers discussing why the truck was stopped on the Kursk-Voronezh highway and why the driver lacked proper documentation. HUR&apos;s report indicates that North Korean troops are on their way to Russian units, aligning with President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s announcement on Oct. 25 that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. While Russia and North Korea first dismissed Ukraine&apos;s reports that North Korean troops were joining the war, the leaders of the two countries have changed their language in recent days, moving from denial to justification. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Oct. 24 indirectly acknowledged the presence of North Korean soldiers in Russia, responding to claims of satellite imagery with &quot;if there are images, they reflect something&quot; and citing Pyongyang&apos;s defense treaty with Moscow. North Korea&apos;s foreign ministry said on Oct. 25 that any decision to send troops to Russia would comply with international law. Estimates on the number of North Korean troops sent to the Ukraine-Russia front line have varied. U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December, while Kyiv has said that Pyongyang has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. Russian soldiers in the Donetsk Oblast town of Selydove have likely opened fire against civilians on separate occasions, killing at least two women and injuring one person, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said on Oct. 27. Selydove is the site of heavy battles as Russian forces are pushing deeper into the settlement, which lies 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Ukraine&apos;s key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crime investigation into footage and reports shared on social media that accuse Russian soldiers of shooting at and murdering the town&apos;s residents. One video purports to show Russian soldiers opening fire against a civilian car in a populated area on Oct. 24. One resident was injured and was provided assistance by Ukrainian soldiers who arrived at the scene afterward, the prosecutor&apos;s office said. In a separate incident, two women have been reportedly murdered by Russian troops. The bodies have been found in a residential sector that was not heavily affected by hostilities and likely already under Russian control, the prosecutors said, citing media reports and open sources. An investigation to establish circumstances and perpetrators is underway, the statement read. Kyiv has accused Russia of committing over 137,000 war crimes in Ukraine as part of its aggression. There have been numerous reports of murder and torture of civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war as Moscow continues its all-out war and holds roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Ukrainian forces continue to hold all the dominant heights near Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and are attempting to restore their positions, Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said on air on Oct. 27. The spokesperson said this in reaction to a recent report by the Ukrainian monitoring service DeepState, which claimed that Russian forces had captured the settlement. The Ukrainian military warned that Russia is escalating its operations in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, just as it continues its drive in the Donbas region in Ukraine&apos;s east. Voloshyn said he would not call Levadne a settlement but a simple &quot;point in an open field&quot; positioned in a lowland, which makes it difficult to defend. The spokesperson acknowledged that Russian forces have focused great efforts in the sector, achieving &quot;partial success&quot; and driving a wedge into Ukrainian defenses. He did not say explicitly whether the entire Levadne was captured, as DeepState reported. According to Voloshyn, Russia has intensified its operations in the area after capturing the Donetsk Oblast town of Vuhledar at the beginning of October. Levadne is located near the administrative borders of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts, around 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Vuhledar and 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of the city of Zaporizhzhia. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported downing 51 Ukrainian drones overnight on Oct. 27, with 18 of them intercepted over western Tambov Oblast. Drones struck the Michurinsky district of the region at around 0:40 a.m. local time, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, Governor Maxim Egorov claimed on his Telegram channel. The Astra Telegram channel alleged that the fire broke out at the Transneft Druzhba control station in the village of Novonikolskoye. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Transneft Druzhba is a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s leading state-controlled oil company, Transneft. It operates the Druzhba pipeline, built to funnel Russian oil to European countries via Belarus and Ukraine. The Michurinsky Oil Refinery is also located in the village of Novonikolskoye. Ukraine has carried out long-range drone strikes into Russian territory, often targeting oil refineriesand depots to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and diminish Moscow&apos;s fossil fuel export revenues, crucial for funding the war. Russia claimed its forces had also downed 16 drones over Belgorod Oblast, four each over Bryansk, Lipetsk, and Oryol oblasts, three over Voronezh Oblast, and one over Kursk Oblast. Other Ukrainian drones were allegedly shot down over the Azov Sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-transporting-north-korean-troops-to-front-lines-in-civilian-trucks-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-27T13:14:30-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166685743.jpg
To protect Taiwan, help Ukraine defeat Russia, former UK defense secretary says	If Western nations allow Russia to defeat Ukraine, China will see it as a signal to invade Taiwan, former U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said in an editorial for the Sunday Times published Oct. 26. Fears of escalating Chinese military intervention in Taiwan have risen sharply since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The war has served as a possible model of how both Taipei and the international community might respond if Beijing decides to invade. &quot;(W)e have the opportunity to send a clear message to the Chinese leadership that subjugating the neighboring democracy by force will never be acceptable,&quot; Shapps wrote in the Sunday Times. &quot;We must send this message by acting much closer to home, here in Europe.&quot; Stepping up support for Ukraine is the most effective way to deter China from attacking Taiwan, Shapps writes, saying a conflict between Beijing and Taipei would have a devastating impact on the global economy. &quot;Now is therefore the time not only to provide long-range permission for our Storm Shadow missiles but to do so without awaiting a decision from Washington,&quot; Shapps said. The Ukrainian military has received British Storm Shadows, long-range missiles that can fly up to 250 kilometers (150 miles), but is not permitted to use them on Russian soil. Kyiv has urged its allies to lift restrictions on the use of Western-provided weapons, a step that is also included in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;The cost of allowing the use of our weapons, even inside Russia if (Russian President Vladimir) Putin attacks from there, would be minimal compared with the consequences of Putin winning &#x2014; and thereby allowing others to believe that you can time out the West&#x2019;s interest,&quot; Shapps said. Shapps called on the U.K. and other Western goverments to ramp up their military aid to Ukraine, arguing that a strong defense of Ukraine alongside &quot;peaceful political discussion&quot; with China offered the best strategy to protect Taiwan and avoid escalated global conflict. &quot;Redoubling our support for Ukraine today would not only be doing the right thing but would also make an invasion of Taiwan much less likely, thereby protecting us from a recession or even depression,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/taiwan-at-risk-if-russia-prevails-in-ukraine-former-uk-defense-secretary-says/	2024-10-27T12:38:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1701095780.jpg
JD Vance declines to call Putin enemy, calls for negotiations with Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin is more a &quot;competitor&quot; or &quot;adversary&quot; to the U.S. than an enemy, Republican Senator and vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance said in an interview with NBC News on Oct. 27. Vance&apos;s comments come just over one week before the U.S. presidential election, which carries high stakes for the future of American military support to Ukraine. &quot;I think that he&apos;s clearly an adversary. He is a competitor,&quot; Vance told NBC News when asked if he considers Putin an ally or enemy. &quot;But I think that we also have to be smart about diplomacy, too. Just because we don&apos;t like somebody, doesn&apos;t mean that we can&apos;t occasionally engage in conversations with them.&quot; Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&apos;s relationship with Putin has been the subject of increased scrutiny in light of recent allegations that he held multiple phone calls with the Russian president after leaving the White House. Trump frequently touts his good relationship with Putin on the campaign trail and has blamed U.S. President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky for Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion while failing to mention Putin. He has repeatedly called Zelensky a &quot;salesman&quot; who needs to &quot;make a deal&quot; with Russia. Vance went on to say in the interview that negotiations with Moscow are &quot;a necessary part&quot; of ending the war in Ukraine. &quot;I think it&apos;s important if we&apos;re ever going to end the war in Ukraine, fundamentally, at some level, we&apos;re going to have to engage in some sort of negotiation between Ukraine, between Russia, between our NATO allies in Europe,&quot; he said. Vance did not detail any potential outcomes of those negotiations, but has previously said Trump&apos;s peace plan could include establishing a so-called &quot;demilitarized zone&quot; between Ukraine and Russia, presumably resembling the current line of demarcation between the countries. Zelensky called Vance&apos;s plan &quot;too radical&quot; and said he did not accept plans to end the war that came at Ukraine&apos;s expense. Vance has said multiple times that he &quot;doesn&apos;t care about Ukraine,&quot; including just days after the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/jd-vance-declines-to-call-putin-enemy-calls-for-negotiations-with-russia/	2024-10-27T11:44:52-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176025411.jpg
Georgian president does not recognize election results, calls for protests	Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said on Oct. 27 that she will not recognize the results of the country&apos;s recent parliamentary elections and called for citizens to join her in mass demonstrations. The ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party won a majority in the Oct. 26 vote, according to Georgia&apos;s electoral commission. Pro-EU parties have disputed the result, and European monitors also said the elections were characterized by intimidation and irregularities. &quot;I do not recognize these elections,&quot; President Zourabichvili said in a press conference on Oct. 27, as reported by the Echo of the Caucasus. &quot;These elections cannot be recognized. This is the same as recognizing Georgia&apos;s subordination to Russia. ... No one can take away Georgia&apos;s European future.&quot; Zourabichvili called the result a &quot;total falsification&quot; and described the election as a &quot;Russian special operation.&quot; She urged citizens to join her at Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Rustaveli Avenue to protest the falsified election. &quot;We must stand together and declare that we do not recognize these elections, we do not tolerate Russia and its invasion of Georgia in this form,&quot; she said. &quot;We will stand together. ... I would like to invite you all to Rustaveli tomorrow, at 7 p.m., so that we can say together, declare to the whole world that we do not recognize these elections, we are defending constitutional rights.&quot; The president&apos;s words echo those of former Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, an opposition leader, who said that the results &quot;do not reflect the will of the Georgian people&quot; and called for &quot;reasonable forms of protest&quot; to &quot;defend the European future&quot; of the country. The Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has led the country closer to Moscow and hampering its EU aspirations. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year led to the EU effectively freezing Georgia&apos;s accession process, even though it was awarded candidate status last December. The passing of the foreign agents bill sparked widespread protests across the country. The party also said it would seek a constitutional ban on UNM, one of the country&apos;s leading opposition parties founded by former President Mikheil Saakashvili, and other opposition groups. After the results of the Oct. 26 vote were announced, Georgian opposition groups refused to recognize the result and said the election was stolen, pointing to election monitors reporting various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. European election observers also noted concerns with Georgia&apos;s electoral process. &quot;During our observation, we noted the cases of vote buying and double voting before and during elections, especially in rural areas,&quot; said Ioan Bulai, the head of the delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). &quot;The presence of cameras of the ruling party in the polling stations, and people in front of polling stations tracking and possibly controlling voters, led to the atmosphere of pressure and party-organized intimidation.&quot; Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said on Oct. 27 that the Georgian parliament will approve the government despite protests by the opposition.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-president-does-not-recognize-election-calls-for-protests/	2024-10-27T11:20:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180328725.jpg
Russia transporting North Korean troops to front lines in civilian trucks, military intelligence says	Russia is transporting North Korean soldiers to the front lines via trucks with civilian license plates, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported on Oct. 27. The announcement follows reports from U.S. and Ukrainian officials that a contingent of North Korean troops is headed to Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast to assist Moscow in countering Ukraine&apos;s offensive in the region. &#xA0; Russian police officers on Oct. 27 stopped a Kamaz truck with civilian license plates on the Kursk-Voronezh highway, HUR said via its official Telegram channel. The vehicle was reportedly loaded with North Korean military personnel, but the driver did not have documented combat orders. In an intercepted radio communication, officers of Russia&apos;s 810th Separate Marine Brigade are trying to sort out the problem of the stopped truck, according to audio published by HUR. The unit was expecting to receive North Korean reinforcements via the Kamaz truck. The audio records the officers discussing why the truck was stopped on the Kursk-Voronezh highway and why the driver lacked proper documentation. HUR&apos;s report indicates that North Korean troops are on their way to Russian units, aligning with President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s announcement on Oct. 25 that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. While Russia and North Korea first dismissed Ukraine&apos;s reports that North Korean troops were joining the war, the leaders of the two countries have changed their language in recent days, moving from denial to justification.

Georgian elections accompanied by vote buying, intimidation, European monitors say	The Georgian parliamentary elections were marred by intimidation and irregularities before and during the vote, European monitors said on Oct. 27 after the ruling party claimed victory. The country&apos;s electoral commission said the ruling Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party won 53.9% in the Oct. 26 vote that was described as pivotal for Georgia&apos;s EU aspirations. Some pro-EU opposition parties refused to recognize the result and said the election was stolen, pointing to election monitors reporting various violations, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. &quot;During our observation, we noted the cases of vote buying and double voting before and during elections, especially in rural areas,&quot; said Ioan Bulai, the head of the delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). &quot;The presence of cameras of the ruling party in the polling stations, and people in front of polling stations tracking and possibly controlling voters, led to the atmosphere of pressure and party-organized intimidation.&quot; Pascal Allizard, who led the mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), undesrcored &quot;imbalances in financial resources, a divisive campaign atmosphere, and recent legislative amendments were of significant concern throughout this election process.&quot; Allizard said the legal framework for the elections was &quot;adequate&quot; and the vote was &quot;largely peaceful,&quot; though recent amendments reversed some previous positive changes. Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White, the head of the European Parliament delegation, said that the &quot;ruling party used anti-Western and hostile rhetoric, targeting Georgia&#x2019;s democratic partners, in particular the European Union, its politicians and diplomats, promoted Russian disinformation, manipulation, and conspiracy theories.&quot; &quot;Reports of irregularities in Georgian elections give rise to grave concern,&quot; Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on X. The German Foreign Ministry declared that it &quot;fully supports preliminary findings &amp; conclusions&quot; of the OSCE mission and is &quot;concerned about the reported tense environment and irregularities.&quot; &quot;The handling of the election outcome &amp; government formation will also affect the future progress of Georgia on its European path,&quot; the ministry said on social media. In turn, Georgian Dream has received congratulations from several world leaders, including neighboring Azerbaijan and Armenia, while Russian and Hungarian officials have praised the results. The Coalition for Change, one of the opposition groups that won 10.9% of the vote, said it would not &quot;legitimize votes stolen from Georgian citizens&quot; by taking up their parliamentary mandates. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze dismissed the opposition&apos;s protests and said the parliament would approve the government nonetheless. The ruling party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has seen the South Caucasus country drift ever closer to Moscow, hampering its EU aspirations. Tbilisi&apos;s adoption of the controversial foreign agents law earlier this year led to the EU effectively freezing Georgia&apos;s accession process, even though it was awarded candidate status last December. The ruling party said it would also seek a constitutional ban on UNM, one of the country&apos;s leading opposition parties founded by former President Mikheil Saakashvili, and other opposition groups. The introduction and passing of the foreign agents bill has sparked widespread protests across the country, both in March 2023 and in May this year. A large rally in support of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union was also held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20, one week before the elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-elections-accompanied-by-vote-buying-intimidation-international-observers-say/	2024-10-27T09:08:25-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181116623.jpg
Russia mulls 'various responses' if West aids Ukraine with long-range strikes, Putin says	The Russian Defense Ministry is considering &quot;various options&quot; as a response if Ukraine launches long-range strikes against Russia with Western support, Russian President Vladimir Putin told state media in an interview published on Oct. 27. The Kremlin&apos;s chief has reiterated his threats to the West if it takes this step, claiming that Ukraine would be able to launch such attacks only with the direct involvement of NATO military personnel. The Ukrainian military has received long-range missiles like the American ATACMS, British Storm Shadow, or French SCALP/T but is not permitted to use them on Russian soil. Ukraine has called on its allies to lift restrictions on the use of Western-provided weapons, a step that has also been included in President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s five-step victory plan. &quot;We will have to respond to this accordingly,&quot; Putin said. &quot;Our military leadership is considering this and will present various options in response.&quot; Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. Despite rumors in September that Washington and London are considering easing the restrictions, the ban has remained in place. Putin claimed already then that the move would &quot;mean nothing less than the direct involvement of NATO countries&quot; in the war and threatened a response.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-threatens-west-over-long-range-strikes/	2024-10-27T08:19:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178238738.jpg
Zelensky open to integrating China's, Brazil's proposals into peace formula, Yermak says	President Volodymyr Zelensky is willing to listen to peace initiatives from China, Brazil, South Africa, and other countries and eventually integrate them into Ukraine&apos;s peace formula, Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said in an interview with Corriere della Sera published on Oct. 27. Ukraine will finalize its formula by early November and will be open to incorporating other initiatives by then, Yermak told the Italian newspaper. &quot;At that point, our proposal will have significant support,&quot; he added. The statement comes as an apparent shift from Zelensky&apos;s earlier position. Last month, the president blasted the six-point proposal drafted by Brazil and China as &quot;destructive&quot; China and Brazil proposed the plan in parallel to Ukraine&apos;s ongoing peace efforts based on Zelensky&apos;s 10-point peace formula, which includes Russia&apos;s withdrawal from Ukraine, the release of captives, restoration of territorial integrity, and more. The document served as a basis for the global peace summit held in Switzerland in June. Russia was not invited to attend, but Ukrainian officials aim to invite Russian representatives to a second summit to present them with a peace plan developed by Ukraine and international partners. Asked about the Kremlin&apos;s views on Ukraine&apos;s peace plan, Yermak said he &quot;doesn&apos;t care what the aggressor says.&quot; Russia has not shown interest in participating in the second summit and has dismissed Zelensky&apos;s peace formula. Talking to state television on Oct. 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he does not plan &quot;any concessions&quot; and that any peace agreement must favor Moscow. &quot;We will be ready to hold the international conference when we feel strong and supported, also by the Global South, to negotiate with Russia,&quot; Yermak commented. He said he is unsure whether the conference will have to be postponed until next year but voiced hope it will be organized &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Ukraine finds itself in an increasingly difficult position as Russian forces keep advancing in the country&apos;s east, and a potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after the Nov. 5 election sparks fears of the U.S. pulling its support. Yermak said Kyiv is not afraid of the U.S. vote results, proclaiming, &quot;I don&apos;t think any American leader wants to facilitate the victory of an autocracy like Russia.&quot; The Presidential Office chief reminded that Zelensky met U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic Party&apos;s candidate for the election, as well as Trump, during his visit to the U.S. last month. &quot;I was there, I won&apos;t give details... but I can say that we returned from the United States certain that neither candidate is willing to let Putin win this war and that military support will continue,&quot; Yermak said in the interview. The Ukrainian official was also asked about the supposed centralization of power under the Presidential Office and the dismissals of popular figures like former Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi or ex-Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. &quot;There were very internal considerations, which few know,&quot; Yermak said. &quot;We need colleagues who remain totally available for their work; it is a total physical and moral effort.&quot; Zaluzhnyi was replaced by Oleksandr Syrskyi in February after rumors of a growing rift between the commander and the Presidential Office. Kuleba was dismissed in early September amid a wide-reaching government reshuffle and replaced by Andrii Sybiha, Yermak&apos;s former deputy. Yermak, who has led Zelensky&apos;s office since February 2020, has been described as &quot;arguably the most powerful chief of staff in Ukraine&apos;s history&quot; and criticized for accumulating power within the Presidential Office.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-china-brazil-peace-proposal/	2024-10-27T07:40:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2030107886.jpg
Russia had 'partial success' at Levadne but Ukraine holds dominant heights, military says	Ukrainian forces continue to hold all the dominant heights near Levadne in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and are attempting to restore their positions, Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said on air on Oct. 27. The spokesperson said this in reaction to a recent report by the Ukrainian monitoring service DeepState, which claimed that Russian forces had captured the settlement. The Ukrainian military warned that Russia is escalating its operations in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, just as it continues its drive in the Donbas region in Ukraine&apos;s east.

Ukraine to hold elections 'immediately after war,' Zelensky's chief of staff says	Ukraine will hold elections &quot;immediately&quot; after the end of the war to allow all soldiers and refugees to vote, Presidential Office chief Andriy Yermak said in an interview with Corriere della Sera published on Oct. 27. &quot;(President Volodymyr) Zelensky is very clear; he wants all soldiers and refugees abroad to be able to vote,&quot; Yermak told the Italian newspaper. &quot;But for now, resources must go to the war.&quot; Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in March or April 2024, concluding Zelensky&apos;s first five-year term. The vote was postponed as the country&apos;s constitution does not permit elections under martial law, which was declared on Feb. 24, 2022, at the onset of Russia&apos;s all-out invasion. Zelensky, who has held the office since May 2019, said in December 2023 that he is ready to hold the presidential election, but most Ukrainians think such a vote would be &quot;dangerous and meaningless&quot; in wartime. His statement was supported by several polls, with 70% of Ukrainians saying Zelensky should remain in office until the end of martial law. Russia and various anti-Ukrainian voices have sought to utilize the postponement of elections to cast doubt on the country&apos;s commitment to democracy and undermine the president&apos;s legitimacy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-hold-elections-immediately-after-war/	2024-10-27T05:31:06-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168960421.jpg
Russian soldiers suspected of murdering 2, injuring 1 civilian in embattled Selydove	Russian soldiers in the Donetsk Oblast town of Selydove have likely opened fire against civilians on separate occasions, killing at least two women and injuring one person, the regional prosecutor&apos;s office said on Oct. 27. Selydove is the site of heavy battles as Russian forces are pushing deeper into the settlement, which lies 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Ukraine&apos;s key logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crime investigation into footage and reports shared on social media that accuse Russian soldiers of shooting at and murdering the town&apos;s residents. One video purports to show Russian soldiers opening fire against a civilian car in a populated area on Oct. 24. One resident was injured and was provided assistance by Ukrainian soldiers who arrived at the scene afterward, the prosecutor&apos;s office said.

The bodies have been found in a residential sector that was not heavily affected by hostilities and likely already under Russian control, the prosecutors said, citing media reports and open sources. An investigation to establish circumstances and perpetrators is underway, the statement read. Kyiv has accused Russia of committing over 137,000 war crimes in Ukraine as part of its aggression. There have been numerous reports of murder and torture of civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war as Moscow continues its all-out war and holds roughly one-fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory. Earlier this week, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said that Russian soldiers killed four captured Ukrainian servicemen near Selydove.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-shooting-civilians-selydove/	2024-10-27T04:49:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Photo-Selydove.jpg
Ukraine's FM visits South Africa to conclude his Mideast, Africa tour	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha arrived in South Africa on Oct. 27 for a two-day visit to meet his South African counterpart Ronald Lamola and other top officials and public leaders. The visit to Johannesburg and Pretoria will conclude Sybiha&apos;s tour across the Middle East and the African continent as he seeks to strengthen ties and drum up support for Ukraine&apos;s peace formula. Apart from government officials, Ukraie&apos;s chief diplomat will also meet South African business leaders and the expert community, namely the research and teaching staff of the University of Pretoria, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The discussions will focus on Ukraine-South Africa cooperation, the role of the peace formula &quot;as a single path to a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace,&quot; and relations with South Africa as the presiding member of the G20 in 2025. South Africa, the largest economy on the continent, has claimed neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war but continued to strengthen its economic and political ties with Moscow. The country is a member of the BRICS group alongside Russia, China, and others, and it even carried out joint naval drills with the two countries last year. Sybiha previously visited Oman, Angola, and Egypt within the tour. His predecessor, Dmytro Kuleba, carried out four diplomatic tours across Africa as part of Kyiv&apos;s efforts to bolster ties in the Global South and challenge Russian influence abroad.

Georgia's government will be approved despite opposition's protests, PM says after elections	The Georgian parliament will approve the government despite protests by the opposition, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said on Oct. 27 as his party declared victory in the elections. The country&apos;s electoral commission said that the ruling Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party won 54% of the vote, dashing hopes of the pro-EU opposition. Georgian opposition refused to recognize the result and said the election was &quot;stolen,&quot; pointing to election monitors reporting various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. According to official results, the opposition parties and coalitions that crossed the 5% threshold included the Coalition for Change (10.9%), United National Movement (UNM, 10.1%), Strong Georgia (8.8%), and Gakharia For Georgia (7.8%). Former Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, the chair of the opposition Gakharia For Georgia party, said that the announced results &quot;do not reflect the will of the Georgian people&quot; and called for &quot;reasonable forms of protest&quot; to &quot;defend the European future and the institution of elections.&quot; &quot;We (will) fight for every vote, use all legal means to protect the democratic and European choice of the Georgian people,&quot; Anna Dolidze, one of the leaders of the Strong Georgia coalition, said. A coalition of Georgian observers demanded the annulment of the results over purported cases of electoral fraud, including violations of voter secrecy, use of threats, obstruction of observers, and other violations. &#xA0; Speaking at a press briefing after the elections, Kobakhidze dismissed the opposition&apos;s protests as a &quot;desperate attempt to justify themselves in front of their voters.&quot; &quot;Once again, some NGOs and radical political parties have come out against the constitutional order of the country for the third time in four years,&quot; the prime minister said. Georgian Dream has already received congratulations from several world leaders, including neighboring Azerbaijan and Armenia, while Russian and Hungarian officials have praised the results. The highly anticipated elections are pivotal for Georgia. The ruling party has seen the South Caucasus country drift ever closer to Moscow, hampering its EU aspirations. Tbilisi has been accused of democratic backsliding over the adoption of controversial legislation, namely the foreign agents law targeting NGOs and independent media. The ruling party said it would also seek a constitutional ban on UNM, one of the country&apos;s leading opposition parties founded by former President Mikheil Saakashvili. The introduction and passing of the foreign agents bill has sparked widespread protests across the country, both in March 2023 and in May this year. A large rally in support of Georgia&apos;s accession to the European Union was also held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20, one week before the elections.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-government-elections/	2024-10-27T03:32:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2181106582.jpg
Germany, France skeptical about bypassing Hungary's veto on EU aid for Ukraine, Bloomberg reports	Germany and France are raising doubts about the EU diplomatic service&apos;s proposal to circumvent Hungary&apos;s veto of 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) in defense assistance for Kyiv, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 25, citing undisclosed sources. Budapest has been blocking the disbursement of Kyiv-bound assistance under the European Peace Facility (EPF) for more than a year, causing frustration among other member states. The European External Action Service, the bloc&apos;s diplomatic arm, suggested that member states could make voluntary contributions, allowing the military aid to flow based on decisions of individual countries rather than unanimous consensus. Bloomberg wrote that Paris and Berlin are worried that such a move could endanger the EPF&apos;s role as the EU&apos;s foreign policy tool. As some countries require parliamentary approval for the contribution, this could further complicate and delay the process. The EPF has been a key tool for supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities since 2022 but had been largely depleted earlier this year as member states disagreed on the best way to replenish it and unlock further cash for Ukraine. While the EU approved an additional 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) for Ukraine in the spring, Budapest has been blocking their disbursement. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, seen as the most Kremlin-friendly leader in the bloc, has repeatedly stalled EU aid for Ukraine and obstructed sanctions against Russia. Tensions between Budapest and Brussels escalated during Hungary&apos;s rotating presidency, with EU member states and institutions boycotting Hungarian-held events over Orban&apos;s visit to Moscow in July.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-france-hungary-veto/	2024-10-27T02:36:34-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177631842.jpg
Russia claims downing 51 Ukrainian drones, fire reported at oil facility	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry reported downing 51 Ukrainian drones overnight on Oct. 27, with 18 of them intercepted over western Tambov Oblast. Drones struck the Michurinsky district of the region at around 0:40 a.m. local time, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, Governor Maxim Egorov claimed on his Telegram channel. The Astra Telegram channel alleged that the fire broke out at the Transneft Druzhba control station in the village of Novonikolskoye. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Transneft Druzhba is a subsidiary of Russia&apos;s leading state-controlled oil company, Transneft. It operates the Druzhba pipeline, built to funnel Russian oil to European countries via Belarus and Ukraine. The Michurinsky Oil Refinery is also located in the village of Novonikolskoye. Ukraine has carried out long-range drone strikes into Russian territory, often targeting oil refineries and depots to disrupt fuel supplies to the Russian military and diminish Moscow&apos;s fossil fuel export revenues, crucial for funding the war. Russia claimed its forces had also downed 16 drones over Belgorod Oblast, four each over Bryansk, Lipetsk, and Oryol oblasts, three over Voronezh Oblast, and one over Kursk Oblast. Other Ukrainian drones were allegedly shot down over the Azov Sea.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-claims-downing-51-ukrainian-drones-fire-reported-at-oil-facility/	2024-10-27T01:46:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2059253115.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 5, injure 19 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed five people and injured 19 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Oct. 27. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 41 of the 80 Russian Shahed-type drones launched overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-two drones were lost on Ukrainian territory, and one flew toward Belarus, the statement read. Around 10 attack drones were downed on the outskirts of Kyiv in another drone attack against the capital. No casualties were reported, but the fallen debris damaged a house and two cars in the region. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast killed two people and injured nine, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. One person was killed and three injured during Russian airstrikes against Kostiantynivka on Oct. 26. The second fatality was reported in the village of Mykolaivka. Two injuries were reported in Kurakhove, two in Kostiantynopil, one in Toretsk, and one in Sontsivka. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian attacks killed an 84-year-old man and injured a 65-year-old civilian in the village of Radkove, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Two people were killed and eight injured in Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast, said Oleksandr Prokudin, the regional governor. The two civilians were reportedly killed during Russian shelling of the Stanislav village around 2 p.m. on Oct. 26. Russian drones attacked an energy facility in the Romny district of Sumy Oblast on the morning of Oct. 27, the regional military administration reported. The same morning, one person was reported injured during a drone strike against the Sumy community. Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Khmelnytskyi oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-101/	2024-10-27T01:08:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Kostiantynivka-Oct-27.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 687,600 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 689,040 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 27. This number includes 1,440 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Ukraine, India discuss strengthening defense industry cooperation	Ukraine&apos;s Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin met with India&apos;s Ambassador to Ukraine Ravi Shankar on Oct. 26 to discuss strengthening defense industry cooperation between Kyiv and New Delhi, the Strategic Industries Ministry announced. &quot;Ukraine is open to expanding the scope of partnerships in the defense sector, and we are ready to consider various forms of collaboration,&quot; Smetanin said in a statement released by the Strategic Industries Ministry. &quot;It is important to assess the capabilities and needs of both our countries&apos; defense industries, to identify challenges, and to determine the course we will take.&quot; The meeting follows discussions between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in late September aimed at strengthening cooperation between the two countries. Zelensky and Modi discussed trade, economic and defense cooperation, India&apos;s involvement in Ukraine&apos;s post-war reconstruction, and collaboration in educational, scientific, and cultural initiatives, according to the statement by the president&apos;s office. Ukraine and India approved four cooperation agreements in August during Modi&apos;s first visit to Ukraine. The parties did not disclose the details of the deals. &quot;I welcome the proposal to expand cooperation in the defense industries and assure the Minister of the Embassy&apos;s support in defining specific proposals,&quot; said Shankar, following the meeting. No details were provided on the specifics of the discussions. A historical ally of Russia, India has maintained its close economic and diplomatic ties with Moscow since February 2022, with bilateral trade reaching a historic high in 2023. Ahead of Modi&apos;s first visit to Kyiv in August, the Indian prime minister visited Moscow where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The visit included a widely criticized hug between the two leaders on July 8, hours after Russia bombed the Okhmatdyt children&apos;s hospital in Kyiv, killing two people.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-india-discuss-defense-industry/	2024-10-26T19:15:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/1729960305177.png
Ukrainian-Canadian filmmakers pull out from film festival after being featured alongside 'Russians at War'	Ukrainian-Canadian filmmakers pulled their pro-Ukrainian film &quot;Intercepted&quot; from screening at the Windsor International Film Festival (WIFF) after learning that it would be featured in a lineup alongside the controversial &quot;Russians at War&quot; documentary, the Canadian media outlet Windsor Star reported on Oct. 26. Canadian-Russian director Anastasia Trofimova&apos;s documentary Russians at War has faced criticism for what many perceive as an attempt to whitewash Russian soldiers involved in Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine. Earlier in her career, Trofimova worked for Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed propaganda outlet. The documentary has been criticized for lacking a concrete counter-narrative to Russian propaganda, failing to address documented Russian war crimes, and does not offer a definitive critique of Putin&apos;s regime. The movie was brought into the spotlight when it appeared on the official list of screenings at the prestigious Venice and Toronto film festivals. According to the Windsor Star, Intercepted &#x2014; a film that chronicles the work of Ukrainian intelligence agencies as it intercepts calls from Russian soldiers to family and friend &#x2014; pulled out of the Canadian-based WIFF ahead of its opening night screening. The decision to pull out comes amid widespread protest among Canada&apos;s large Ukrainian-Canadian diaspora. Following protest, organizers at the Toronto International Film Festival decided to pull the film from the schedule, citing security concerns, but later decided to hold a special screening for the film after the end of the festival in September, drawing widespread criticism. Controversy further spread as it was revealed the Russians at War film received $340,000 from the Canada Media Fund. Canadian government officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, have strongly criticized the use of public funds to support a controversial documentary that portrays Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Despite protest from local members of the Ukrainian-Canadian diaspora, WIFF has not removed Russians at War from the festival&apos;s lineup &#x2014; at odds with decisions made earlier this month at film festivals in Athens and Zurich to drop the film. The director of Intercepted, Oksana Karpovych, could not be immediately reached by the Windsor Star for comment. On Oct. 7, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) began investigating Trofimova on the charges of justifying and recognizing the legitimacy of Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine and illegally crossing Ukraine&apos;s internationally recognized borders when filming in the Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-canadian-filmmakers-pull-out-from-film-festival-after-being-featured-alongside-russians-at-war/	2024-10-26T17:19:10-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170326498.jpg
Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh wins Europe’s women's Athlete of the Year award	Olympic gold medalist Yaroslava Muhuchikh took home the title of Europe&#x2019;s women&apos;s Athlete of the Year at the 2024 European Athletics Golden Tracks Awards ceremony on Oct. 26. The 23-year-old high jumper won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games in the women&apos;s high jump event following a jump of 2.00 meters on Aug. 4. Mahuchikh, originally from Dnipro, currently holds the world record for women&apos;s high jump at 2.10 meters and was named world champion in the event in August 2023. The award marks the first time Mahuchikh wins the title of top women&apos;s athlete after finishing as the runner-up for two consecutive years. With the award, Mahuchikh becomes the first Ukrainian senior women&apos;s athlete to win receive the honor. &quot;It&apos;s a completely special moment for me especially for the challenging time for Ukraine,&quot; Mahuchikh said while accepting her award. &quot;But, you know, I am happy to be here... for all my people in Ukraine, and I hope that it brings some happiness during this time.&quot; Following her victory at the Paris Olympics, Mahuchikh said that her medal was &quot;for the whole country.&quot; Dutch track and field sprinter Femke Bol and Britain&apos;s 800-meter star Keely Hodgkinson finished as runners-up in this year&apos;s award ceremony.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-high-jumper-yaroslava-mahuchikh-wins-europes-womens-athlete-of-the-year-award/	2024-10-26T15:55:38-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/gettyimages-2181225605-612x612.jpg
Zelensky signs law allowing foreigners to serve as officers in International Legion	President Volodymyr Zelensky formally signed a bill on Oct. 25 allowing foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine&apos;s International Legion to serve as officers. Until now, volunteers could &#x43E;nly fight as privates or sergeants. Zelensky finalized the passage of the bill after Ukraine&apos;s parliament unanimously adopted amendments to the draft law that led to the changes. Ukraine&apos;s International Legion was launched at the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, attracting foreigners who volunteered to defend Ukraine. Citizens from over 50 countries have joined the unit since the start of the full-scale invasion, including military veterans from the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, Europe, and beyond, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said. The Legion is comprised of two units, one under the jurisdiction of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the other subordinated to the military intelligence agency (HUR). Initially lauded as a PR success, soon it was marred with scandals and stories about misconduct. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s investigation from 2022 revealed leadership misconduct in the unit, both in the parts led by military intelligence and those overseen by the Armed Forces. The passage of the bill comes as Ukrainian officials have declared the situation on the front line as &quot;extremely difficult.&quot; In recent weeks, North Korean soldiers have appeared training alongside Russian forces in the front line regions. Officials have warned, citing intelligence reports, that North Korean troops may join the fight alongside Russian forces as early as Oct. 27-28.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-allowing-foreigners-to-serve-as-officers-in-international-legion/	2024-10-26T15:11:12-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/b7dea112-3446-4665-8c29-fcc96bf7e99b--1-.jpg
Ukraine forced to fight against North Korea in Europe,' Zelensky says	During his evening address on Oct. 26, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that North Korean troops may appear fighting alongside Russian forces on the front line in the coming days. &quot;(Russia is) increasingly engaging North Korea as an ally, and any day now their soldiers may appear on the battlefield fighting against Ukraine,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine will be forced to actually fight against North Korea in Europe.&quot; Zelensky&apos;s comments come amid reports that the Biden administration believes that a contingent of North Korean troops is en route to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region to assist Moscow in countering a Ukrainian offensive launched there in August. Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports, that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. These soldiers are reportedly receiving training at five military training grounds in Ekaterinoslavka, Knyaze-Volkonskoe, and Sergeevka, as well as in Ussuriysk and Ulan-Ude in eastern Russia. Although U.S. officials have not confirmed South Korean reports that North Korean soldiers will engage in direct combat, they estimate the North Korean force could number in the thousands and may rapidly be assigned to combat roles, the Wall Street Journal reports. Estimates on the number of North Korean troops sent to the Ukraine-Russia front line have varied. U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December, while Kyiv has said that Pyongyang has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals. Speaking during his evening address, Zelensky called on Western allies to commit to &quot;stronger decisions in support of Ukraine,&quot; as the threat of the war&apos;s escalation continues to rise. &quot;The world is capable of stopping the war from unfolding. Abstractions and words are not enough for this &#x2013; concrete steps are needed.&quot; On Oct. 24, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said that the country could review its ban on supplying lethal arms to Ukraine in light of &quot;North Korean military activities.&quot; South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-forced-to-fight-against-north-korea-in-europe-zelensky-says/	2024-10-26T14:04:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
Georgian ruling party secures majority with 70% of precincts counted, official results show	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Georgia&#x2019;s ruling Georgian Dream party captured 53% of the vote in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election, with 70% of precincts counted, according to the country&apos;s central electoral commission. The commission reported that the final voter turnout reached 58.94%. Some 3.5 million Georgians were eligible to cast ballots in the polls. Meanwhile, the opposition claimed victory in the election. The European Union has cautioned that this election will shape Georgia&#x2019;s prospects for joining the 27-nation bloc. Polls indicate that most Georgians support EU membership, but accession talks stalled after Georgian Dream passed a law in June that restricts freedom of speech. Election monitors reported various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Less than an hour before polls closed, President Salome Zourabichvili, known for her pro-Western stance, urged opposition voters not to be intimidated. &quot;Don&apos;t get scared. All this is just psychological pressure on you,&quot; she said in a live address on social media.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-ruling-party-secures-majority-with-70-of-precincts-counted-official-results-show/	2024-10-26T12:07:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180430600-1.jpg
Ukraine hopes Washington will support Kyiv's NATO bid after elections, as opposition in Europe persists	The desire to receive an official invitation to NATO tops President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s victory plan. While acknowledging that membership itself is a matter for after the war, Zelensky urged allies to send an invitation before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office in January. The president also said that Ukraine needs to receive an invitation without conditions to cede territory, denying earlier reports that Kyiv might be invited to the alliance without the occupied parts of the country, such as Donetsk and Crimea. But despite the ambitious request, there seems to be little appetite for a fast-tracked invitation while the war is ongoing. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz proclaimed that NATO cannot &quot;become a party of war.&quot; Even if Kyiv sways the hesitant heavyweights &#x2013; U.S. and Germany &#x2013; Ukraine-skeptic governments in Hungary and Slovakia remain a vocal obstacle. In total, at least seven NATO countries are reluctant to grant Ukraine an invitation to join NATO, Politico reported on Oct. 23. Even if that hurdle is overcome, further down the road lies a drawn-out accession process that requires ratification by all the 32 parliaments. &quot;We are talking about a very, very long future,&quot; Volodymyr Ogrysko, Ukraine&apos;s former foreign minister, told the Kyiv Independent. Kyiv applied for membership in September 2022 as Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion was in full swing. Despite Ukraine knocking on the door for two years, the alliance has been hesitant to give a clear signal. Ogrysko was nevertheless crystal clear about why Ukraine needs full membership: &quot;Otherwise, it will be only an invitation for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to repeat this in one or two years&#x2026;And I don&apos;t know why our Western colleagues really do not understand that.&quot; &quot;I would say that at best, extending an invitation could potentially happen relatively quickly following a favorable U.S. election,&quot; Camille Grand, a security and NATO expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Formal accession would follow the post-hot phase of the conflict,&quot; he added. The Vilnius Summit communique from last year stated that Ukraine would &quot;join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.&quot; This vague promise was reiterated this year during the allied gathering in Washington, though it was &quot;upgraded&quot; by saying that Ukraine&apos;s path toward NATO is &quot;irreversible.&quot; These lukewarm pledges come as little surprise. As the allies remain divided on the issue, the 32-member consensus necessary for inviting and admitting a new member remains far off. Kyiv&apos;s NATO prospects have received clear support from at least some allies, namely those on the eastern flank like Poland and the Baltic states. &quot;We see confident support from France. We understand that Britain will support us, and we believe that Italy will as well,&quot; Zelensky said during a press briefing on Oct. 21 attended by the Kyiv Independent. The president nevertheless acknowledged reluctance from some members. The U.S. and Germany, NATO&apos;s largest economies and leading suppliers of military assistance to Ukraine, have represented the main opposition to Kyiv&apos;s fast accession. While Washington was once the leading force behind NATO enlargement, the Biden administration took a much more careful approach, which some observers ascribe to the president&apos;s &quot;Cold War mentality&quot; and fears of an escalation with Russia.

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/ AFP via Getty Images)And even if Biden were to change his position, &quot;there remains&#x2026;real opposition coming from Hungary but also countries more supportive of Ukraine, (such) as Germany,&quot; Grand said. &quot;I, therefore&#x2026; do not expect an invitation to be granted in the short term, even though I believe it would be a powerful signal,&quot; the expert noted. Speaking after meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Kyiv, Zelensky said that he hopes for a more &quot;positive reaction&quot; from Washington after the election. He also believes that U.S. support could nudge other reluctant parties, such as Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary, in a more positive direction. There have been conflicting reports on the current mood in Washington. While the French outlet Le Monde wrote that Biden might be open to an invitation if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the election in November. Politico reports that the opposition on the other side of the Atlantic persists. Getting Washington on board would certainly put strong pressure on other members but would not ensure an immediate invitation. In Berlin, the mood is tepid at best. Speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF on Oct. 24, the chancellor dismissed the &#xA0;appeal for an immediate invitation, adding that a &quot;country at war absolutely cannot become a member of NATO.&quot; &quot;German skepticism about our joining NATO is a fact,&quot; Zelensky acknowledged. Finally, there are the wildcards of Hungary and Slovakia, both led by populist leaders who have repeatedly criticized military assistance for Ukraine over fears of being dragged into the war. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called Zelensky&apos;s victory plan &quot;terrifying,&quot; his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico vowed that he would block Ukraine&apos;s membership as long as he is in office.

(Tobias Schwarz / AFP via Getty Images)But experience shows that despite fiery rhetoric, Bratislava has rarely broken Western consensus on key policy issues. Budapest did, along with Turkey, block the accession of Finland and Sweden but eventually withdrew its opposition after gaining some benefits. &quot;I can imagine that Hungary will make some requests regarding the Hungarian minority in (Ukraine&apos;s) Zakarpattia Oblast,&quot; Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs, told the Kyiv Independent. In a similar fashion, Budapest has used the 75,000-large Hungarian minority in Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region to hamper Kyiv&apos;s EU accession. &quot;Of course, we know how it went with Sweden and Finland&#x2026; in the end, it was only a matter of time before the pressure from the alliance was too strong,&quot; Havlicek added, noting that Bratislava is even less likely to put up real resistance due to its security dependence on the U.S. Nevertheless, Budapest has more reasons to obstruct Ukraine&apos;s invitation and entry than it did with the two Nordic countries. &quot;As criticism of Ukraine and the pro-peace narrative have become such core parts of Fidesz&apos;s (Hungary&apos;s ruling party) politics, it is much harder to imagine that the current Hungarian National Assembly would ratify Ukraine&apos;s accession to NATO,&quot; says Patrik Szicherle, a research fellow at the Globsec think tank. &quot;This does not mean Hungary would never agree, but I think it would take a longer time to convince the public that it would benefit Hungary.&quot; According to Politico&apos;s sources, other countries, like Belgium, Slovenia, or Spain, are also averse to a quick invite for Ukraine but are less vocal about it, hiding in Berlin and Washington&apos;s shadow. &quot;Unfortunately, I think that the political support within NATO is not strong enough at this time,&quot; said James Goldgeier, a professor at the American University in Washington D.C. and an expert on NATO enlargement. Voicing skepticism about Biden actually changing his position, Goldgeier added: &quot;The biggest question is what approach would a Harris administration take if she were to win the election. I don&apos;t think we know that yet.&quot; Harris did not publicly commit to pushing Ukraine&apos;s NATO bid forward. Nor did her Republican challenger, Donald Trump, whose potential return to the White House prompts fears of the U.S. decreasing or canceling its support of Ukraine. Even if Kyiv manages to muster support among all 32 members, Zelensky acknowledged that the actual membership will have to wait until the end of the war. The military outcome of the full-scale war is unclear, but the current situation seems to favor Russia and makes it unlikely that Ukraine will be able to liberate all of its territories in the near future. While Ukraine&apos;s allies have publicly avowed commitment to its territorial integrity, the present situation led to some speculations about more &quot;realistic&quot; pathways toward NATO membership. Speaking to the Financial Times, former NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg proposed a &quot;West German solution,&quot; suggesting that the alliance&apos;s Article 5 could extend only to territories held by Kyiv. The areas occupied by Russia would be de facto left outside of the alliance without officially acknowledging them as Russian. Some media reports also suggested that some in the West are considering the possibility of Ukraine temporarily trading its territory for NATO membership. Talking to the Kyiv Independent, Grand said that while he fully supports Ukraine restoring its territorial integrity, &quot;full control over the entire territory should, however, not be a prerequisite for joining NATO.&quot; A soldier looks at a fire caused by artillery fire in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on July 29, 2024. (Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)The expert said that the West Germany solution &quot;proved a good decision for the Alliance, for Germany and for European security&quot; and &quot;some lessons of this experience could apply to Ukraine.&quot; Others, like historian Timothy Garton Ash, pointed out differences in the German and Ukrainian starting points. Unlike Russian-occupied Ukraine, East Germany was not being &quot;brutally Russified,&quot; he wrote in an op-ed in the Financial Times. Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center, said such a decision would not be the most &quot;favorable scenario,&quot; but it is not unfeasible if the allies provide enough military power to back it up. He also mollified fears that accepting Ukraine into NATO would automatically mandate the allies to put boots on the ground. Extending the invitation and accepting Ukraine would be powerful by itself as it would impose strategic uncertainty on the Kremlin: &quot;We don&apos;t have to (send our soldiers). But we have the right at any moment to do so.&quot; Indeed, Article 5 requires the allies merely to take &quot;such action as (they) deem necessary&quot; to safeguard collective security but does not dictate a full-blown military response. At least publicly, Kyiv has been adamant that it will not compromise on territory or sovereignty. Commenting on the possibility of entering NATO without occupied territories, Zelensky said that &quot;no matter what path we take, legally, no one will recognize the occupied territories as territories of other states.&quot; The Ukrainian president noted that he was not approached directly with the NATO-for-territory proposals but believes some partners are sending these signals through the media. &quot;I think that in this case, everything depends on Ukrainian society,&quot; Zelensky said. A survey conducted in May 2024 showed that 55% of Ukrainians opposed territorial concession. While still constituting a majority, it was a drop from 65% and 74% in February 2024 and December 2023. In the same poll, roughly half of the respondents were open to the possibility of Russia de facto holding on to some occupied territories if Ukraine can join NATO and gain real security guarantees. Ukrainian political analyst Mykola Davydiuk said that if NATO is actually considering the West German scenario, it needs to make the offer officially, but it must also understand how Russia would react to such a step.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hopes-washington-will-support-kyivs-nato-bid-after-elections-as-opposition-in-europe-persists/	2024-10-26T11:52:05-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2161663204-1.jpg
Both sides declare victory in Georgia's pivotal vote on European future	Competing exit polls indicate that Georgia&#x2019;s increasingly authoritarian ruling party, Georgian Dream, is positioned to lead in a crucial election on the nation&#x2019;s European future. However, the polls diverge on which side could secure a majority. The ruling Georgian Dream party, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, and opposition groups aiming to end the party&#x2019;s 12-year rule declared victory on Oct. 26. Opposition-aligned TV channels reported Georgian Dream with 40.9% of the vote, while the combined total for four opposition groups was at 51.9%. Meanwhile, the pro-government Imedi TV gave Georgian Dream a higher 56%. Under Georgia&#x2019;s updated electoral system, the party with at least half the vote claims half of the 150 seats in parliament. Although Georgia achieved EU candidate status last December, the European Union has since suspended the process due to &quot;democratic backsliding&quot; and the passage of a Russian-style &quot;foreign influence&quot; law targeting groups receiving Western funding. Election monitors reported various violations across the country, including ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. Less than an hour before polls closed, President Salome Zourabichvili, known for her pro-Western stance, urged opposition voters not to be intimidated. &quot;Don&apos;t get scared. All this is just psychological pressure on you,&quot; she said in a live address on social media. Large numbers of Georgians participated in the election on Oct. 26, despite reports of violence near polling stations. Two people were hospitalized, and Georgian Dream supporters attacked the headquarters of the main opposition party, BBC reported. In one incident, an opposition official south of Tbilisi told the BBC he was first assaulted by a local Georgian Dream council member and then by &quot;another 10 men came and I didn&#x2019;t know what was happening to me.&quot; The opposition has framed this high-stakes vote as a choice between Europe and Russia. Should the exit polls favoring the opposition prove accurate, they could end Georgian Dream&#x2019;s 12-year tenure. Final projected results are expected soon.	https://kyivindependent.com/both-sides-declare-victory-in-georgias-pivotal-vote-on-european-future/	2024-10-26T10:16:14-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2180410629.jpg
Final pre-election push to boost ‘heartland’ US support for Ukraine proves difficult	PARMA, Ohio &#x2014; After serving nearly three months in the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, a unit within the country&#x2019;s army comprised of fighters from abroad, Manus McCaffery is known as a hometown hero in Parma, Ohio, home to one of the largest diaspora communities in the U.S. with roots from Ukraine. Months into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in 2022, the now 23-year-old U.S. veteran was wounded in Ukraine&#x2019;s Zaporizhzhia Oblast. He dedicated the subsequent years to another way of supporting Ukraine &#x2013; by fundraising for its armed forces in Parma. As part of his mission to expand support for Ukraine among fellow Ohio conservatives, McCaffery joined a discussion organized by the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Parma this October, less than a month from the U.S. presidential election. The event was part of the fund&#x2019;s &#x201C;Whistlestops for Ukraine&#x201D; tour, a year-long effort to rally support for Kyiv. A Parma, Ohio veteran who served in Ukraine&#x2019;s foreign legion, Manus McCaffery (C) remains undecided on his vote for the U.S. president on Nov. 5. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)Yet even McCaffery himself is torn over how he will vote in the Nov. 5 election: for the status quo in terms of U.S. backing for Ukraine, namely President Joe Biden&apos;s Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic Party ticket, or Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has openly questioned further allyship with Kyiv and has a history of fancy for Russian President Vladimir Putin. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m extremely uncertain, it&#x2019;s tough because I want to balance what I think is best for America, but also, in a lot of ways, I&apos;m a one-issue person because I care about Ukraine so much,&#x201D; McCaffery told the Kyiv Independent. It would have been easier, he added, for him to vote for Biden over Harris, who he says is too progressive on domestic issues. The veteran of Ukraine and U.S. armed services said his vote would be a last-minute decision. With the U.S. presidential election days away and 40% of Trump supporters saying Washington should &#x201C;reconsider&#x201D; its level of backing for Ukraine, the Ohio stop showed how challenging the German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s mission of increasing support for Ukraine is. Since last November, the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based research group that promotes democracy, has visited eight &#x201C;heartland&#x201D; U.S. states in a public diplomacy initiative dubbed &#x201C;Whistlestops for Ukraine.&#x201D; The tour has primarily focused on Democratic city centers surrounded by conservative rural areas and ideologically diverse suburbs like Denver, Colorado, Des Moines, Iowa, and Erie, Pennsylvania. &#xA0; Heather Conley, a senior advisor to the German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s board who led the tour, described each stop on the tour as a &#x201C;unique set of conversations and meetings&#x201D; that involve outreach to community business leaders and farming communities. The tour had previously included the Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova. But as the topic of aid to Ukraine has become increasingly politicized in the past months, she was absent from the most recent stop in Ohio. &#xA0; Republican Mike Johnson, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a close Trump ally, openly called this autumn for Volodymyr Zelensky to fire Markarova after the Ukrainian president&#x2019;s recent visit to a Pennsylvania artillery ammunition factory producing weaponry for his armed forces. The state&#x2019;s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, attended the visit, but there was no representation from the Republican Party. &#xA0; Conley said Markarova wasn&#x2019;t part of the Ohio stop due to the sensitivity of Ukraine&#x2019;s topic so close to the U.S. election. &#x201C;After Zelensky&#x2019;s visit to the U.S., (the Ukrainian Embassy) wanted to be, understandably, more cautious,&#x201D; Conley said. The German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s last stop before the election and second to last overall comprised one day of engagements in northeast Ohio. Once a swing state, Ohio has reliably voted Republican since 2016. It is also home to the Republican party&#x2019;s Ukraine-skeptical vice presidential nominee JD Vance and nearly 12 million voters, offering a ripe electorate to expand conservative support of Ukraine. Around 60,000 Ukrainians live in the state, including nearly 10,000 who have relocated since Russis&#x2019;a full-scale invasion, according to Global Cleveland. The German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s Ohio visit included a tour of a Ukrainian daycare, a roundtable with local Ukrainian and religious leaders, and a conversation with local U.S. veterans. Flanked by the Democratic-leaning city of Cleveland to its north and rural Ohio to its south, the city hall of Parma, Ohio, has raised the Ukrainian flag since the early days of the full-scale invasion. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)Home to Ohio&#x2019;s largest Ukrainian population, Parma, Ohio has continuous reminders of its support from Ukrainian flag-painted fire hydrants to street posts. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)With the largest concentration of Ukrainians in northeast Ohio, the whistlestop had no problem finding passionate defenders of Ukraine&#x2019;s sovereignty. However, some attendees said many voters in Parma are hesitant to support Ukraine. One Parma resident, who is known locally for being an outspoken Republican for Ukraine, said he will &#x201C;begrudgingly have to vote for Trump&#x201D; because of the economy, despite believing &#x201C;Ukraine is screwed with a Trump administration.&#x201D; The Republican voter, who like others spoke to the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity for privacy concerns, said his support of Ukraine&#x2019;s independence is a conflicting issue for his vote, as he wishes a pro-Ukraine Republican like Nikki Haley, the Trump&#x2019;s former ambassador to the United Nations, was on the ticket. Trump has repeatedly claimed he would end Russia&#x2019;s war in 24 hours, without going into details about how he is planning to achieve that. Due to his consistent criticism of U.S. aid to Ukraine and friendly ties with the Kremlin, many fear that Trump&#x2019;s plan may involve forcing Ukraine to make territorial concessions and agree to a peace deal on unfair terms. Yet even some Ukrainians in Parma appear to have bought into Trump&#x2019;s message that he will end the war immediately should he be elected in November, earning the 78-year-old their vote. &#x201C;I talk to a lot of Ukrainians who support Trump and it almost feels like there is a bit of cognitive dissonance because they support Ukraine but they also support Trump,&#x201D; said Andriy Boechko, a Parma resident who moved from Lviv, western Ukraine, in the 1990s. Students of Parma, Ohio&#x2019;s Ukrainian Academy performed for community members as the German Marshall Fund concluded their &#x2018;Whistlestops for Ukraine&#x2019; visit in Ohio.

(Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)Parma, Ohio&#x2019;s St. Vladimir Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral sits along a street of businesses with signs indicating their support of Ukraine. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The 37-year-old registered independent says he&#x2019;ll vote for Harris as he believes Ukraine will be better off with her in office than Trump. &#x201C;I like to keep an open mind, but I&#x2019;m not a Trump supporter, definitely not, especially as far as Ukraine is concerned, I&#x2019;m a little worried about what&#x2019;s going to happen if he&#x2019;s elected,&#x201D; Boechko said. &#x201C;The most important issue is foreign policy, and I think Democrats have a better grasp on that.&#x201D; Like in other states across the U.S. that benefit from aid for Ukraine, the connection between the Biden Administration&#x2019;s foreign policy and local economic growth along with new jobs doesn&#x2019;t seem evident in Ohio. Of the $175 billion Congress has allocated for Kyiv since 2022, nearly $70 billion was poured into American manufacturing in over 70 U.S. cities, according to one analysis. Over $700 million of that sum was spent on the manufacturing economy of Ohio. Dozens of Stryker combat vehicles and M1 Abrams tanks have rolled off an Army-owned General Dynamics production line in Lima, Ohio before being sent to Kyiv. Ukraine has also received Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) produced by General Dynamics in Springboro, Ohio. Despite that, Lima&#x2019;s Republican representative, Jim Jordan, like Trump&#x2019;s running mate Vance, opposes aid to Ukraine. According to Boechko, the Biden Administration could expand voters&#x2019; support of Ukraine if they better communicated that not all of the money the U.S. spends on aiding Ukraine goes directly to Ukraine. Parma&#x2019;s Democratic Mayor, Tim DeGeeter, argued that the middle of the country doesn&#x2019;t trust Washington during an election season. DeGeeter, who boasts a Ukrainian flag outside city hall, asked Conley of the German Marshall Fund to help get the message out to Ohioans that supporting Ukraine is an American boon. &#x201C;Even though that war is 5,000 plus miles away, it&apos;s very close to all for us here in Parma,&#x201D; DeGeeter said. Heather Conley, the German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s senior advisor to the board, led the democracy-promoting groups&apos; Parma, Ohio visit in October 2024. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)Situated alongside local veterans, Parma&#x2019;s Democratic state representative, Sean Brennan, left, engaged in multiple sessions of the German Marshall Fund&#x2019;s stop in Parma. (Owen Racer/The Kyiv Independent)The German Marshall Fund observed a similar lack of understanding of how aid for Ukraine benefits American communities during one of their previous stops in Erie, Pennsylvania. Erie is home to Vorex LLC and Logistics Plus, which have been expanding the local manufacturing economy by providing Ukraine with bulletproof vests and generators, respectively. According to Conley, Erie&apos;s businesses are &#x201C;critical players in America&apos;s support for Ukraine.&#x201D; The fund&#x2019;s events in Erie in May mostly attracted voters who already supported Ukraine, according to attendee Ashley Lawson, who has helped settle hundreds of Ukrainians in northwest Pennsylvania as a field director with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. &#x201C;Erie is a perfect example of a city that is critical to U.S. foreign and security policy every day &#x2014; they just might not realize it,&#x201D; Conley said. Meanwhile, in Ohio, Parma Mayor DeGeeter remains hopeful the large Ukrainian population will turn out in opposition to the Republican party, which has dominated most Ohio counties excluding those home to major metropolitan areas. &#xA0; &#x201C;The alternative (to a Harris White House), candidate Trump, is basically saying &#x2018;give up land and territory, that&#x2019;s how we can end this war,&#x2019;&#x201D; DeGeeter said. &#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s kind of the goal of Putin, that&#x2019;s not a shared objective.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/in-ohio-final-push-to-increase-us-support-of-ukraine-proves-difficult-as-election-nears/	2024-10-26T08:07:42-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173511741.jpg
Polling station closed in southern Georgia during election following reported ballot stuffing	Georgia&apos;s Central Election Commisssion closed a polling station on Oct. 26 in the southern city of Marneuli after video footage of ballot stuffing during the parliamentary election surfaced. The Interior Ministry has also launched an investigation into the incident, Georgia media outlet SOVA reported. The investigation has been launched under Article 164 of Georgia&apos;s criminal code, concerning the &quot;falsification of elections, which provides for the deliberate falsification of election documents: voter lists, protocols, ballots, registration logs and control sheets and is punishable by up to two years of imprisonment.&quot; Nino Lomjaria, a Georgian lawyer and former ombudswoman, reported earlier on Oct. 26 that an election observer was attacked while filming a ballot box being stuffed. Giorgi Kalandarishvili, chairperson of Georgia&apos;s Central Election Committe, called the video &quot;disturbing,&quot; and said that &quot;if confirmed, the election administration will not allow such managed or manipulative incidents to undermine the many months of effort we have put into election day.&quot; Parliamentary elections in Georgia are underway on Oct. 26 which will determine if the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party will remain in power. Concerns about Georgia&apos;s democracy have reached a fever pitch after the ruling Georgian Dream party passed the foreign agents law, which requires organizations that receive foreign funding to be labeled as &quot;foreign agents&quot; and mirrors repressive Russian legislation used to crack down on Kremlin regime critics. On Sept. 14, the de facto leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, as part of his party&apos;s larger trend of rapprochement with Russia declared that Georgia should &quot;apologize&quot; for Russia&apos;s 2008 war against the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/polling-station-closed-in-southern-georgia-during-election-following-reported-ballot-stuffing/	2024-10-26T06:33:11-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2151494694.jpg
Government says 'strategically important' employees will be able to extend military exemption status	Employees in &quot;strategically important sectors of the economy&quot; will be able to extend their exemption from military conscription, Ukraine&apos;s Cabinet of Ministers announced on Oct. 26. Meanwhile, an audit of the exemption process is ongoing until Nov. 15 to assess which businesses qualify for critical enterprise status, reflecting the government&apos;s effort to balance the country&apos;s defense needs with economic stability. &quot;The reason for the audit is the abnormal increase in the number of critical enterprises and the number of reserved employees. This is done in the interest of strengthening the country&apos;s defense capability and preventing abuses,&quot; the Cabinet of Ministers said. Nearly one million people were eligible for exemption in mid-August, according to the Defense Ministry. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said in early April that he ordered relevant ministries to introduce &quot;updated, more fair&quot; rules on exempting employees of &quot;critically important&quot; companies from military service. Ukraine has been struggling to mobilize enough soldiers for the front line to compensate for troop casualties and the need to rotate soldiers who have been fighting since the onset of the full-scale war. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April in order to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. Leading up to the passing of the law, Ukraine launched Reserv+, which the government promoted as a convenient alternative to lengthy waits at enlistment offices. Another law, signed by President Volodymyr Zelensky just before the mobilization law was passed, lowered the minimum age of compulsory military service from 27 to 25. In late 2023, Zelensky said that the military, then under General Valery Zaluzhnyi&apos;s command, requested drafting 450,000-500,000 people in the face of a prolonged war. Zaluzhyni later denied this figure.	https://kyivindependent.com/government-says-strategically-important-employees-will-be-able-to-extend-military-exemption-status/	2024-10-26T06:08:53-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
Georgians head out to vote in parliamentary elections, tensions run high at some polling stations	Parliamentary elections in Georgia are underway on Oct. 26 which will determine if the Moscow-friendly Georgian Dream party will remain in power. A large rally with tens of thousands of Georgians in support of the country&apos;s accession to the European Union was held in Tbilisi&apos;s Freedom Square on Oct. 20 ahead of the vote. Georgia received EU candidate status alongside Ukraine in December 2023, but questions surrounding Georgia&apos;s candidacy continue to swirl as the ruling Georgian Dream party continues to rekindle relations with Russia. Tensions are reportedly running high at some polling stations in the country. Nino Lomjaria, a lawyer and former ombudswoman, reported on Oct. 26 that an election observer was attacked while filming a ballot box being stuffed. Giorgi Kalandarishvili, chairperson of Georgia&apos;s Central Election Committe, called the video &quot;disturbing,&quot; and said that &quot;if confirmed, the election administration will not allow such managed or manipulative incidents to undermine the many months of effort we have put into election day,&quot; Georgian public media reported.

Western officials have sanctioned in recent months Georgian officials who they deem as having a role in committing human rights abuses. Moscow formally initiated processes cozying relations with Tbilisi on Oct. 10 as Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree expanding visa-free entry for Georgian citizens who are working or studying in Russia. Fears of Russian interference also ran high during the recent Moldovan election, with the vote for the EU referendum winning by only 11,000 votes despite polls showing clear support for closer ties to Europe. Moldovan authorities revealed that they had evidence of other 130,000 people receiving bribes from Russian-linked forces to influence the referendum vote. The second round of voting, which will see if President Maia Sandu will hold onto the presidency, is set to take place on Nov. 3.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgians-head-out-to-vote-in-parliamentary-elections-tensions-run-high-at-some-polling-stations/	2024-10-26T05:05:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2147848892.jpg
Media: US-sanctioned Gazprombank may buy Auchan chains in Russia	Gazprombank, one of Russia&apos;s largest banks that is also under heavy U.S. sanctions, is reportedly poised to acquire the Russian operations of the Auchan retail chain, according to sources cited by Le Monde on Oct. 25. Auchan, a French hypermarket chain, remains one of the last Western businesses operating in Russia after many companies exited the market following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia reportedly accounted for 10% of Auchan&apos;s global sales. Auchan CEO Yves Claude noted that 30,000 people, including 40% of employees and shareholders, could lose their jobs if the company exited the market. In March 2022, Auchan CEO Yves Claude told the outlet Journal du Dimanche that the company would not leave Russia despite accusations of financing the war, citing the need to keep employees and continue &quot;feeding the populations of both Ukraine and Russia.&quot; Yet, French media reported on Oct. 24 that Auchan was in the final negotiations to sell its Russian subsidiary to a local buyer and is expected to finalize the sale in the coming weeks. The potential buyer was not named in the previous reporting, only that Auchan was reportedly eager to sell as Russia&apos;s &quot;exit tax&quot; has increased from 10% to 15%, with the potential to reach 35%. As Le Monde noted, Gazprombank purchased the Mega shopping center chain from Ikea, which included 14 locations &#xA0;across Russian, and housed Auchan stores. Gazprombank has been under U.S. sanctions since 2014, with additional sanctions announced by the U.S. and U.K. in 2022 following the onset of the full-scale war. In January 2023, Russian state-controlled media announced that U.S. banks stopped dollar transfers for Gazprombank.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-gazprombank-may-buy-auchan-chains-in-russia/	2024-10-26T01:46:22-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1239550139.jpg

G7 to provide Ukraine $50 billion in loans backed by frozen Russian assets	The Group of Seven (G7) has reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets, the G7 announced on Oct. 25. &quot;Our aim is to begin disbursing the funds by the end of the year,&quot; a statement from the G7 leaders read. During the G7 summit in Italy in June, G7 leaders publicly confirmed an agreement on the plan to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan. Officials said shortly thereafter that the plan would be finalized in October. &quot;Today, we, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), have reached a consensus on how to deliver approximately $50 billion in Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loans to Ukraine,&quot; the Oct. 25 statement reads. &quot;These loans will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian Sovereign Assets, in line with G7 respective legal systems and international law. &quot; The funds will support Ukraine&apos;s economic, defense, and reconstruction needs. While Western countries have frozen $300 billion in Russian assets, they can only access the annual income generated by these funds, approximately $3.2 billion. These profits will back the $50-billion loan to Kyiv, while the vast majority of the assets are frozen in European countries. Speaking at the G7 summit in June, President Volodymyr Zelensky called on G7 leaders to back the $50-billion plan but also urged the creation of a mechanism for the full confiscation of $300 billion in frozen Russian funds. According to media reports on Oct. 22, the G7 plans to keep the Russian assets immobilized even after the war against Ukraine ends.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-to-provide-ukraine-50-billion-in-loans-backed-by-frozen-russian-assets/	2024-10-25T19:08:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Satellite images show expansion at Soviet-era bioweapons lab in Russia	Satellite imagery shows signs of a major renovation and expansion at a restricted military facility near Moscow that once housed a Cold War biological weapons program, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Oct. 25. Sergiyev Posad-6, a military site northeast of Moscow, was a Soviet biological weapons research center during the Cold War. The Soviet military used the lab to experiment with weaponizing the viruses that cause smallpox and Ebola, among others. Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, satellite imagery indicated massive construction and renovation at the Sergiyev Posad-6 site, the WP reported, citing photos from imaging firms Planet Labs and Maxar. The expansion amounts to over 250,000 square feet and 10 new buildings. According to experts in biodefense, the military, and satellite imaging who spoke to the WP, the facilities harbor some of the distinctive features of high-security biological labs that handle dangerous pathogens. Among these features are extensive rooftop air handling units, underground infrastructure, heightened security, and a possible power plant. The layout is &quot;consistent with lab design&quot; and suggests &quot;maximum containment&quot; labs, one expert said. &quot;The upgrades are consistent with this secure, top-secret military biological facility&apos;s historic role in developing viral biological weapons,&quot; said Andrew Weber, a former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Council on Strategic Risks. Russian officials have said that the purpose of the labs is to study Ebola viruses and other deadly microbes in order to protect Russia from possible bioterrorism. The expansion at Sergiyev Posad-6 coincides with a Russian disinformation campaign in the early months of the full-scale invasion, when the Kremlin falsely accused Ukraine of developing biological weapons. Officials told the WP that it is impossible to tell from the satellite photos whether Russia plans to use the Sergiyev Posad-6 labs to research and develop biological weapons. Biological warfare is banned under international law. While there is no evidence Russia has used such weapons in its war against Ukraine, Kyiv has accused Moscow of launching thousands of chemical weapons attacks during its ongoing invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also repeatedly resorted to nuclear blackmail to deter Ukraine&apos;s Western allies from a more aggressive response.	https://kyivindependent.com/satellite-images-show-expansion-at-soviet-era-bioweapons-lab-in-russia/	2024-10-25T18:31:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-695215514.jpg
US reports North Korean troops moving to Russia’s Kursk region	The Biden administration believes that a contingent of North Korean troops is en route to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region to assist Moscow in countering a Ukrainian offensive launched there in August, according to a U.S. official. Although U.S. officials have not confirmed South Korean reports that North Korean soldiers will engage in direct combat, they estimate the North Korean force could number in the thousands and may rapidly be assigned to combat roles, the Wall Street Journal reports. The U.S. official&#x2019;s remarks followed National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby&#x2019;s statement earlier on Oct. 25, where he noted that some North Korean troops stationed at multiple training sites in eastern Russia will likely be deployed to Kursk, though the specific purpose remains unclear. &quot;...At least some of these North Korean troops could be deployed to the Kursk area,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;But in what capacity, for what purpose, that still remains unclear.&quot; This marks the first public acknowledgment by the U.S. of its assessment that North Korean troops could soon be in Kursk, coming a day after Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence reported that the initial units trained in Russia had already moved to the region. Initially, U.S. officials estimated around 3,000 North Korean troops were training in Russia, but Kirby indicated that the overall count could now be higher. South Korean intelligence has informed lawmakers that North Korean troop numbers in Russia could reach 10,000 by December.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-reports-north-korean-troops-moving-to-russias-kursk-region/	2024-10-25T16:58:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157772464.jpg
Russian missile attack kills 3, injures 14 in Dnipro	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian missile attack struck several residential buildings and a medical facility in the central-eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro late on Oct. 25, killing three people and injuring at least 14, according to regional governor Serhii Lysak. Lysak reported that the attack left four children injured, including an eight-year-old girl and a teenage boy. One child is in critical condition. First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack as some people might be trapped under the rubble, according to Lysak. Local news sources indicated that several strikes targeted different areas across the city. No other details were provided at the moment. Dnipro, Ukraine&apos;s fourth-largest city with a pre-war population of about one million, has served as a key logistics and humanitarian hub during the full-scale war. It is located approximately 395 kilometers (245 miles) from Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-missile-attack-kills-3-injures-13-in-dnipro/	2024-10-25T15:40:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-25-16_36_53.jpeg
North Korea says any troop deployment to Russia is in 'regulations of international law'	North Korea&#x2019;s foreign ministry said on Oct. 25 that any decision to send its troops to support Russia in the war in Ukraine would comply with international law, however, it did not confirm whether such a deployment had occurred. Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jong Gyu, in a statement shared by state news agency KCNA, remarked that if North Korea had taken such actions, they would align with international norms despite attempts by others to portray them as illegal. Russian President Vladimir Putin refrained from denying the reports, which have circulated from sources in Ukraine, South Korea, the United States, and other nations. Kyiv stresses that any North Korean involvement in Russia&apos;s war could amount to a crime of aggression under international law. Kim Jong Gyu noted that the foreign ministry does not oversee military matters, leaving such issues to the defense ministry and, therefore, refraining from specific comments on deployment. &quot;If there is such a thing that the world media is talking about, I think it will be an act conforming with the regulations of international law,&quot; he added. North Korea and Russia have strengthened ties since the war began, including signing a new mutual defense pact. Ukraine and Western governments have previously accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia&#x2014;allegations both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied. President Volodymyr Zelensky, referencing intelligence reports, said that Russia intends to deploy North Korean troops to the battlefield in the coming days. Ukrainian military intelligence reported on Oct. 24 that approximately 12,000 North Korean troops, including 500 officers and three generals, were already in Russia and undergoing training at five military bases. The United States has also indicated seeing evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, while South Korean lawmakers estimate around 3,000 soldiers have already been sent, with more expected.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-says-any-troop-deployment-to-russia-is-in-regulations-of-international-law/	2024-10-25T14:05:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179013028.jpg
Usyk appeals to Trump to help free Azovstal defenders from Russian captivity	Ukrainian world boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk called on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Oct. 25 to influence Russian President Vladimir Putin to release the defenders of the Azovstal steel plant. The POWs, made up of the Azov regiment among soldiers from other units, became a symbol of Ukraine&apos;s resistance through their tenacious defense of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol in the first three months of the all-out war. Russian forces eventually took Mariupol in May 2022, capturing the remaining defenders after Kyiv gave an order to preserve their lives. About 700 Azov fighters remain in Russian captivity, Olena Tolkachova, the head of the patronage service of the Azov Brigade, said on national television in September. Trump will be a guest on one of internet personality Joe Rogan&apos;s upcoming podcast episodes, hence, Usyk asked the American podcaster to pass on his appeal to the former U.S. president and Republican presidential nominee. &quot;If Mr. President is so confident in his influence over Putin, could he help free Azovstal defenders and all Ukrainians from Russian captivity right away? Time is of the essence,&quot; Usyk wrote on X. Earlier, Trump said that during his presidency, he &quot;(got) along very well with Putin,&quot; implying that the Russian leader often talked about his ambition to control Ukraine. The comments came two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, which is expected to decisively shape Washington&apos;s support for Ukraine&apos;s struggle against Russian aggression. Trump has often claimed he would end Russia&apos;s war within &quot;24 hours&quot; without elaborating on how he plans to achieve it. Some reports and statements from Trump&apos;s inner circle indicate this might entail pressuring Ukraine to cede territory or give up on its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/usyk-appeals-to-trump-to-help-free-azovstal-defenders-from-russian-captivity/	2024-10-25T12:05:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2153592894.jpg
Russian drone hits multi-story residential building in Kyiv	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A Russian suicide drone hit a multi-story residential building in Kyiv&apos;s Solomianskyi district on Oct. 25, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. An air alert sounded in Kyiv and several other oblasts of Ukraine around 9 p.m. local time due to a mass Russian drone attack, which have been a near daily occurrence in Ukraine for over a month. Some 30 minutes later, explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital. A fire broke out on the upper floors of a residential building due to a Russian drone strike, Klitschko said. Emergency services went to the scene of impact.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-drone-hits-multi-story-residential-building-in-kyiv/	2024-10-25T11:45:27-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1489471985.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia to deploy North Korean troops to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, Kyiv says	Key developments on Oct. 25: Russia is planning to send first North Korean soldiers to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports. Speaking after a regular meeting meeting with his top military and civilian officials, Zelensky called the move an &quot;obvious step toward escalation&quot; that stands in contrast to &quot;disinformation we heard from the Kremlin in recent days.&quot; &quot;The world can clearly see what Russia really wants, and that is to continue the war. That is why we need a principled and strong reaction from the world&apos;s leaders,&quot; Zelensky said. The president called on the West to put &quot;tangible pressure&quot; on both Moscow and Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Charter and punish escalation. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. Zelensky also said after the meeting that Ukraine had established a buffer zone in Kursk Oblast that prevents Russia from expanding the war to further Ukrainian territories in the east. Following multiple reports by Ukraine and South Korea, the U.S. acknowledged that North Korean troops were arriving in Russia. &quot;What exactly they are doing remains to be seen,&quot; said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, leaving room for doubt. In return for the transfer of soldiers and arms, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov. Ukrainian forces have killed, injured, or captured 17,819 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast since the first days of Kyiv&apos;s incursion, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed on Oct. 25. According to the general, a total of 6,662 Russian troops have been killed, 10,446 wounded, and 711 captured since Aug. 8. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. Syrskyi refuted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s claims made during the BRICS summit in Kazan on Oct. 24 that about 2,000 Ukrainian troops were cut off in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This is outright disinformation that does not reflect the real situation,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;Ukrainian troops continue active operations in the Kursk direction, destroying the enemy&apos;s combat potential for the third month in a row.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The reports came days after the first North Korean soldiers had been reportedly deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia was planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28. Any peace agreement to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine must be in Moscow&apos;s favor, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with state media on Oct. 25. Ahead of Ukraine&apos;s first peace summit in June, Putin had outlined conditions for negotiations, which included Kyiv&apos;s surrender of the four oblasts illegally claimed by Moscow in September 2022. Russia has since said it will not engage in talks as long as Ukrainian forces remain in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Any outcome must be in Russia&apos;s favor, I say directly, without any embarrassment, and must be based on the realities on the battlefield. And without any doubt, we are not going to make any concessions here; there will be no swaps,&quot; Putin said. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In comments to Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot; Moscow was not invited to the June summit in Switzerland, attended by over 90 countries, dismissing the discussions as irrelevant without its involvement. Following the event, Zelensky expressed hope for a follow-up meeting by the end of the year, with the goal of including Russia. Yet, Moscow announced it would not participate in any future iterations of the Swiss-hosted peace summit, labeling the process a &quot;fraud.&quot; Polish President Andrzej Duda denied the possibility of transferring to Kyiv weapons systems Warsaw purchased from South Korea, Polish media RMF24 reported on Oct. 25. South Korean law prohibits the exporting of weapons to active conflict zones, but Seoul has repeatedly hinted that this could change in light of deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Duda said he had talked to Kyiv about the possible transfer of South Korean weapons but that his response to the allies was &quot;unequivocal.&quot; &quot;There is no scenario in which we hand over weapons that we have recently bought for billions of zlotys from the pockets of our taxpayers. These weapons must serve the security and defense of the Republic of Poland,&quot; Duda said during his visit to South Korea. If Seoul agrees to supply Ukraine with weapons, it will not be from the stockpile intended for Poland, Duda added. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25 that Russia is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28. In return for the transfer of soldiers and arms, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov. Ukrainian forces destroyed radar guidance equipment of a Buk-M2 air defense system and struck a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 25 in the occupied part of Luhansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces and other military units. The General Staff did not elaborate on other possible damage apart from the destroyed guidance system. The Russian targets were hit &quot;several dozens of kilometers behind the front line,&quot; the statement read. Buk is a family of self-propelled, medium-range air defense systems developed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union. The Buk-M2 and M3 are modernized variants, capable of shooting down aerial targets like tactical ballistic missiles at a range of 50 and 65 kilometers, respectively (30 and 40 miles). Russian proxy forces used a Buk missile to shoot down the MH17 Malaysian airliner over Donetsk Oblast on July 17, 2014, in the early months of the Donbas War. Ukraine previously destroyed a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 21, the military said. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 982 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-combat-zone-on-oct-27-28-kyiv-says/	2024-10-25T11:28:31-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1154567149.jpg
Russian troop losses for October could hit 40,000, Estonian intelligence suggests	Russian troop casualties over October may reach around 40,000 troops, Janek Kesselmann, the deputy commander of the Estonian Military Intelligence Center, said on Oct. 25. Ukraine&apos;s General Staff reported on Oct. 25 that Russian forces had suffered 1,630 casualties over the past day, surpassing the previous second-highest tally of 1,530, which was set on Oct. 18. &quot;Russia&apos;s losses are quite high. And this month seems to be one of the biggest in terms of losses for Russia,&quot; Kesselmann told Estonian media EER. Russian troops continue to advance along the entire front line, made possible by constant shelling and so-called human wave infantry attacks, Kesselmann added. Russian attacks are currently most concentrated around Zelene and Kurakhove in the Pokrovsk sector of Donetsk Oblast. Meanwhile, Russian tactics have shifted recently to not entering the settlements, as this requires more &quot;sophisticated&quot; preparation, according to Estonian intelligence. &quot;Therefore, they besiege settlements with indirect fire. After the settlement is surrounded, they simply destroy it. It is a very cynical and disgusting thing,&quot; Kesselmann said. Russian troops have also advanced in the area of Chasiv Yar and the Lyman sector of the front line in Donetsk Oblast. In Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, there were no significant changes in the territories controlled by Ukrainian troops over the past week, Estonian intelligence said. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. The first Noth Korean soldiers are to be deployed to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28, according to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-may-lose-nearly-40-000-personnel-in-war-with-ukraine-in-october-estonian-intelligence-suggests/	2024-10-25T11:09:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/gettyimages-1241864963-16583266909s1o2.jpg
Translator planned to be assigned to every 30 North Korean soldiers, Ukraine's military intelligence says	Russia plans to assign one interpreter to every 30 North Korean soldiers for better coordination with Russian troops on the battlefield, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency reported on Oct. 25, citing an intercepted conversation between service members of a Russian brigade in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, to participate in the war against Ukraine, according to military intelligence. The first sightings of North Korean soldiers on a base in Russia were recorded on Oct. 23. Moscow is planning to send the first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. In the intercepted conversations, the Russian military refers to the North Korean soldiers as &quot;K Battalion,&quot; according to HUR. Apart from an interpreter, three Russian soldiers will be assigned to every group of 30 North Korean fighters. Yes, there are doubts in the Russian army about the possibility of carrying this out in practice. North Korea has denied reports of its troops&apos; presence in Russia, while a Kremlin spokesperson provided an evasive response. A military intelligence source told the Kyiv Independent on Oct. 21 that Russian authorities detained 18 North Korean soldiers who abandoned their positions in Kursk Oblast. Video footage has also emerged, allegedly showing North Korean troops at a Russian military training camp. South Korean media reported on Oct. 22 that Pyongyang had dispatched pilots capable of flying Russian warplanes to join the conflict in Ukraine. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap agency also stated that South Korea is considering sending personnel to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/translator-planned-to-be-assigned-to-every-30-north-korean-soldiers-ukraines-military-intelligence-says/	2024-10-25T09:32:36-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-492165484.jpg

Rheinmetall provides Ukraine with 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles	German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall sent 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine at the end of the third quarter of 2024, the company announced on Oct. 25. Rheinmetall has so far transferred about 200 combat vehicles, including over a hundred Marder 1A3 models, to Ukraine directly or indirectly through the so-called circular exchange program. The German manufacturer first received an order for the Marder infantry fighting vehicles in March 2023. The recent batch of 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles provided to Ukraine was ordered by the German government and financed in the &quot;mid-double-digit million euros,&quot; according to the statement. Rheinmetall&apos;s Marder 1A3, which Ukraine is receiving, is equipped with additional laser rangefinders for efficient and precise target engagement. The agreement also provides for the delivery of a double-digit number of other pieces of equipment, including Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Leopard tanks, Rheinmetall said. In late July, Rheinmetall announced that it had received an order from the Ukrainian government to begin the construction of an ammunition factory in Ukraine. The company previously said it planned to open at least four production plants in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/rheinmetall-provides-ukraine-with-20-marder-infantry-fighting-vehicles/	2024-10-25T07:16:33-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/marder.jpg
Zelensky rejects UN secretary-general's visit over Russia trip, presidential source tells AFP	President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres&apos;s visit to Ukraine due to his participation in a summit in Russia, AFP reported on Oct. 25, citing an unnamed high-ranking source close to the Presidential Office. The Kyiv Independent reached out for comment to the Presidential Office but has not received an answer at the time of publication. Guterres attended the BRICS summit hosted in Kazan on Oct. 23-24, despite Ukraine&apos;s criticism. The U.N. secretary-general did not visit the global peace summit in Switzerland at Kyiv&apos;s invitation in the summer. &quot;After Kazan, (Guterres) wanted to come to Ukraine, but the president did not confirm his visit. So Guterres won&apos;t be here, specifically because of the humiliation of sanity and international law in Kazan,&quot; the source told AFP. In Kazan, Guterres met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The photo of their handshake was blasted by Ukrainians and some Western officials on social media. The U.N. secretary&apos;s visit came as North Korean troops are reportedly being deployed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast and are expected to be sent to fight in Ukraine. Guterres reiterated to Putin that Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine violated the U.N. charter and international law, according to a U.N. statement issued after their meeting. &quot;Although even some of its functionaries prefer the temptations in Kazan to the content of the U.N. Charter, our world is built in such a way that the rights of nations and the norms of international law matter and will matter,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 24, without naming Guterres. Guterres&apos;s visit to Ukraine was not previously announced. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other leaders, also arrived at the summit. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has canceled the trip after suffering a head injury at home.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-reportedly-rejects-un-secretarys-visit-to-ukraine-due-to-his-kazan-summit-participation/	2024-10-25T06:58:50-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179912953-1.jpg
For 2nd time in October, Russia suffers 2nd deadliest day since start of full-scale invasion, Ukraine claims	For the second time this month, Russian forces have suffered their second deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to figures released by Kyiv. The General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces on Oct. 25 reported 1,630 Russian casualties over the past day, surpassing the previous second-highest tally of 1,530, which was set just last week. The bloodiest day for Moscow&apos;s forces was on May 13, when they suffered a reported 1,740 casualties. The figures, which the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify, &#xA0;do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. Facing a shortage of manpower and a pressing need to maintain the grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, Russia has reportedly been throwing some of its most skilled troops into mass infantry attacks, and at very high costs. &quot;The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,&quot; according to a U.K. military intelligence report on Sept. 23. According to some experts, the surge in losses in recent months may be one of the factors behind the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia. &quot;The disclosure that North Korean troops may appear on the front line is a direct consequence of catastrophic Russian casualties,&quot; John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent last week. &quot;Their military effectiveness is questionable and they will be cannon fodder for Ukrainian defenders.&quot; The Netherlands, on Oct. 25, became the latest country to confirm the deployment of North Korean troops, claiming at least 1,500 are to be stationed in Kursk Oblast where Ukraine still holds sizable territory after an incursion launched in August. &quot;We expect the troops will mainly be deployed in Kursk and consist of mainly special units from the North Korean army,&quot; Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in comments reported by Reuters. He added that Russia is likely testing the troops and gauging international reaction. The U.S. on Oct. 23 made its first public confirmation that it had evidence of Pyongyang&apos;s soldiers being sent to Russia, following previous reports from Ukraine and South Korea.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby later said they were &quot;fair game&quot; for Ukrainian forces. &quot;If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they&apos;re fair game, they&apos;re fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they&apos;re defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&quot; Kirby told a press briefing at the White House. &quot;And so the possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers&#x2026; is absolutely real if they get deployed.&quot; Kirby also revealed details of U.S. intelligence assessments, saying Washington believes North Korea &quot;moved at least 3000 soldiers into eastern Russia.&quot; &quot;We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;These soldiers then traveled onward to multiple Russian military training sites in eastern Russia where they are currently undergoing training.&quot; Kirby said it was too early to say for sure if they &quot;will enter into combat alongside the Russian military,&quot; but added it was a &quot;highly concerning probability.&quot; In comments to Russian state TV on Oct. 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin said using North Korea&apos;s troops in its war in Ukraine was &quot;our business,&quot; and that if Kyiv wanted to join NATO then Moscow would do what it had to ensure its security. &quot;The sooner they realize the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it,&quot; he added in reference to the deployment of North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/for-2nd-time-in-october-russia-suffers-2nd-deadliest-day-since-start-of-full-scale-invasion-ukraine-claims/	2024-10-25T05:57:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1958294777.jpg
Our business' if we deploy North Korean troops, Putin says	Any possible deployment of North Korean troops to aid Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine would be a &quot;sovereign decision&quot; by Moscow and Pyongyang, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with state media on Oct. 25. Speaking to Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, Putin did not explicitly confirm the dispatch of North Korean soldiers, saying that &quot;once it&apos;s necessary to make a decision, we will do so.&quot; When foreign journalists asked Putin about the matter at the BRICS summit on Oct. 24, he said that the Russia-North Korea defense treaty provides for such a step. Asked about satellite images provided by South Korean intelligence, allegedly showing North Korean soldiers heading to Russia, Putin replied, &quot;Images are a serious thing; if there are images, they reflect something.&quot; The comments were seen as the first indirect admission by Russia about the deployment of North Korean troops, which has already been confirmed by Ukraine, South Korea, the U.S., and others. Pyongyang has dismissed the reports as &quot;groundless rumors.&quot; Downplaying his statements at the BRICS summit, Putin nevertheless reiterated in the interview with Skabeyeva that Article 4 of the treaty enables the deployment of troops. &quot;What we will do with this article, that is still a question,&quot; the Russian president said. &quot;But I want to say that this is our sovereign decision. Whether we use it or not, where, how, or whether we engage in exercises, training, or transfer some experience. It&apos;s our business.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first Noth Korean soldiers are to be deployed to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, according to Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-north-korean-troops/	2024-10-25T05:11:35-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157679114.jpg
Russia has suffered 17,800 casualties since start of Kursk incursion, Syrskyi claims	Ukrainian forces have killed, injured, or captured 17,819 Russian soldiers in Kursk Oblast since the first days of Kyiv&apos;s incursion, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi claimed on Oct. 25. According to the general, a total of 6,662 Russian troops have been killed, 10,446 wounded, and 711 captured since Aug. 8. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6, claiming to initially seize some 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) but recently facing mounting pressure as Russia pulls in reinforcements. Syrskyi refuted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s claims made during the BRICS summit in Kazan on Oct. 24 that about 2,000 Ukrainian troops were cut off in Kursk Oblast. &quot;This is outright disinformation that does not reflect the real situation,&quot; Syrskyi said. &quot;Ukrainian troops continue active operations in the Kursk direction, destroying the enemy&apos;s combat potential for the third month in a row.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The reports came days after the first North Korean soldiers had been reportedly deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia was planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-casualties-in-kursk/	2024-10-25T04:38:29-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lukashenko to reelect himself in January as regime prepares for elections	Belarus schedules next presidential election for January 2025. Belarus reportedly shoots down the second Russian drone amid ongoing incursions into its airspace. The EU supports Poland&#x2019;s migration plan, including suspended right to asylum amid the continued artificial migration crisis at the Belarus border. Russia&#x2019;s ambassador claims Moscow would help Minsk quash &#x2018;attempts to destabilize&#x2019; the country in the upcoming 2025 presidential elections. Belarus detains journalist Ihar Ilyash, husband of imprisoned reporter Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, who stayed in the country despite looming threat. Viasna claims 26 former political prisoners in Belarus face trials in October, with their sentences increased, reflecting a troubling trend of escalating political repression. Belarus has scheduled its next presidential election for Jan. 26, 2025, the country&#x2019;s Central Electoral Commission announced on Oct. 23. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is widely expected to hold on to power following the election&apos;s result. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support &#x2014; claiming she won with 60 per cent of the vote. Following the fabricated results, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. When asked on Oct. 23 about Maria Kalesnikava, one of the leaders of the country&apos;s opposition movment kept in prison since Sept. 8, 2020, &#xA0;Lukashenko said she needs to ask for an official pardon. On Nov. 28, 2022, Kalesnikava was admitted to intensive care after suffering severe health issues. She has since been returned to serve her sentence in a penal colony. She is reportedly denied correspondence with her family and friends, and other inmates are prohibited from speaking with her. There have been almost no information on Kalesnikava&apos;s wellbeing since February 2023. Belarusian Air Defense Forces shot down a Russian Shahed-type drone over Yelsk in the southern region of Homiel on Oct. 20, the Belarusian Hajun war monitoring project has reported. As Russia has stepped up its drone attacks on Ukraine over the last month, incursions of Russian combat drones into the country are becoming an almost daily occurrence, with Ukraine reportedly using electronic warfare measures to send the drones off course. According to the monitoring group, at least three drones entered Belarusian airspace overnight on Oct. 20. One, entering at 12:30 a.m. local time, returned to Ukraine after flying over a narrow strip of south-eastern Belarus that reaches down almost to the Kyiv Sea reservoir in Ukraine. Another drone entered Belarus from Ukraine&#x2019;s Zhytomyr Oblast and headed toward the town of Mazyr, where there is an oil refinery. Aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drone at around 1 a.m. near the town of Yelsk, south of Mazyr in Homiel Oblast, where residents reported hearing sounds of explosions. Belarusian officials have not confirmed the downing. On that night, the Ukrainian army reported downing 31 of the 51 attack drones launched in Russia. It said two drones veered off course to Belarus. Shahed-type drone incursions into Belarus have been reported almost daily in the past week, except for Oct. 18-19, when drones were spotted in Ukraine heading for Belarus but failed to reach its territory. Fighters were repeatedly scrambled to intercept the UAVs. The latest incident is the second time Belarus has downed a drone that entered its airspace. Belarus&#x2019;s military first confirmed the downing of a drone over its territory on Sept. 5. Another drone crashed on Oct. 3 in Kalinkavichy, and a witness of the incident, a woman, was arrested. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko claimed on Oct. 4 that the Belarusian Air Force downs &#x201C;a lot of drones,&#x201D; both Russian and Ukrainian, and attributed the incursions to the work of radio-electronic warfare equipment and mistakes by drone operators. No proof of Ukrainian drones entering Belarusian airspace has ever been presented. Russian Shahed-type drones started routinely flying into Belarus in July this year. The Belarusian Hajun project reports spotting 27 UAVs in September alone. Russia&#x2019;s staunchest ally, Minsk, has never publicly raised objections to Moscow over the reported drone incidents. The European Commission has supported Poland&apos;s controversial policy of suspending the right to asylum for illegal migrants that are sent into the country by Belarus and Russia to create tensions on the European Union&#x2019;s eastern borders. &#x201C;Russia and Belarus, or any other country, cannot be allowed to abuse our values, including the right to asylum, and to undermine our democracies,&#x201D; reads a statement from the 27 EU leaders following a meeting in Brussels on Oct. 17. The statement also supports Poland&#x2019;s recent migration program, which includes temporarily suspending the right to asylum. &#x201C;Exceptional situations require appropriate measures,&#x201D; the statement reads. The Polish government on Oct. 15 approved Prime Minister Donald Tusk&#x2019;s program to tighten migration policies and suspend the right to asylum, sparking an outcry among human rights groups and criticism from political opponents and some of Tusk&#x2019;s own coalition members. Polish President Andrzej Duda, in an address to the Polish parliament, argued against the decision, saying it might impede the chances of dissidents from Belarus and Russia receiving asylum. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s put it bluntly: Putin and Lukashenko are trying to destabilize the situation on our border, in the EU, and your response to this is to deprive the people Putin and Lukashenko put in prison and persecute of safe haven,&#x201D; Duda said in response to Tusk&#x2019;s plan. &#x201C;I think this is some kind of fatal mistake.&#x201D; Tusk, however, said the measure would not affect dissidents. The EU&#x2019;s backing is a win for Tusk, who has been seeking to receive European approval for suspending asylum rights should &#x201C;a threat of the destabilization of the state through an influx of migrants&#x201D; occur. Poland has long accused Belarus and Russia of waging a &#x201C;hybrid war,&#x201D; encouraging waves of illegal migrants from Africa and the Middle East to try and cross the borders into the EU in order to put pressure on the country. Belarus denies the accusation. According to the Polish Defense Ministry, Poland stopped 26,000 illegal border crossing attempts in 2024 alone. One soldier was killed in a clash with migrants, and 63 sustained injuries. Belarus unleashed an artificial migration crisis in 2021 in response to the sanctions imposed on the Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime. Poland&#x2019;s officials link the more recent waves to the Kremlin, however, as the incoming migrants tend to have Russian visas. Russia&#x2019;s Ambassador to Belarus, Boris Gryzlov, has said Moscow will assist Minsk if there are &#x201C;attempts to destabilize the situation&#x201D; during the 2025 presidential elections in Belarus, Russian state-affiliated news outlet RIA Novosti reported on Oct. 22. &#x201C;There is no reason to believe that the Belarusian law enforcers and special services will need additional assistance, as they say, &#x2018;on the ground,&#x2019;&#x201D; Gryzlov said in an interview with RIA Novosti. &#x201C;But if necessary, Russia, within the framework of its obligations, will certainly provide (any) assistance and support that our closest ally and strategic partner asks of us.&#x201D; Gryzlov also accused &#x201C;Western states&#x201D; of planning to interfere in the domestic affairs of Belarus and Russia, and claimed that Russia and Belarus had exchanged intelligence regarding the &#x201C;potential threats.&#x201D; The Belarusian Central Election Commission on Oct. 23 announced that the next presidential elections will be held in Belarus on Jan. 26, 2025. Longtime Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has made contradicting statements regarding his plans to &#x201C;run for election.&#x201D; However, with all political parties eliminated in the country, apart from four that are loyal to the regime, and all opposition leaders jailed or exiled, no other realistic challengers to Lukashenko for the presidency are in sight. In 2020, Lukashenko claimed to have won by a landslide, sparking nationwide protests eventually crushed by the regime. The regime began to crackdown on any form of dissent, with the Viasna Human Rights organization reports at least 1,300 political prisoners are currently behind bars, and over 6,000 face charges in politically motivated criminal cases. Belarusian police have detained Ihar Ilyash, a Belarusian journalist, co-author of the book &#x201C;Belarusian Donbas,&#x201D; and the husband of another journalist already jailed for eight years on treason charges. The Belarusian Interior Ministry announced the arrest in a video posted on Oct. 22 on a pro-government channel. In the video, Ilyash confesses to &#x201C;giving interviews to various media resources, including those that have been declared to be &#x2018;extremist&#x2019; in Belarus.&#x201D; Although the official reason for the arrest was not clearly stated, the captions to the video say it is in connection with &#x201C;aiding extremist activities&#x201D; and &#x201C;gathering information for foreign intelligence services.&#x201D; Ilyash, formerly a journalist for the Polish-funded satellite TV channel Belsat, is a freelance writer and political analyst for several online news outlets. With his wife, journalist Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, he co-authored the book Belarusian Donbas, which documents Belarus&#x2019; involvement in Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine since 2014. Published in Kyiv in 2020, the book was slapped with an &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; label in Belarus in March 2021. Despite apparent risks of persecution, Ilyash stayed in Belarus to be close to his arrested wife. Bakhvalava, a correspondent for Belsat, was among the first journalists jailed for livestreaming the nationwide protests in 2020. Having almost served out her initial two-year sentence, she was given an additional eight years in prison. Among the nearly 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, there are 39 journalists and five media workers, Reporters Without Borders says. The country scored 167 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index 2024 and was labeled Europe&#x2019;s most dangerous country for journalists before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

(Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images)At least 26 former Belarusian political prisoners are facing fresh trials in October that could see their sentences become harsher &#x2013; increased from house arrest to imprisonment in penal colonies &#x2013; according to the Viasna Human Rights Center. Between June and September, Viasna recorded 15 trials in which a punishment of house arrest for people convicted in politically motivated cases was replaced with imprisonment. The organization says this is a growing trend. Since the start of the ongoing crackdown on the opposition after the 2020 presidential elections, 1,507 Belarusians have been charged in politically motivated cases and placed under house arrest, a punishment that doesn&#x2019;t meet international criteria for recognizing them as political prisoners, but places them under the strict daily control of the state. House arrest includes a curfew, restricting individuals mainly to their home and workplace, with about two hours allowed for commuting. Convicts must check in at police stations weekly, and law enforcement can conduct home visits at any time of the day or night. Missing a check or returning home late can lead to harsher penalties, including prison time. Primarily, Belarusians are sentenced to house arrest for &#x201C;gross violations of public order&#x201D; or insulting Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko and other officials. While the plight of the country&#x2019;s 1,300 political prisoners has been recognized internationally, the Lukashenko regime also employs less visible forms of punishment to silence dissidents.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-to-reelect-himself-in-january-as-regime-prepares-for-elections/	2024-10-25T04:32:18-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1242954831.jpg
Dutch intelligence confirms Russia deploying North Korean troops to fight Ukraine, minister says	Dutch intelligence has confirmed that Moscow has deployed at least 1,500 North Korean troops to join the war against Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said on Oct. 25. The Netherlands has joined Ukraine, South Korea, and the U.S. in confirming that Pyongyang has sent military personnel to aid Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;We expect the troops will mainly be deployed in Kursk and consist of mainly special units from the North Korean army,&quot; Brekelmans said in comments reported by Reuters. According to the minister, the initial deployment should help Russia test the soldiers and the international reaction. Brekelmans called the move a &quot;clear escalation&quot; and said the West must present an &quot;appropriate response.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The move signals deepening cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow after North Korea also supplied Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly sent to Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the first troops will be deployed to the combat zone on Oct. 27-28. Kyiv and Seoul were raising alarms about the personnel transfer early on, but the U.S. acknowledged their presence only on Oct. 23, becoming the first Western country to do so. The U.S. should &quot;seriously consider taking direct military action against&#x2026; North Korean troops&quot; if they enter Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Michael R. Turner said. Pyongyang has denied the reports, while Russian President Vladimir Putin indirectly hinted at their presence but stopped short of denying or confirming the presence of North Korean troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/dutch-intelligence-confirms-russia-deploying-north-korean-troops/	2024-10-25T04:01:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/dutch.jpg
How Russia attempted to steal Moldovan election, referendum, and what comes next?	Although Russian interference has taken many forms in Moldova since its independence in 1991, the election and referendum results on Sunday shocked many pro-European Moldovans. Despite opinion polls showing clear support for entrenching the desire for EU accession into the country&apos;s constitution, the success of the EU referendum came down to the wire, with the support of the large Moldovan diaspora securing a 50.38% victory margin. The &quot;yes&quot; vote won by a mere 11,000 votes. Moldovan authorities, the EU, and U.S. officials, as well as independent observers, blamed an unprecedented attack on the country&apos;s democracy from criminal networks and political groups tied to Russia. Two weeks before the referendum and presidential election that took place on the same day, Moldovan police and the country&apos;s anti-corruption agency announced that they had evidence that around 130,000 people were to take bribes from Russian-linked forces in an attempt to overturn the referendum&apos;s results. In a press briefing at 1AM, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said that, according to her information, those who were set to disrupt the referendum were incentivized to buy up to 300,000 votes. If true, that would represent about 20% of the 1.5 million ballots cast on Oct. 20. Altogether, the police said fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor transferred $39 million to buy votes in September and October. Shor, who still maintains some political support despite being on the run, denies any wrongdoing.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)Journalistic investigations by Ziarul de Gard&#x103; and Zona de securitate confirmed that the scheme was conducted through Telegram groups and used the Russian state-owned bank Promsvyazbank and its branches in the country&apos;s eastern Russian-influenced breakaway region of Transnistria. &quot;Simple mathematical calculus confirm what the authorities have said: yes, there was massive electoral fraud,&quot; said Tatiana Cojocari, a sociologist from Watchdog, one of the think tanks that commissioned polls in Moldova. &quot;People who would have otherwise not cast their ballots were bought. We had a mass bribe-driven mobilization for the &apos;no&apos; vote in the referendum, just like media investigations showed,&quot; she added. Following the conclusion of the referendum, all eyes are now on the presidential election runoff, set for Nov. 3. Pro-EU President Sandu will run against the former Prosecutor General Alexandr Stoianoglo, whom she dismissed for alleged corruption. Stoianoglo scored 26% in the first round, considerably more than the 9-11% opinion polls predicted. While Stoianoglo, like Sandu, is a double Moldovan-Romanian citizen and publicly says he supports his country&apos;s EU accession, the former prosecutor is supported by the pro-Kremlin Party of Socialists. He also opposed the referendum, dismissing it as serving the interest of Sandu rather than the EU integration process. Days before the election, screenshots from Telegram groups were leaked to the press saying the vote buying network controlled by fugitive oligarch Shor, who now lives in Moscow, was asked to vote for Stoianoglo. Both Shor and Stoianoglo deny any involvement in bribery schemes. &quot;Criminal networks have shown that they are stronger on the technological front than state institutions,&quot; analyst Igor Bo&#x21B;an, from the think tank ADEPT, told Kyiv Independent. To ensure fair elections on Nov. 3 and next summer (during parliament elections), the government would need to block bank transactions from Russia and the use of cryptocurrency in Moldova, through which Russian money is channeled. &quot;If they don&apos;t have the capacity to do it, they should appeal to EU partners for support,&quot; Bo&#x21B;an said. According to analyst Victor Ciobanu, the election results showed a protest vote that should be a &quot;wake-up call&quot; for Sandu&apos;s pro-European government. Since the war in Ukraine, inflation has risen by 40% in Moldova, while salaries and pensions have not caught up. Many blame the rising prices on the government and share a frustration with the slow anti-corruption and judiciary reforms. &quot;But the government can and should be changed only as a result of normal, fair, and honest elections,&quot; Ciobanu said. &quot;What has been happening here for several years now &#x2014; in Orhei, Gagauzia, and now nationally &#x2014; cannot be called elections&quot; because of the overwhelming presence of &quot;dirty money&quot; and &quot;lies,&quot; he said. If the process of corrupting the foundations of democracy is not stopped, Ciobanu argues, in 2025, after parliamentary elections, Moldovans will end up with &quot;a captured mafia state&quot; once again. &quot;And the Kremlin will get a pro-Russian government in Moldova without a single shot (fired) and the opportunity to open a second front against Ukraine,&quot; Ciobanu added. Political scientist Ileana Racheru agrees that if Moscow controls the government, Russia could use Chisinau airport to transport military help via Istanbul or Yerevan. &quot;If the pro-Russians come to power, I don&apos;t think Russia will give them money to keep Moldova afloat, to address chronic poverty. They will need money from the EU and will delay the process (eventually), both to please Russia and to take care of their own business and corruption schemes. But we don&apos;t know if Russia would be happy with the situation,&quot; Racheru said. &quot;They could ask for help in Ukraine,&quot; she added. Bo&#x21B;an, meanwhile, said that such scenarios, where a Russia-friendly government takes over Moldova, are unpredictable and that &quot;for Ukraine, it would not be a problem to neutralize a danger coming from Moldova if they have enough resources.&quot; He is more concerned about the impact such a result would have on Moldova, including a &quot;catastrophic exodus of the young.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/how-russia-tried-to-influence-moldovan-elections-and-referendum-what-it-means-going-forward/	2024-10-25T03:11:15-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178799635.jpg
Kyiv receives lists of missing Ukrainian soldiers via Qatar, ombudsman says	Ukraine has received a list of missing Ukrainian soldiers thanks to mediation by Qatar, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 24 Lubinets made the announcement on his Telegram channel after visiting Qatar and meeting Lolwah Al-Khater, the country&apos;s Foreign Ministry senior official. The Gulf country has previously acted as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia. Lubinets did not specify in his statement whether the lists were provided to Qatar by Moscow or the status of the listed missing soldiers. Apart from the list, he received letters from Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) for their families and discussed the possibility of speeding up the process of POW exchanges between Kyiv and Moscow. The parties also agreed to provide assistance to civilians in difficult life situations, including in restoring personal documents, Lubinets said. According to the Interior Ministry, Ukraine records 55,000 citizens in its register of persons missing under special circumstances as of late September. The register includes people who have disappeared due to war, occupation, or natural and man-made disasters.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-receives-list-of-missing-ukrainian-soldiers-via-qatar-ombudsman-says/	2024-10-25T03:00:47-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2030921955.jpg
Russia to deploy North Korean troops to combat zone on Oct. 27-28, Zelensky says	Editor&apos;s note: The story is being updated. Russia is planning to send first North Korean soldiers to a combat zone on Oct. 27-28, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 25, citing intelligence reports. Speaking after a meeting with the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Zelensky called it an &quot;obvious step toward escalation&quot; that stands in contrast to &quot;disinformation we heard from the Kremlin in recent days.&quot; &quot;The world can clearly see what Russia really wants, and that is to continue the war. That is why we need a principled and strong reaction from the world&apos;s leaders,&quot; Zelensky said. He called on the West to put &quot;tangible pressure&quot; on both Moscow and Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Charter and punish escalation. North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly deployed to the front line in embattled Kursk Oblast, where Ukraine began a cross-border incursion in August and still holds significant swathes of territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-to-deploy-north-korean-troops-to-combat-zone-on-oct-27-28-zelensky-says/	2024-10-25T02:44:08-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1029588238--1-.jpg
We can't have a bad outcome,' JP Morgan Chase CEO says on Ukraine, Russia's nuclear threats	&quot;We can&apos;t have a bad outcome&quot; in Ukraine, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said at an Institute for International Finance (IIF) event on Oct. 24 when discussing Russia&apos;s full-scale war and its nuclear threats. &quot;Nuclear proliferation is the biggest risk mankind faces,&quot; said Dimon, head of the largest U.S. bank and the world&apos;s largest investment bank by revenue. According to him, the West has to have clarity and subordinate many things &quot;to make sure that this ends up right.&quot; Dimon has described himself as a supporter of Ukraine, and JPMorgan Chase has been involved in Ukraine&apos;s recovery efforts. Along with another U.S. investment firm, BlackRock, the company agreed to set up a $15 billion fund for Ukraine. &quot;A lot of other nations that border Russia, they&apos;re quite worried. And some of (those who) don&apos;t border Russia are quite worried,&quot; he said. &quot;And we have never had a situation where a man is threatening nuclear blackmail, &apos;if your military starts to win, we are rolling out the nuclear weapons&apos; type of thing.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The threats have failed to materialize, and Moscow continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. &quot;I think we should be very careful about what we are trying to accomplish in the next couple of years,&quot; Dimon said, voicing a belief that nuclear proliferation is an even greater challenge to humanity than climate change. Putin proposed a series of changes to Russia&apos;s nuclear doctrine in late September. This coincided with the peak of discussions between Ukraine and its key partners to allow Kyiv to strike targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied long-range weapons. The Kremlin announced that Russia could respond to conventional missile strikes with nuclear arms and indicated that Moscow would treat any attack backed by a nuclear-armed country as a coordinated assault. In late September, Dimon described Russia and its two key allies in its all-out war, Iran and North Korea,&quot; as an &quot;evil axis who are working every day on how to make it worse for the Western world and for America.&quot; North Korea has sent nearly 12,000 troops to Russia, including 500 officers and three generals, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. The first soldiers to participate alongside Russian forces in the war against Ukraine have been reportedly deployed to the front line in embattled Kursk Oblast. In return, Russia is helping Pyongyang evade sanctions and develop its nuclear capabilities, according to HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov.	https://kyivindependent.com/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-ukraine/	2024-10-25T02:33:58-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2179863701.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian Buk air defenses, destroys radar guidance system	Ukrainian forces destroyed radar guidance equipment of a Buk-M2 air defense system and struck a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 25 in the occupied part of Luhansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces said. The attack was carried out by Ukraine&apos;s Unmanned Systems Forces and other military units. The General Staff did not elaborate on other possible damage apart from the destroyed guidance system. The Russian targets were hit &quot;several dozens of kilometers behind the front line,&quot; the statement read. Buk is a family of self-propelled, medium-range air defense systems developed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union. The Buk-M2 and M3 are modernized variants, capable of shooting down aerial targets like tactical ballistic missiles at a range of 50 and 65 kilometers, respectively (30 and 40 miles). Russian proxy forces used a Buk missile to shoot down the MH17 Malaysian airliner over Donetsk Oblast on July 17, 2014, in the early months of the Donbas War. Ukraine previously destroyed a Buk-M3 system overnight on Oct. 21, the military said. Ukrainian forces have destroyed 982 Russian anti-aircraft systems throughout the full-scale war, the General Staff said in its regular morning report on Oct. 25.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-buk-systems/	2024-10-25T01:59:02-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Buk-M3.jpg
Russian National Guard attacked in Chechnya, 1 killed	Members of the Russian National Guard (Rosgvardiya) came under an attack by unknown assailants in Chechnya, leaving one service member killed and another injured, the guard told the state news agency TASS on Oct. 24. The incident took place near Grozny, the capital of Russia&apos;s predominantly Muslim republic in the North Caucasus ruled by Vladimir Putin&apos;s ally, dictator Ramzan Kadyrov. Chechnya fought two wars of independence against Russia in the 1990s and 2000s, which resulted in Moscow reasserting its rule after a long and bloody conflict. The injured service member was taken to the hospital. Efforts to find and detain the attackers are underway, the guard told TASS, without saying who was behind the attack. According to the Russian Telegram channel Baza, the attack took place around midday on Oct. 24 near the village of Petropavlovskaya, which lies some 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast of Grozny. Unknown attackers shot at a Ural truck and fled the scene afterward, Baza claimed. The channel shared a picture of the killed serviceman. The Chechen anti-government group Niyso also reported on the attack on its Telegram channel, sharing the footage. The Kyiv Independent is not publishing some of the footage due to its sensitive nature. Pro-Kremlin Chechen fighters (&quot;Kadyrovites&quot;) have been fighting on Russia&apos;s side since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion. In turn, anti-Russian Chechen volunteers have also joined the war on Ukraine&apos;s side, forming several formations like the Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-national-guard-attacked-in-chechnya/	2024-10-25T01:11:07-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-24_19-35-53--2--1.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 6, injure 16 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine killed six people and injured 16 others over the past day, regional authorities said on Oct. 25. Ukrainian forces downed 36 out of 63 Shahed-type drones and other unidentified drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Sixteen more drones were &quot;lost,&quot; it added. The aerial targets were destroyed over 12 oblasts across Ukraine, with around 15 drones downed near Kyiv, according to local authorities. Five people were killed in the settlements of Oleksiyevo-Druzhkivka, Zelene, and Dachenske in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin said. One more person was injured in the region over the past day. Russian forces attacked the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast with an ODAB-1500 air bomb, killing a 73-year-old woman and injuring 10 other people, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. The strike partially destroyed a two-story commercial building and damaged 12 stalls, a kindergarten, and several residential buildings. In Kherson Oblast, Russian forces targeted 26 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. Five people were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-6-injure-16-over-past-day/	2024-10-25T01:02:17-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/photo_2024-10-24_13-03-25-1.jpg
Russia provided Yemen's Houthis with satellite data to attack vessels in Red Sea, WSJ reports	Yemen&apos;s Houthi militants have been using Russian satellite data to attack ships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 24, citing a person familiar with the matter and two unnamed European defense officials. The Houthis are an Iran-backed militant group based in Yemen. Following Israel&apos;s invasion of Gaza in 2023, the Houthis began launching attacks against Western shipping vessels in the Red Sea. Russian targeting data helped the Houthis expand their strikes, the sources told the WSJ. The data was reportedly handed over through Iran&apos;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Such assistance shows how much Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to undermine the Western economic and political order, the WSJ wrote. According to experts, Russia is trying to foment instability from the Middle East to Asia to cause problems for the U.S. The WSJ reported in early October that infamous Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was released in a prisoner swap between Russia and the U.S. in 2022, was suspected of preparing a small arms deal with Houthi militants. Iran, one of Russia&apos;s key allies, was also brokering secret negotiations between Moscow and Yemen&apos;s Houthis to transfer Yakhont supersonic anti-ship missiles, Reuters reported in late September, citing seven unnamed sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-provided-yemens-houthis-with-satellite-data-to-attack-vessels-in-red-sea-wsj-reports/	2024-10-24T23:50:04-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2152895460.jpg
Musk has been in contact with Putin since 2022, WSJ reports	Business tycoon Elon Musk, one of the richest people in the world, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials since late 2022, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Oct. 25, citing undisclosed official sources. Musk, known as the founder and CEO of the space and telecom company SpaceX and the owner of the social media platform X, came out in support of Ukraine at the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, donating Starlink communication terminals that greatly assisted Ukrainian defenders. His views progressively shifted toward pro-Russian positions later during the war, and the billionaire prevented Ukraine from using Starlink terminals in strikes on the Russian fleet. He has also complained that he is &quot;losing money&quot; by providing Starlink service to Ukraine. The business tycoon, who has backed the campaign of Republican presidential nominee and ex-U.S. President Donald Trump, has previously denied sympathizing with Moscow and claimed he talked with Putin only once in April 2021 about space-related topics. Former and current European, U.S., and Russian officials told the WSJ that Musk has held further conversations with Putin and other high-ranking Kremlin officials since late 2022. This reportedly included Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin&apos;s first deputy chief of staff, who has been named as the top figure of Russian propaganda and disinformation activities. Since Musk acquired X (formerly known as Twitter), experts have pointed out a sharp rise of disinformation, hate speech, and radical and pro-authoritarian content on the platform. Musk, an avid user of the platform himself, used it to speak out against the passage of a Ukraine aid bill earlier this year and said that &quot;there is no way in hell&quot; that Russia could lose the war. Putin also asked Musk not to activate Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to Beijing, which claims the island as its sovereign territory, the WSJ wrote. Starlink is currently not active in Taiwan. The Kremlin has denied communicating with Musk, and White House officials told the WSJ they are not aware of it. Musk did not respond to the WSJ&apos;s request for comment. According to the WSJ, the contacts are a well-kept secret in the U.S. government due to Musk&apos;s access to sensitive information as a major security and technology contractor. SpaceX, which operates Starlink, was awarded a classified $1.8 billion contract in 2021, reportedly to build a network of spy satellites for U.S. intelligence. Security-related concerns regarding Musk also arose over Russia&apos;s increasing use of Starlink terminals bought via third-party countries, boosting Russian forces as they grind on in Ukraine&apos;s east. Musk said that SpaceX does not sell equipment to Moscow and that it would not operate in Russia. The matter is all the more sensitive as Musk has become an increasingly vocal supporter of Trump, even joining him at a rally in Pennsylvania in early October. The former president said that he could appoint Musk to run a &quot;government efficiency commission&quot; if he wins the election. Trump has previously criticized the support the Biden administration has provided to Ukraine, sparking fears he might withdraw Washington&apos;s support if re-elected on Nov. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-putin-wsj/	2024-10-24T23:42:13-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1853200567.jpg
Kyiv preparing internal plan to 'strengthen Ukraine,' Zelensky confirms	Ukraine is developing an internal plan for strengthening the country in the economic, military, informational, and other spheres, President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed in his evening address on Oct. 24. According to Zelensky, the internal plan, together with the victory plan, will ensure that Ukraine &quot;has the right answers to all the challenges of this year and next year.&quot; The confirmation comes days after a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Kyiv is preparing an action plan to withstand Russia&apos;s full-scale war. The plan is not an alternative to Zelensky&apos;s victory plan and provides for steps to be taken by Ukraine itself. The president tasked Ukrainian top officials with developing the plan. The president said Ukraine&apos;s economy, countering Russian disinformation, social protection, and &quot;the issue of justice&quot; need to be strengthened. &quot;This plan for internal strengthening will also guarantee Ukraine&apos;s unity,&quot; he added. The plan is expected to be prepared and presented to the Ukrainian public by the end of 2024, BBC Ukraine reported earlier on Oct. 23, citing unnamed government sources. The Kyiv Independent&apos;s source said that it may take several more weeks to develop the document. Zelensky publicly unveiled his five-point victory plan on Oct. 16, which includes Ukraine&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed atop the list. The victory plan also includes a defense aspect, non-nuclear deterrence of Russian aggression, economic growth and cooperation, and post-war security architecture. It is also comprised of three classified addenda that have been shared with international partners. Ukraine&apos;s president said that a victory plan &quot;can bridge the gap between the current situation and the successful peace summit.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-internal-plan/	2024-10-24T23:05:41-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177266193-1.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 685,910 troops since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 685,910 troops since the beginning of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Oct. 25. This number includes 1,630 casualties Russian forces suffered over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,097 tanks, 18,287 armored fighting vehicles, 27,365 vehicles and fuel tanks, 19,753 artillery systems, 1,238 multiple launch rocket systems, 982 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 17,670 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-685-910-troops-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-10-24T22:16:55-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820433.jpg
Putin acknowledges possible presence of North Korean troops in Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to indirectly acknowledge reports of North Korean troops in Russia when speaking to foreign journalists on Oct. 24. He referred to the mutual defense clause in Russia and North Korea&#x2019;s newly signed security treaty. Asked about satellite images provided by South Korean intelligence, allegedly showing North Korean soldiers heading to Russia, Putin replied, &quot;images are a serious thing; if there are images, they reflect something,&quot; stopping short of confirming or denying the claims, which the United States has also raised. Putin then pointed to the Russia-North Korea defense treaty, which Russia&#x2019;s parliament ratified on Oct. 24: &quot;As for our relations with the DPRK, the treaty was ratified today; it has Article 4. We have never doubted that North Korean leadership takes the agreement seriously.&quot; Article 4 of the agreement specifies that if either nation faces an &quot;armed invasion,&quot; the other is committed to providing &quot;military and other assistance with all means in its possession.&quot; This provision establishes the closest military alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang since the Cold War. In August, Ukrainian forces crossed into Russia, seizing control of several hundred square miles in the Kursk region. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Oct. 24 that the first North Korean soldiers had been deployed alongside Russian forces on the front line in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has sent around 12,000 troops, including 500 officers and three generals, with initial sightings reported on Oct. 23.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-acknowledges-possible-presence-of-north-korean-troops-in-russia/	2024-10-24T22:00:09-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178238738.jpg
Sanctions delay to Russian zinc mine results in supply miscalculations, Reuters reports	Western sanctions on Russia&apos;s Ozernoye zinc mine have left the company struggling to replace key equipment needed to boost production, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. This shortage is expected to impact global zinc supply forecasts for 2025, with projections likely overstated. Without Ozernoye&#x2019;s significant contribution, the ongoing shortage of zinc concentrate&#x2014;an essential raw material for producing zinc metal used in galvanizing steel&#x2014;is expected to continue. This supply crunch has already driven zinc prices to a 20-month high. Ozernoye has told Reuters it plans to produce zinc concentrate in volumes similar to previous targets, despite these challenges. Ozernoye, which began production in September, aimed to reach full capacity by 2025 with an annual output of about 320,000 metric tons of zinc in concentrate, equivalent to 2.5% of the global mined zinc supply projected for next year, according to the International Lead &amp; Zinc Study Group (ILZSG). The ILZSG had forecast an 8.9% increase in zinc supply outside China for 2025, factoring in Ozernoye&apos;s ramp-up. However, the sources indicated that Ozernoye has not yet produced any material due to difficulties replacing the components needed to process ore into concentrate, which were damaged in a fire in November 2023. These components, originally supplied by Glencore Technology, are no longer available to Ozernoye due to U.S. sanctions imposed after the fire. Glencore, which uses similar equipment in its Australian operations, confirmed it would comply with all sanctions but declined to comment further.	https://kyivindependent.com/sanctions-delay-to-russian-zinc-mine-triggers-supply-miscalculations-reuters-reports/	2024-10-24T19:47:00-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2144464230.jpg
Moscow funneled $39 million into Moldova ahead of presidential election in attempt to influence results, Moldovan authorities say	Moscow funneled a total of $39 million in a scheme led by a pro-Russian oligarch aimed at influencing election results by paying ordinary citizens to vote against closer ties with the West, the country&apos;s national police chief said on Oct. 24. Ilan Shor, a Moldovan-Israeli tycoon, is accused of laundering the money and orchestrating the network, despite his political party being banned. The election, held on Oct. 20, saw incumbent pro-European Moldovan President Maia Sandu come in first in the initial round of the country&apos;s presidential election on Oct. 20 with 42% of the vote, heading for a run-off on Nov. 3. Voters also voted in favor of a referendum to enshrine the country&apos;s path to European Union accession in the Moldovan constitution by a razor-thin margin, in a blow to supporters who wanted to see closer ties to Russia. Moldovan authorities said that in September over $15 million in Russian funds had been funneled to over 130,000 Moldovans, with voters instructed on how to vote and spread disinformation about the EU via Telegram. Another $24 million was &quot;poured&quot; in throughout the month of October, authorities said, Moldova media reported. At the time, Moldova&#x2019;s chief of police, Viorel Cern&#x103;u&#x21B;eanu, told POLITICO that &quot;Moldova is facing a phenomenon of voter bribery, combined with hybrid warfare and disinformation, the likes of which our country has never seen before.&quot; Moldova&apos;s Foreign Ministry said that police raids are ongoing for those involved in the operations law enforcement officers. Authorities said they arrested individuals on Oct. 23 that they had found with envelopes with cash intended to allegedly bribe voters in 19 districts. Sandu will face off against her main competitor, Alexandr Stoianoglo, who is supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists and gained roughly 26% of the vote in the first round. Chisinau has been supportive of Ukraine throughout the full-scale war and cracked down on Russian subversive operations at home, expelling dozens of diplomats and embassy staff in July 2023 after revelations of espionage activities. Russia&apos;s invasion sparked fears in Moldova of a possible spillover of hostilities, namely via the Russian-occupied Moldovan region of Transnistria.	https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-funneled-39-million-into-moldova-ahead-of-presidential-election-in-attempt-to-influence-results-moldovan-authorities-say/	2024-10-24T15:47:23-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1738459748.jpeg
Ukraine cannot join NATO while at war, Scholz says	Speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF on Oct. 24, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Kyiv&apos;s appeals for an immediate invitation to join NATO, stating that &quot;a country at war absolutely cannot become a member of NATO.&quot; &quot;Everyone knows that, there is no disagreement on this subject,&quot; Scholz added. The comments appear to be the first public comments made by Scholz on Ukraine&apos;s NATO aspirations since President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled his five-point victory plan to Western allies, which includes Kyiv&apos;s invitation to join NATO placed at the top of the list. Germany was reportedly previously known to have reservations about the move. According to the information obtained by the Kyiv Independent, Kyiv had planned to ask for NATO membership within months, not years. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024 the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. During the interview, Scholz said that NATO allies &quot;have described a perspective&quot; on Ukraine&apos;s eventual accession to the alliance, adding &quot;but I think that beyond that, there is currently no need for any new decision.&quot; Further rejecting Zelensky&apos;s calls for an invitation to join the alliance as outlined in the victory plan, Scholz said that &quot;an invitation is normally quite quickly linked to membership.&quot; Earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Germany has softened its stance on Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership, but remains &quot;skeptical.&quot; &quot;But still, the U.S. will have an impact on this (skepticism)... We believe that they are consolidating their thoughts on NATO and this has an impact on, for example, Hungary and Slovakia,&quot; Zelensky said on Oct. 22. According to Zelensky, who has repeatedly called on partners to issue a membership invitation to Kyiv, Ukraine will join NATO only after Russia&apos;s full-scale war ends, the president said in April. Earlier on Oct. 24, following a meeting Scholz in Berlin, Slovak President Peter Pellegrini said that Ukraine&apos;s immediate accession to NATO was &quot;not realistic.&quot; &quot;We agreed with the Chancellor that today the issue of Ukraine&apos;s accession is not on the table, and it cannot come to the table,&quot; Pellegrini said. Pellegrini&apos;s comments come just a day after Politico reported that at least seven NATO countries are reluctant to grant Ukraine an invitation to join NATO, according to four anonymous U.S. and NATO officials and diplomats. Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told reporters that NATO does not currently have plans to invite Ukraine into the alliance in the immediate future.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-cannot-join-nato-immediately-scholz-says/	2024-10-24T14:10:19-07:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
