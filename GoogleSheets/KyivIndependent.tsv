Zelensky appoints new Ground Forces of Ukraine commander	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky appointed General Mykhailo Drapatyi as Ukraine&apos;s Ground Forces commander, the president announced on Nov. 29. Drapatyi is expected to replace Oleksandr Pavliuk who has served in the position since Feb. 11, 2024. &quot;Major General Mykhailo Drapatyi successfully organized the defense in the Kharkiv sector and disrupted the Russian offensive,&quot; Zelensky said on social media, without elaborating on the reason for the reshuffle. Drapatyi served as a commander of Ukraine&apos;s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade from 2016-2019. He has headed the &quot;Kharkiv&quot; operational grouping of troops since this May and &quot;Luhansk&quot; operational and tactical group of forces since September.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-appoints-new-ground-forces-commander/	2024-11-29T07:24:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-29-170402.png
North Korea has given Russia more than 100 ballistic missiles, 5 million artillery shells, Ukraine says	North Korea has supplied Russia with more than 100 short-range ballistic missiles, and 5 million artillery shells, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said on Nov. 29. In comments to Interfax-Ukraine, HUR also said Pyongyang had begun supplying Moscow with artillery systems last month. &quot;In total, over 100 pieces of various equipment have been transferred, including 170-mm M-1989 self-propelled artillery systems, and 240-mm M-1991 multiple rocket launchers,&quot; it said. &quot;Additionally, North Korea continues to supply Russia with large-calibre artillery ammunition and short-range ballistic missiles of the Kn-23/24 type.&quot; HUR added that as of this month, over 5 million artillery rounds and 100 artillery shells have been delivered. On the same day, Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in Pyongyang for an official visit amid deepening military cooperation between the two countries. Belousov&apos;s visit to Pyongyang comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s state visit to the hermit country in June, where Russia formally deepened it military and economic cooperation with Pyongyang. Pyongyang is believed to have dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has also become Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. A source with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also indicated to Reuters on Nov. 23 that the majority of North Korean soldiers were finalizing training. In recent months, Russia has focused on regaining territory lost in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast following a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region in August. According to the source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks. NATO allies believe that Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, the Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-has-given-russia-more-than-100-ballistic-missiles-5-million-artillery-shells-ukraine-says/	2024-11-29T06:45:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152788663.jpg
Syrskyi orders deployment of more reserves to Pokrovsk, Kurakhove directions in Donetsk Oblast	Ukrainian forces stationed near the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast will be additionally supplied with reserves, ammunition, weapons, and military equipment, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 29. Prior to the statement, Syrskyi visited Ukrainian units in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions of the front line. &quot;The main goal is to personally talk to the commanders who are directly engaged in combat, to solve problematic issues and provide comprehensive assistance,&quot; Syrskyi wrote on his Telegram channel. &quot;We continue to deter the enemy and inflict heavy losses in manpower and equipment. I am grateful to our soldiers for their resilience and bravery in the fight against the Russian aggressor.&quot; Ukrainian officials have increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. Russia has captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in the past week, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo. Russia&apos;s advance has picked up pace over the past months as Ukraine&apos;s military struggles to replenish its ranks, and Western arms are not flowing in as fast as Kyiv has hoped. The outgoing Biden administration seeks to speed up materiel deliveries before Trump takes office. Washington has provided Ukraine&apos;s forces with new capabilities to stall the Russian advance, such as long-range strikes on Russian territory or anti-personnel mines.	https://kyivindependent.com/syrsky-orders-to-deploy-more-reserves-to-pokrovsk-kurakhove-directions-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-11-29T05:57:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-29-15_33_32.jpeg
Ukraine retrieves bodies of 502 fallen soldiers	Ukraine has repatriated the bodies of 502 soldiers who died fighting against Russia, the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of the Prisoners of War reported on Nov. 29. The Geneva Conventions stipulate that those who lose their lives during war are entitled to a dignified burial. As of early March, Ukraine has identified more than 2,800 bodies and body fragments of fallen soldiers, according to Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets. The bodies of 397 soldiers were recovered from Donetsk Oblast, while 64 were brought back from Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and 24 from Luhansk Oblast. Another 17 bodies were repatriated from morgues in Russia. &quot;Law enforcement officials and forensic experts will identify those killed,&quot; the headquarters wrote in a post on Telegram. The operation to recover the fallen soldiers involved several government and military agencies, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the Interior Ministry, the State Emergency Service, and the Armed Forces. The headquarters also thanked the International Committee of the Red Cross for its assistance. On Nov. 8, the bodies of 563 fallen Ukrainian soldiers were returned to Ukraine. Meanwhile, on Oct. 18, the bodies of 501 Ukrainian troops were also retrieved. In late February, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that about 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-retrieves-bodies-of-502-fallen-soldiers/	2024-11-29T05:28:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175211787.jpg
Turkey won't support peace plan with territorial concessions, Ukrainian lawmaker says	Turkey won&apos;t support a peace plan that involves freezing the war in Ukraine and Kyiv making territorial concessions to Moscow, Ukrinform reported on Nov. 29, citing Ukrainian lawmaker Ahtem Chiygoz. Chiygoz earlier took part in a meeting of the friendship groups of the parliaments of Ukraine and Turkey in Ankara. During the event, Turkish officials expressed support for Ukraine&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, including the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula, Chiygoz said. &quot;There are constant accusations, especially from the Russian side, that Turkey is committed to a peace formula that involves freezing the conflict and concessions in territorial integrity,&quot; he added. &quot;During our two-day visit to Turkey, we held meetings at a very high level and were assured everywhere that this was not true.&quot; Turkey supports Ukraine in many ways, and both countries are interested in developing bilateral strategic relations, including parliamentary cooperation, according to the lawmaker. &quot;Turkey not only has hopes but is working to ensure that the changes after the elections in America do not affect the provision of assistance to Ukraine. These were important messages for us. And we will convey them to the authorities and people of Ukraine.&quot; &quot;This visit has also become the basis for our bilateral cooperation to be closer, and the role of our parliaments in it will now be more active.&quot; On Nov. 18, Bloomberg reported, citing undisclosed sources, that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would propose his peace plan for Ukraine during the G20 talks. Erdogan&apos;s proposal reportedly included Ukraine foregoing joining NATO for at least 10 years, freezing the current front line, providing Ukraine with weapons, and deploying international troops to a demilitarized buffer zone in the Donbas. The Turkish leader&apos;s proposal came as NATO countries prepare for a Donald Trump presidency, which many fear will lead to the U.S. pressuring Ukraine to end the war quickly, even at the cost of territorial concessions. The Kremlin on Nov. 18 dismissed a peace plan for Ukraine reportedly to be put forward by Erdogan, describing it as &quot;unacceptable.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/turkey-assures-that-it-wont-support-peace-plan-with-territorial-concessions-lawmaker-says/	2024-11-29T05:24:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239585119.jpg
2 Ukrainian journalists came under Russian fire in Kharkiv Oblast	Two journalists from the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske came under Russian attack in Kharkiv Oblast on Nov. 25 while filming a story about volunteers evacuating abandoned horses. Journalists Ksiusha Savoskina and Oleksii Nikulin went to film the evacuation of animals together with volunteers from Kharkiv Animal Rescue at an abandoned farm on the left bank of the Kupiansk district, Hromadske reported on Nov. 28. The group was accompanied by a soldier, as he had spotted the horses from the Ukrainian forces&apos; positions. As the evacuation of the horses began, a Russian drone appeared overhead, forcing everyone inside a building. Later, an explosion occurred &#x2014; the car, along with the journalists&apos; backpack containing lenses for filming, were destroyed as a result of the attack. &quot;Since then, we tried not to leave the hangar. The volunteers were supposed to put the horses in a trailer, and we decided that we would not leave (the hangar) the whole day until it got dark because it was very dangerous &#x2014; (the Russians) had probably already spotted us,&quot; Savoskina said. Another explosion also set a neighboring building on fire. The journalist suggested that Russian forces might have dropped a mine on it. &quot;Despite this, everyone remained healthy. The horses are also unharmed &#x2014; they are now in Kharkiv, then they will be transported to a children&apos;s equestrian school,&quot; Savoskina said. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and approached the city&#x2019;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Earlier in November, Ukrainian forces successfully repelled Russian attempts to break into the city. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState also reported on Nov. 26 that Ukrainian forces had completed clearing Kupiansk of Russian soldiers. Kupiansk is a key logistics and railway hub in the eastern part of Kharkiv Oblast. With several highways and five railway lines running through it, the town was briefly occupied by Russian forces before it was liberated during a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the autumn of 2022. Capturing the city would widen the north-to-south supply route from Russia&apos;s Belgorod Oblast, fuelling their attempt to take the entire Donbas region.	https://kyivindependent.com/2-ukrainian-journalists-came-under-russian-fire-in-kharkiv-oblast/	2024-11-29T04:55:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178114144.jpg
Belarus Weekly: Lukashenko threatens internet shutdown in case of protests during 2025 elections	Thirty-eight Russian combat drones enter Belarus on Nov. 24-25, marking the most significant overnight incursion so far and nearing the previous monthly record. Alexander Lukashenko threatens to shut down the internet in Belarus should protests occur during the 2025 presidential election. A Belarusian who fought on behalf of Ukraine as a volunteer against Russia faces over 20 years of prison time or potentially a death penalty under Lukashenko&#x2019;s regime after being denied residence in the EU and extradited from Vietnam to Belarus. Lukashenko &#x201C;pardoned&#x201D; 32 more political prisoners in the sixth round of releases. The total count so far: 178 people released, yet 223 newly recognized political prisoners were added, Viasna reported. Seven hundred Belarusian activists, journalists, and Kastus Kalinouski Regiment volunteers were added to Russia&#x2019;s wanted list. Thirty-eight Russian Shahed-type kamikaze drones flew into Belarus overnight on Nov. 24-25, marking an absolute record of daily incursions, the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun reported. As Russia continues to intensify its drone attacks against Ukrainian cities, incursions of Russian drones into Belarus surged from infrequent, isolated instances in July to 27 stray drones spotted over Belarus in September. The daily incursions record runs up close to a monthly total of 49 incursions recorded in October. Belarusian aviation scrambled to intercept the UAVs four times, shutting down at least one, Belarusian Hajun says. Dozens of drones crossed through the so-called &#x201C;Belarusian corridor,&#x201D; a narrow strip of Belarusian territory sandwiched between the Kyiv and Chernihiv oblasts of Ukraine. In an attack on Nov. 24-25, Russia launched a total of 145 drones at Ukrainian targets overnight, with Ukrainian air defenses downing 71 of the attack drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said. The official Minsk has never publicly raised objections to Moscow &#x2014; its key ally &#x2014; over the reported drone incidents. Belarusian authorities have confirmed downing a Russian drone over its territory for the first time on Sept. 5. Fragments of a Russian UAV Shahed-136 (Geran-2) lie on the ground at the site where rescue workers extinguish the fire at warehouse and trade buildings damaged by Russian attack on Nov. 7, 2024 in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Roman Petushkov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Belarusian authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko claimed on Oct. 4 that the Belarusian Air Force downs &#x201C;a lot of drones,&#x201D; both Russian and Ukrainian, and attributed the incursions to the work of radio-electronic warfare equipment and mistakes by drone operators. He did not provide evidence of Ukrainian drone incursions. The Belarusian Hajun group dismissed the claims as false. Over the past six months, 700 Belarusian activists, journalists, and volunteers fighting on Ukraine&#x2019;s side were added to Russia&#x2019;s wanted list, Mediazona Belarus reported on Nov. 26. Belarus and Russia are part of the Interstate Wanted Persons Treaty of the Commonwealth of Independent States or CIS, the Russian-led political alliance of former post-Soviet countries. In February 2024, the Russian Interior Ministry wanted list was first found to include over 3,100 Belarusian citizens. The new additions to the list include Pavel Shurmei and Dzianis Prokharau, current and former commanders of the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment fighting in Ukraine, as well as recently arrested in Vietnam Vasil Verameichyk, the regiment&#x2019;s former member. Investigative journalists of the Media Bureau project and Belarusian Investigative Center have been added to the database along with journalists from Polish-backed Belsat, sports media Tribuna, former head of the Belarusian service Radio Liberty, journalist Alexander Lukashuk. In 2022 alone, Russia extradited 16 Belarusians accused of &#x201C;extremism&#x201D; &#x2014; a charge widely used against political opponents of Lukashenko. In February, then-Belarusian Ambassador to Russia Dzmitry Krutoy, who is currently heading Lukashenko&#x2019;s administration, claimed that Minsk and Moscow were unifying the &#x201C;lists of extremists and extremist resources.&quot; The international police organization Interpol has stopped executing Belarusian politically motivated search warrants. However, Belarusians are subject to extradition in Russia and most CIS countries. Vietnam extradited Vasil Verameichyk, a former Belarusian military officer who fought against Russia in Ukraine, to Belarus, where he faces over 20 years of imprisonment or the death penalty, Belarusian media reported on Nov. 20. Verameichyk, who supported the 2020 protests and joined the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment to fight on Ukraine&#x2019;s side in the early days of Russia&#x2019;s all-out invasion, was wounded in combat in April 2022. Following discharge from military service, he was elected in 2024 to Belarus&#x2019; exiled Coordination Council, a group opposing the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. Belarusian propaganda broadcasted his arrest in a documentary on Nov. 20, showing Verameichyk disembarking the plane with his hands tied, accompanied by security personnel from an otherwise empty plane. The report accused Belarusian volunteers in Ukraine of planning an invasion of Belarus. Konstantin Bychek, head of the investigative department of the Belarus KGB, said in the film that Belarusian justice will reach those Belarus considers &#x201C;extremists and terrorists&#x201D; in any place on Earth. As the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment was declared a terrorist organization and Lukashenko has broadened the use of capital punishment to apply in case of an attempted terrorist act, Belarusian activists fear Verameichyk risks not only a heavy prison sentence but also death row. Vasil Verameichyk moved to Vietnam after being denied residence in Lithuania and, reportedly, entry back to Ukraine. He was detained on Nov. 13 and hastily deported the next day, according to the opposition-led Coordination Council. Belarus and Vietnam signed an extradition agreement in December 2023. However, the expert in international criminal law, Ales Mikhalevich, suggests that rapid deportation goes against a typical timeline, which requires 40-50 days for the procedure. &#x201C;I am 99% sure that Vasil was &#x2018;on the radar&#x2019; for some time. If he was really detained in a criminal case, such a quick extradition would not have happened,&#x201D; Mikhalevich told the independent outlet Zerkalo. Lithuania, a country that hosts Verameichyk&#x2019;s wife and daughter, recognized him as a threat to national security over his prior service in the Belarusian army and banned him from entering the EU. Lithuania&#x2019;s State Security Department maintained that the decision was justified. &#x201C;It cannot be ruled out that attempts to escalate this story from outside may be another information operation against Lithuania,&#x201D; Lithuania&#x2019;s public broadcaster LRT quotes the department&#x2019;s statement. Lukashenko deprived Verameichyk of his military rank with a decree signed in September 2022. Former Belarusian volunteers told the Kyiv Independent that Verameichyk told them that he could not return to Ukraine over an entry ban. Andrei Kushnerau, who co-founded the Association of Belarusian Volunteers in Ukraine together with Verameichyk and coordinated the efforts to help him, told the Kyiv Independent that Verameichyk attributes the ban to a conflict with some of the regiment&#x2019;s staff members. Several volunteers encountered such a ban in 2022. According to Kushnerau, Verameichyk sought to return to Ukraine in 2025 as soon as the entry ban expired. The Kastus Kalinouski Regiment is undergoing restructuring after two leaders of the formation were accused of corruption. At the press conference in Vilnius, the new leader, Pavel Shurmei, said that the regiment didn&#x2019;t take part in imposing any restrictions on Verameichyk, but did not deny that an entry ban exists. Belarusian activists urge states to engage in negotiations with the Lukashenko regime to exchange the former volunteer. &#x201C;The man is now under the threat of (&#x2026;) of execution, precisely because he fought for Ukraine, so the case of a prisoner of war works quite well,&#x201D; Kushnerau told the Kyiv Independent. The Coordination Council set forward a statement, calling on Ukraine to include Verameichyk on the list of Ukrainian POWs or swap him for Belarusian spies arrested in Lithuania or Ukraine. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled leader of the Belarusian opposition, called on the international community to end cooperation with the regime on extraditing Belarusians and to consider cases individually so that a single line on a CV can&#x2019;t become grounds for labeling a person as a national security threat. &#x201C;No one should be handed over to Lukashenka&#x2019;s KGB. Don&apos;t reject Belarusians seeking safety from the regime&apos;s terror,&#x201D; Tsikhanouskaya wrote on X. Lukashenko pardoned 32 political prisoners convicted of &#x201C;extremist crimes&#x201D; in the sixth round of releases ahead of the 2025 presidential elections, as some 1,300 dissidents remain behind bars. Eight women and 24 men were released, Lukashenko&#x2019;s press office reported on Nov. 20 without specifying the names. Reportedly, seventeen of them have chronic diseases, and one has a disability. The press office says that all prisoners &#x201C;pleaded guilty, repented&#x201D; and will remain under strict control of the Interior Ministry. This is the sixth instance of the release of political prisoners in Belarus since July. Whereas the total number of released dissidents reached 178, at least 223 individuals were recognized as political prisoners, Viasna Human Rights Center reports. Political prisoners are forced to write pleas for pardon, Viasna notes, which entails admitting the &#x201C;guilt&#x201D; of their crimes. The first wave of pardons coincided with Independence Day, officially celebrated in Belarus on July 3. Eighteen prisoners were released, including the former leader of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front party, Ryhor Kostuseu. The next rounds followed in August , two in September, and one in early November. Mid-November, Lukashenko also allowed a family visit to prominent opposition figure Maria Kalesnikava, who&#x2019;s been held incommunicado for over 600 days. In remarks for BBC earlier in October, Lukashenko claimed he would consider her plea for pardon. Ahead of the 2025 presidential elections, Belarusian propaganda parades the releases as the &#x201C;acts of mercy&#x201D; from the regime. Yet the releases occur against the background of sweeping police raids, targeting hundreds of relatives of political prisoners and former detainees, resulting in new arrests and criminal cases. Human rights activists consider the arrests as a pre-election intimidation campaign. Since the contested 2020 presidential elections, which Lukashenko claimed to win, his regime has been waging repressions against any dissent, jailing over 1,300 political prisoners, eliminating independent media and all but four loyalist parties. Lukashenko admitted to shutting down the internet during the 2020 unrest and claimed he may authorize a full shutdown during the 2025 presidential elections if new protests emerge, state-run news outlet Belta reported on Nov. 22. Lukashenko claimed that the 2020 internet blackout was necessary to protect the country. Speaking to the students of Minsk State Linguistic University, one of the major hubs of the students&#x2019; revolt in 2020, &#x201C;If this (the protests) happens again, we will shut the internet down completely,&#x201D; Lukashenko promised. On Aug. 9, 2020, hundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets in protests against rigged presidential elections that extended Lukashenko&#x2019;s then-26-year rule to a sixth term. The police responded with rubber bullets, tear gas, flash grenades, and severe beatings. Lukashenko denied allegations of violence against demonstrators, asserting, &#x201C;No one was holding down or beating anyone,&#x201D; despite widespread reports of police brutality during the 2020 protests. To curb the spread of information about protests and severe police brutality against their participants, the authorities started blocking the internet, Human Rights Watch said. The independent monitoring recorded a 50% connectivity drop in August 2020. The officials have denied shutting down the internet and explained the blackouts by alleged DDoS attacks on the government infrastructure, the claim experts dismiss. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who received popular support and claimed to take over Lukashenko in 2020&apos;s ballot, interprets the threats to repeat blackouts as a sign of the regime&#x2019;s insecurity. &#x201C;Despite four years of repression and imprisoned people, he (Lukashenko) is afraid of the Belarusian people,&quot; Tsikhanouskaya said at the Halifax International Security Forum. The next presidential elections in Belarus are scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025, half a year ahead of the term permitted by the law. The electoral campaign is accompanied by countrywide police raids against activists, former political prisoners, and their relatives.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-lukashenko-threatens-internet-shutdown-in-case-of-protests-during-2025-elections/	2024-11-29T04:34:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184329764.jpg
HUR Chief Budanov rubbishes new dismissal rumours, blames Russian propaganda ops	The head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) has dismissed fresh rumours of his imminent firing, describing them on Nov. 29 as &quot;rumors and disinformation&quot; spread by Russian propaganda. Earlier in the week, New Voice of Ukraine reported that the Ukrainian President&apos;s Office wanted to replace Kyrylo Budanov with a &quot;a person more loyal to the authorities.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, at a certain point, these narratives were spread in the Ukrainian information space, many of them were replicated by Russian propaganda,&quot; Budanov told BBC Ukraine. &quot;But there is nothing surprising in this. Throwing out rumors and disinformation is what they do to destabilize the country, and to destabilize the team,&quot; he added. Budanov insisted he had &quot;normal working relations&quot; with President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team. It&apos;s not the first time in recent months that rumors of Budanov&apos;s imminent dismissal have circulated. Zelensky on Oct. 21 denied similar rumors. &quot;I wasn&apos;t going to do that. I was not going to replace Budanov. This information was circulating, yes. There was no such question about (Defense Minister Rustem) Umerov either,&quot; Zelensky said during a meeting with journalists. Zelensky&apos;s statement followed media speculation that Budanov was in line for dismissal. Budanov, 38, has been the head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence since August 2020. In late September, Umerov dismissed two of Budanov&apos;s deputies, Viktor Zaitsev and Ihor Ostapenko. The decision was not made in cooperation with Budanov, Ukrainska Pravda reported, citing an undisclosed source.	https://kyivindependent.com/hur-chief-budanov-rubbishes-new-dismissal-rumours-blames-russian-propaganda-ops/	2024-11-29T04:08:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156902890.jpg
Media identifies nearly 81,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Journalists and volunteers have identified the names of 80,973 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine as of Nov. 29, according to a joint investigation by BBC Russia and Mediazona, a Russian independent media outlet. Since Mediazona&apos;s update in mid-November, the names of 3,830 more Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties. Over half of those killed were not affiliated with the army at the beginning of the war in 2022, meaning they voluntarily signed contracts to fight in Ukraine. Many died in the first two to four weeks after being sent to the front line, the investigation said. The share of volunteers now accounts for 22% of the total number of confirmed losses in the Russian army. Last year, in November 2023, volunteers accounted for only 14%. The share of deaths among those sent to the front from prison is on the decline. As of November 2023, they accounted for 26% of all losses, and now 18%. The large-scale involvement of convicts at the front allowed the Russian authorities to support the army&apos;s offensive potential without causing additional damage to the economy. &quot;The convicts were still actively involved in society and were not skilled workers. This distinguishes them, for example, from those mobilized, whose care has weakened several sectors of the economy,&quot; the investigation said. According to the investigation, most of the soldiers killed were from Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Sverdlovsk Oblast. As of the morning of Nov. 29, the Russian army had lost about 738,660 soldiers, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Over the past day, Russian losses amounted to 2,030 people.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-identify-nearly-81-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-11-29T03:26:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1870879351.jpg
Ukraine hits oil depot in Rostov Oblast, destroys Buk radar station in Russian-occupied territory, Kyiv claims	Ukrainian forces reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast, and destroyed a Buk-M3 radar station in Russian-occupied territories in Zaporizhzhia Oblast overnight, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said on Nov. 29. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, and oil refineries. The Ukrainian military said that on the night of Nov. 29, they struck the Atlas oil depot in Rostov Oblast. As a result of the strike, fires broke out on the territory of the facility, the statement said. According to the General Staff, Atlas is part of the Russian military-industrial complex, and supplies petroleum products to the Russian army. The oil depot was previously targeted in the summer of 2024. Elsewhere, a radar station of the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system was destroyed in the Russian-held part of Ukraine&apos;s Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the General Staff reported. The combat mission was carried out by units of the Unmanned Systems Forces, the Special Operations Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) in cooperation with other units of the Defense Forces. On Nov. 16, a drone unit in the National Guard&apos;s 27th Pechersk Brigade destroyed another Russian anti-aircraft missile Buk-M1 system worth $10 million. On the morning of Nov. 29, the General Staff reported that Russia had lost 1,006 air defense systems since the start of its full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-oil-depot-in-rostov-oblast-destroys-buk-radar-station-in-russian-occupied-territory/	2024-11-29T02:39:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240557988.jpg
Russia's reported daily losses in Ukraine pass 2,000 for the first time	Russia&apos;s daily losses in Ukraine surpassed 2,000 for the first time, according to figures released by Kyiv on Nov. 29. According to the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, Moscow&apos;s troops lost 2,030 men over the preceding day. This surpasses the previous record of 1,950 set on Nov. 12. The total figure stands at 738,660. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured. They are broadly in line with estimates from Western nations. Ukraine has largely avoided revealing the full extent of its military casualties. &#xA0;President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowleded only in February that 31,000 Ukrainian fighters have been killed. But estimates by The Economist published on Nov. 26 said between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the full-scale war, and 400,000 more are too injured to fight on. The Economist wrote that Russia and Ukraine lost a greater share of their population than the U.S. during the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Almost one in 20 Ukrainian fighting-age men have been killed or injured because of the war, The Economist wrote. It based its calculations on leaked or published intelligence reports, defense officials, researchers, and open-source intelligence. In September, the Wall Street Journal provided similar estimates, positing that Ukraine had lost 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded. The outlet estimated Russia&apos;s losses at up to 200,000 killed and 400,000 injured. The exact figures for both sides are nearly impossible to establish as Kyiv and Moscow are secretive about their casualties. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. The surge in Russian losses comes as Moscow&apos;s forces step up pressure across the front lines. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost to Ukraine in Kursk Oblast before Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20. A British defense intelligence assessment, seen by The Telegraph, warns that Russia is likely to intensify kamikaze drone attacks on Ukrainian positions, using new launch sites near the border. Ukraine&apos;s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 9 that &quot;tens of thousands of enemy soldiers from the best Russian shock units&quot; are aiming to push Ukrainian forces out of the Russian enclave, raising concerns of a significant escalation in the war. The Kremlin is also facing economic pressures &#x2014; the purchasing power of the Russian ruble this week hit the lowest point since March 2022, as the economic toll of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine becomes glaring. Russia&apos;s expanding spending on the war has fueled inflation, prompting Russia&apos;s Central Bank to hike its interest rate to the highest level since the early 2000s &#x2014; 21 percent &#x2014; to rein in consumer prices. &quot;Russia is currently facing an impossible economic conundrum because of the rapid increase in military expenditures and the Western sanctions,&quot; Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist specializing in post-Soviet countries, told the Kyiv Independent. However, economists and analysts are divided on how much of an impact Russia&apos;s economic problems will have on its war effort.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-reported-daily-losses-in-ukraine-pass-2-000-for-the-first-time/	2024-11-29T01:49:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184752486.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 1, injure 22 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed at least one civilian, and injured at least 22 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 29. Russian forces launched 132 drones at Ukraine overnight from the Russian cities of Orel, Millerovo, Kursk, and Primosk-Akhtarsk, according to a report from Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile units, electronic warfare units, mobile firing groups, and aviation shot down 88 drones in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa oblasts. Forty-one drones were lost allegedly due to electronic warfare countermeasures. Another drone returned to Russia. In Kherson Oblast, Russia targeted 15 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson. As a result of the attacks, one person was killed, and another nine were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Odesa Oblast, Russia attacked the region with several drones, injuring seven people. Four victims were hospitalized, with one woman in a severe condition, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. In three settlements of the Odesa district, 13 residential and country houses, garages, railway infrastructure, outbuildings, a gas pipe, and a car were damaged. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured two people in the town of Kurakhove and one person in the town of Toretsk, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast&apos;s Nikopol district, a 33-year-old man suffered injuries. He was hospitalized with moderately severe injuries, Governor Serhii Lysak said. Drone attacks and artillery shelling damaged 11 houses, six outbuildings, a garage, and a utility company. Strikes damaged power lines and a gas pipeline as well, he added. In Sumy Oblast, one person suffered injuries because of an air strike in the Esman community, the local military administration reported. In Kyiv, the debris of the downed drones fell in three districts of the city, causing a polyclinic in the Dniprovskyi district to catch fire. A security guard at the medical facility was injured and hospitalized, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-1-injure-22-over-past-day/	2024-11-29T01:38:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-29-09_57_40.jpeg
Police disperse protesters in Tbilisi after pro-Russian government refuses to negotiate EU accession	Police have started dispersing protesters who gathered near the parliament for a spontaneous rally in Tbilisi overnight on Nov. 29, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The protest followed Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze&apos;s statement that Georgia&apos;s integration into the European Union could be postponed until 2028, prompting outrage among some in society, who are demanding changes in the country&apos;s political course. The ruling Georgian Dream party led by Kobakhidze has faced accusations of democratic backsliding and steering the South Caucasus country closer to the Kremlin. Earlier this year, the controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law sparked mass protests and violent crackdowns by police. Following the election, the European Commission suspended Georgia&apos;s EU accession process, highlighting the growing rift between Tbilisi and the West. The protest was organized through social media, the media outlet Echo of the Caucasus reported. Protesters claimed the refusal to negotiate accession to the EU by 2028 is &quot;a betrayal of the country&apos;s interests, and a violation of Article 78 of the Georgian Constitution, which enshrines the country&apos;s aspirations for European integration.&quot; Prior to the dispersal, clashes between law enforcement officers and protesters occurred, and lasted for several hours. The police used pepper spray, and demonstrators threw eggs and other objects at the police. Police also used water cannons to break up the demonstration on Chichinadze Street. Several people were beaten by police, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The Georgian Interior Ministry said the action went &quot;beyond the limits of the law.&quot; The ministry noted that three police officers were injured, and two of them were hospitalized. When the Georgian parliament&apos;s decision on the EU became known, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili held emergency consultations with the diplomatic corps and the opposition, and issued a statement afterward, the Georgian media outlet SOVA reported. Zourabichvili previously accused the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party of rigging the recent elections and refused to accept the stated results. Along with other opposition party leaders, she has called for public demonstrations and a parliamentary boycott. According to Zourabichvili, &quot;the non-existent, illegitimate government has declared not peace, but war &#x2014; against its own people, its own past and its own future.&quot; &quot;There is no Georgian statehood, no independence, no future without Russia on this path.&quot; The president said that a few minutes after Kobakhidze&apos;s speech, in which he announced the suspension of European integration, Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;expressed his satisfaction and praised the Georgian authorities for their obedience.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/police-disperse-protesters-in-tbilisi-after-pro-russian-government-refuses-to-negotiate-eu-accession/	2024-11-29T01:08:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186710484.jpg
Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrives in North Korea for official visit	Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in Pyongyang for an official visit on Nov. 29, amid deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. After arriving in Pyongyang, Belousov was greeted by his North Korean counterpart No Kwang-chol, and members of North Korea&apos;s military, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Belousov will participate in meetings with &quot;the military and political leadership of the DPRK,&quot; it added. Belousov&apos;s visit to Pyongyang comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s state visit to the hermit country in June, where Russia formally deepened it military and economic cooperation with Pyongyang. Pyongyang is believed to have dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has also become Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. A source with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also indicated to Reuters on Nov. 23 that the majority of North Korean soldiers were finalizing training. In recent months, Russia has focused on regaining territory lost in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast following a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region in August. According to the source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks. NATO allies believe that Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, the Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-defense-minister-arrives-in-north-korea-for-state-visit/	2024-11-28T22:35:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2163496348.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 738,660 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 738,660 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 29. This number includes 2,030 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,458 tanks, 19,339 armored fighting vehicles, 30,272 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,886 artillery systems, 1,256 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,006 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,750 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-738-660-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-28T22:13:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150597884.jpg
Ukrainian nuclear plants reduce output in response to large-scale Russian attack	Nuclear power plants in Ukraine reduced electricity production on Nov. 28 as a precautionary measure in response to a Russian mass aerial attack on Ukraine, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Mariano Grossi said. For the second time in less than two weeks, the Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and South Ukraine nuclear power plants (NPPs) lowered their power levels following an early morning Russian attack on energy infrastructure across the country. Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack against Ukraine on the morning of Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure across the country, including the far-western regions. Russian forces launched more than 180 drones and missiles at Ukraine. Following the attack, Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s power grid, forcing emergency blackouts to be implemented in multiple regions across the country. &quot;Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure is extremely fragile and vulnerable, putting nuclear safety at great risk,&quot; Grossi said, while adding that none of the reactor sustained damage during the attacks. All nine reactors operating in Ukraine reduced output, with one reactor at the Rivne NPP was disconnected from the grid. All the NPPs continued to receive external electricity despite the Khmelnytskyi NPP losing connection to two of its lines. &quot;The IAEA will continue to assess the extent of damage to facilities and power lines that are essential for nuclear safety and security,&quot; Grossi added. Previously, NPPs in Ukraine reduced electricity output on Nov. 17 following overnight mass attacks on the same day. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023. During the visit of two IAEA teams deployed to NPPs in Ukraine on Nov. 28, they were forced to seek shelter due to ongoing air raid sirens.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-nuclear-plants-reduce-production-in-response-to-russian-attack/	2024-11-28T21:27:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1243382762.jpg
Oil depot burning in Russia's Rostov Oblast amid drone attack, local media reports	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. A large fire has engulfed an oil depot in Russia&apos;s Rostov Oblast overnight on Nov. 29, local media reported. Eyewitnesses reported seeing large clouds of smoke over the FDKU Atlas oil depot in the Kamensk-Shakhtinsky District of Rostov Oblast. Videos of the fire posted on various Telegram channels appear to show a large blaze engulfing the night sky. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the location of reported fire. Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the reported attack. Ahead of the start of the blaze, acting Rostov Oblast Governor Yuri Slyusar claimed Russian air defenses intercepted 30 Ukrainian drones in the northwest of the region. The governor added that emergency services are &quot;extinguishing a large fire at an industrial site,&quot; without specifying the location. Slyusar also claimed two houses were damaged in the Masalovka and Dyachkino communities amid the drone attack. Ukraine routinely strikes Russian oil bases and weapons depots in an attempt to diminish Russia&apos;s fighting power in its war against Ukraine. Ukrainian strikes have targeted weapons storage facilities, military bases, and oil depots in Rostov Oblast in an attempt to slow Russian advances in Eastern Ukraine and pressure Russians to call for an end to the war. Ukrainian drones previously struck the FDKU Atlas oil facility in August, a military intelligence (HUR) source confirmed to the Kyiv Independent. In recent months Ukraine has tried to move Russia&apos;s war away from its own territory, striking targets deeper inside Russia. On Oct. 31, a Ukrainian drone struck an oil refinery in the city of Ufa in Russia&apos;s Bashkortostan Republic, which lies some 1,500 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border. Fossil fuels are the primary drivers of the Russian economy and the main source of revenue for the Kremlin&apos;s war machine. Despite Western sanctions, Russia still provides oil and gas to other countries around the world, primarily India and China.	https://kyivindependent.com/local-media-reports-oil-depot-burning-in-rostov-oblast-following-ukrainian-strike/	2024-11-28T19:57:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/1-3.jpeg
Boris Johnson calls for British, European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of potential peace deal	In an interview with The Telegraph&apos;s Ukraine: The Latest podcast on Nov. 28, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that any possible ceasefire should involve a European peacekeeping mission including British forces to defend the front line. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think we should be sending in combat troops to take on the Russians,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;But I think as part of the solution, as part of the end state, you&#x2019;re going to want to have multinational European peace-keeping forces monitoring the border, helping the Ukrainians.&quot; Following Donald Trump&apos;s 2024 election victory, world leaders are preparing for an abrupt shift in the United States&apos; policy on Ukraine. Much is unknown about Trump&apos;s plans for Ukraine. Trump has promised to end the war in &quot;24 hours&quot; and has called for peace talks, prompting many world leaders to discuss potential outcomes. The Telegraph reported on Nov. 7, citing three Trump staffers, that Trump may call on British and European troops to enforce a buffer zone that he would try to impose over the current front line in Ukraine as part of a possible peace plan. Johnson, a supporter of Trump, said during his interview that he &quot;cannot see that such a European operation could possibly happen without the British,&quot; said. &quot;We need to be spelling out what kind of security guarantees we think are appropriate,&quot; Johnson added. Johnson&apos;s comments on the potential presence of combat troops in Ukraine came after the French outlet Le Monde reported that the U.K. and France have been discussing deploying soldiers or private defense contractors in Ukraine following President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy later said on Nov. 26 that London is not planning to deploy its military personnel on the ground in Ukraine. During the interview, the former prime minister said the United Kingdom is &quot;morally responsible&quot; for Ukraine as a signatory of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. The agreement obliged Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons and demilitarize, a move that has failed to protect Ukraine from Russian aggression. &quot;The only thing that really works is a Nato Article 5 guarantee that has kept the peace in Europe for 80 years,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;It&#x2019;s the reason the Baltic states are in NATO. It&#x2019;s the reason that the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Finns and the Swedes are now in NATO.&quot; A staunch supporter of Ukraine, Johnson previously said that extending NATO membership to Ukraine is the only solution, and it has to be done, as the only long-term solution that provides peace and stability. Despite Ukraine&apos;s ongoing challenges in securing an invitation from a NATO country to join the military alliance, Johnson said that Western allies would need to make clear what potential security guarantees would be offered to Kyiv as part of any peace agreement. As the war drags on past 1,000 days, Johnson&apos;s comment on peace negotiations reflect those made by Ukrainian officials over the past year. Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said in May that Ukraine &quot;clearly understands&quot; that Russia&apos;s full-scale war will end with negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky has more recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration.	https://kyivindependent.com/boris-johnson-calls-for-british-peacekeepers-in-ukraine/	2024-11-28T18:51:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1242687211.jpg
Russian soldiers suspected of executing 4 more Ukrainian POWs near Pokrovsk	Four unarmed Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) were apparently shot and killed by Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast earlier this November, adding to the five previously reported executions of Ukrainian soldiers, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 28. According to the statement, Russian troops captured four Ukrainian defenders during an assault in the Pokrovsk sector on Nov. 22. After forcing the soldiers to surrender, Russian forces are said to have shot them with automatic weapons. In total nine Ukrainian POWs were executed by Russia in the village of Petrivka. It was not immediately clear if the two reported executions are directly connected, or whether they occurred at the same time. &quot;The deliberate killing of prisoners of war constitutes a blatant violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a grave international crime,&quot; the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said in a statement. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Last week, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported two other Ukrainian POWs killed by Russian troops in the Pokrovsk sector. Ahead of the most recent reported cases, law enforcement officers previously said they were investigating 53 criminal proceedings over the executions of 177 Ukrainian soldiers, while 37 proceedings of 109 executions were registered in 2024 alone, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-suspected-of-executing-4-more-ukrainian-pows-near-pokrovsk/	2024-11-28T17:39:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1576124699.jpg
Russian lawyer sentenced to 7 years in prison for publicly speaking out against Ukraine war, media reports	A Russian court has sentenced prominent lawyer Dmitry Talantov to seven years in prison for criticizing the war in Ukraine on social media, according to the Russian independent monitoring group OVD-Info. Talantov, 63, was arrested in June 2022 and has been behind bars for over two years. He was convicted of inciting hatred and spreading what Russian law enforcement called &quot;false information&quot; about the Russian military, offenses introduced under a 2022 law that criminalizes public dissent against the war. Talantov, who once chaired the regional lawyers&apos; association in Udmurtia, was accused of posting several social media comments condemning Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In a letter from detention, Talantov explained his actions: &quot;I once looked at a photo of a maimed Ukrainian woman and decided that I can&#x2019;t stay silent anymore. But I remained a lawyer. I published my opinion in a way that doesn&#x2019;t violate the formalistic law. And you know what? It is not my problem that a normal act is perceived by someone as a crime.&quot; The court in Zavyalovo, Udmurtia, found him guilty and handed down the seven-year sentence on Nov. 28. OVD-Info reports that over 1,100 people have been implicated in criminal cases related to anti-war expressions since the invasion began, with 340 currently incarcerated or involuntarily committed to medical institutions. Before his arrest, Talantov had been a longtime chair of Udmurtia&#x2019;s Chamber of Lawyers and was involved in defending former journalist Ivan Safronov, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2022 for exposing military incidents and arms deals.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-lawyer-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-for-publicly-speaking-out-against-ukraine-war/	2024-11-28T15:41:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182851233.jpg
Russia's drone attack damages children's medical center in Kyiv, injuries reported	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces launched attack drones targeting Kyiv, among other regions, on the evening of Nov. 28. Air defense systems shot down the drones, but debris caused structural damage in several areas of the city, according to officials. Several explosions were heard in different parts of the capital overnight on Nov. 29. In the Dniprovskyi district, drone debris caused a fire on the facade of a children&apos;s medical center. The blaze, which damaged the building&apos;s exterior, shattered windows and uprooted nearby trees, was later extinguished. A security guard was injured by the falling wreckage, according to the mayor. In the Sviatoshynskyi district, drone debris struck an infrastructure facility, Klitschko reported. Officials did not provide other details at the time of the publication. Klitschko urged residents to remain in shelters, while air defense operations were still active as of 1 a.m. local time.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-drone-attack-damages-childrens-medical-center-in-kyiv-injuries-reported/	2024-11-28T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-28-16_08_50.jpeg
Foreign Ministry says Kyiv discusses mobilization strategy with partners, calls on faster military aid	Ukraine has urged its international partners to expedite the delivery of critical military equipment, emphasizing that quicker aid is more crucial than drafting additional personnel. With manpower shortages posing a challenge, Ukraine continues to balance domestic and international expectations while focusing on strengthening its forces on the battlefield. &quot;We are now in the situation when we need more equipment to arm all the people that have already been mobilized, and we think the first priority is to send quicker, faster military aid,&quot; Heorhii Tykhyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine&apos;s foreign ministry, said on Nov. 28 during a press briefing in Kyiv. Tykhyi noted that Ukraine&#x2019;s mobilization strategy is regularly discussed with international allies alongside other key topics, including defense strategy and sanctions on Russia. He dismissed suggestions of tension over the issue. &quot;I can confirm that this topic is being discussed at negotiations. I can refute that this is a point of tension or that it&apos;s being discussed in a critical or negative manner,&quot; he said. President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the issue during a Nov. 19 parliamentary session, presenting a 10-point plan to bolster internal resilience. Zelensky ruled out lowering the mobilization age despite facing pressure from citizens and U.S. lawmakers to do so. Instead, he proposed reforms, including new management strategies, the creation of a military ombudsman, and a contract system for citizens below the mobilization age.	https://kyivindependent.com/foreign-ministry-says-kyiv-discusses-mobilization-strategy-with-partners-calls-on-faster-military-aid/	2024-11-28T13:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2105335403.jpg
Can Russia sustain its war effort as ruble plummets, inflation soars?	With the purchasing power of the Russian ruble hitting the lowest point since March 2022, the economic toll of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine becomes glaring. Russia&apos;s expanding spending on the war has fueled inflation, prompting Russia&apos;s Central Bank to hike interest rates to the highest level since the early 2000s &#x2014; 21 percent &#x2014; to rein in consumer prices. Inflation remained high regardless of the rate hike, speeding up to over 1 percent in the first three weeks of November and pushing the year-to-year numbers to over 8 percent. In the wake of the economic challenges the country has faced over the past year, the U.S. government&apos;s Nov. 21 decision to impose new sanctions on dozens of Russian banks has proven hard for the country&apos;s economy to swallow. &quot;Russia is currently facing an impossible economic conundrum because of the rapid increase in military expenditures and the Western sanctions,&quot; Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist specializing in post-Soviet countries, told the Kyiv Independent. However, economists and analysts are divided on how much of an impact Russia&apos;s economic problems will have on its war effort. Some argue that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Russia to finance its war. &quot;Undaunted by economic reality, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is raising defense and security costs to officially $176 billion in 2025, 41 percent of the federal budget expenditures,&quot; &#xA0;Aslund said. &quot;Yet, Russia can only finance 2 percent of GDP in budget deficit a year ($40 billion) because its only reserve is the National Wealth Fund,&quot; he said. &quot;At the end of March 2024, its liquid resources amounted to a mere $55 billion. Nobody lends money to Russia.&quot; But others say that, despite all the economic difficulties, the Kremlin will have enough resources to finance the war for a long time at the expense of cutting spending on the country&apos;s civilian sector. Sergei Aleksashenko, a Russian-born economist based in the U.S., said that &quot;Putin&apos;s economic problems shouldn&apos;t be overestimated.&quot; &quot;He will spend as much money on the war as necessary,&quot; he said. Even so, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s team has shown openness to a potential plan to dramatically increase oil output and drive down oil prices, on which Russia&apos;s economy is heavily dependent. As a result, the Kremlin may be in for a bumpy ride. &quot;2025 will be a moment of truth,&quot; Vladimir Milov, a Russian opposition politician who was an economic advisor for the Russian government in the early 2000s, told the Kyiv Independent. Central Bank between rock and hard placeDue to constant increases in military spending, Russia&apos;s budget deficit amounted to 3.2 trillion rubles ($30 billion) in 2023 and is expected to amount to 3.1 trillion rubles ($29 billion) in 2024. Since 2023, inflation has been speeding up due to the same reason &#x2014; from 2.3 percent year-on-year in April 2023 to 8.2 percent in November 2024. Inflation contributed to the decreasing purchasing power of the ruble, which fell to 108 per dollar on Nov. 28, the lowest level since March 2022. One of the latest blows to the ruble&apos;s value was the U.S. government&apos;s Nov. 21 decision to sanction dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, which handles oil and gas payments. To rein in accelerating inflation, Russia&apos;s Central Bank has been raising the interest rate &#x2014; from 7.5 percent in July 2023 to 21 percent in October 2024. The tight monetary policy of Elvira Nabiullina, the central bank&apos;s chief, has prompted a backlash from businesses, including those involved in the military industrial complex. Sergei Chemezov, CEO of state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec, has lashed out at the Central Bank repeatedly. &quot;If we continue working this way, most enterprises will essentially go bankrupt,&quot; he said in October. &quot;The question today is this: either we cease all high-tech exports &#x2014; airplanes, air defense systems, ships, and so on, which require production timelines of a year or more &#x2014; or we need to take some measures.&quot; Elvira Nabiullina, head of the country&apos;s Central Bank, in Saint Petersburg, Russia on July 5, 2024. (Maksim Konstantinov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)A man walks past the Russian Central Bank headquarters in downtown Moscow, Russia on Sep. 6, 2023. (Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images)Opposition politician Milov said that Chemezov and Nabiullina &quot;are both right&quot; in their own way. &quot;Chemezov is right that businesses will have to shut down at such a (high interest) rate,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent, &quot;Nabiullina is right that the rate cannot be cut because in that case there will be hyperinflation like in Turkey.&quot; He continued that &quot;there is only one way out &#x2014; finish the war and withdraw Russian troops&quot; from Ukraine. &quot;Nabiullina is in a tough spot because of the spending on the war,&quot; Torbj&#xF6;rn Becker, director of the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics and a co-author of a recent report on the Russian wartime economy, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The whole war effort is creating a headache for Nabiullina. The military-industrial complex wants to spend more money. The military guys don&apos;t care about macroeconomic stability.&quot; Is Russia headed for stagflation?The Central Bank&apos;s policy of making credit more expensive may be contributing to a slowdown in economic growth. Russia&apos;s gross domestic product rose 3.6 percent in 2023 amid a boom fueled by military spending, according to the State Statistics Service (RosStat). Russia&apos;s economy is expected to grow by 3.5-4 percent in 2024, but the growth is expected to slow down to 0.5-1.5 percent in 2025, according to Russia&apos;s Central Bank. &quot;There are no new investments, and the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus is decreasing,&quot; Milov said. &quot;(Economic growth) is also being killed by high inflation and the Central Bank&apos;s high rate. Credit is unbelievably expensive.&quot; Milov believes that Russia&apos;s GDP may fall in 2025, and the country may experience stagflation &#x2014; a combination of stagnation and high inflation. Alexandra Prokopenko, an economic expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, argued that &quot;it&apos;s not stagflation yet, but Russia is close.&quot; &quot;Recent data suggests that the overheated Russian economy is starting to cool,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This includes a fall in retail lending, slowing wage increases, and dropping industrial growth. However, it shouldn&apos;t be overstated. Despite the signs of cooling, the fundamental drivers of overheating remain in place &#x2014; growing military production and an intense labor shortage.&quot; She added that &quot;in some sectors related to the military (like, for example, finished metal products and optics and computers), there is no sign of any cooling.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Uralvagonzavod, a Russian tank factory, in Nizhny Tagil, Russia on Feb. 15, 2024. (Alexander Kazakov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)Yulia Pavytska, an economic expert at the Kyiv School of Economics&apos; think-tank, KSE Institute, told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;the current policy of the Russian Central Bank will either lead to stagnation &#x2014; the absence of economic growth &#x2014; or the regulator will fail, in which case inflation will continue to rise.&quot; She added, however, that &quot;a combination of stagnation and inflation is currently an unlikely scenario, given the continued fiscal stimulus in the form of war-related expenditures and the significant labor market deficit.&quot; Aleksashenko said that he did not expect a drop in Russia&apos;s GDP in 2025. He told the Kyiv Independent that labor market shortages were slowing down economic growth but their impact was relatively small. Higher inflation on the horizon?Some analysts predict that pressure from industry, including the military-industrial complex, will lead to Nabiullina&apos;s downfall. &quot;Putin understands that Nabiullina is useful but there is more and more pressure from security forces,&quot; Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;In this struggle, the military-industrial complex will inevitably win because Putin is waging a war.&quot; Aslund agreed, saying that &quot;Chemezov and other industrialists will oust her very soon and make the correct point that high interest rates solve none of the (Central Bank&apos;s) tasks, which would be correct, but they will push for lower interest rates, which will aggravate the situation.&quot; &quot;Inflation will rise, the capital outflow will accelerate, and the exchange rate will fall,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Aslund also said that he &quot;would not suggest hyperinflation (over 50 percent increase a month) but a substantial increase in inflation, which will cause popular dissatisfaction.&quot; Andrei Movchan, a Russian-born economist and founder of Movchan&apos;s Group, told the Kyiv Independent that, if the Central Bank changes its policy and cuts its rate by several percentage points, inflation could rise to 20-25 percent but it would not lead to a &quot;catastrophe&quot; or &quot;destruction of the economy.&quot; Although economists agree that Russia is experiencing economic difficulties, they are split on whether they will make its war effort unsustainable. Aslund said that &quot;Russia&apos;s macroeconomic failures will become a critical factor next year, perhaps rather soon, though these things are always difficult to time.&quot; Anders Olofsg&#xE5;rd, a deputy director at the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics, shares these thoughts. He told the Kyiv Independent that &quot;it is becoming increasingly expensive for Russia to finance the war, with domestic military production at capacity, inflation and wages surging, and them increasingly turning to allies such as Iran and North Korea for military equipment and even soldiers.&quot; &quot;They are also gradually depleting the external reserves they have, and the worse the economic situation, the more they need to turn to those reserves to afford the expansion in military expenditures,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, this doesn&apos;t mean that they will run out of money tomorrow, but depending on oil and gas prices, the effectiveness and enforcement of sanctions, and the competence and credibility of their macroeconomic policies, that day is coming.&quot; Milov said that there is less and less money at Russia&apos;s Federal Wealth Fund, and it&apos;s difficult for the government to borrow at such a high interest rate. The government has tried to raise money by increasing taxes but the &quot;tax hikes will accelerate the slowing down of the economy and reduce the tax base,&quot; Milov continued. &quot;They&apos;ll have to decide something because they can&apos;t wage such a high-intensity war anymore,&quot; he added. Milov said that the production of more primitive military products &#x2014; such as drones, bombs, and artillery shells &#x2014; is expanding. However, it is more difficult for Russia to produce more complex equipment &#x2014; tanks, armored vehicles and aircraft, he added. Other economists are more cautious. &quot;Russia is currently not facing serious fiscal challenges,&quot; Pavytska said. &quot;It is likely that the Finance Ministry will be able to execute this year&apos;s budget as planned.&quot; She said that domestic borrowing would be &quot;costly,&quot; but the government would take this step if needed because &quot;the regime needs money for the war now, not in some abstract future.&quot; &quot;In modern Russian realities, the key interest rate is, de facto, irrelevant to the regime,&quot; Pavytska added. &quot;Funds for the war will be found in any case, including by cutting other expenditures, as evidenced by the draft budget for next year, or through monetary issuance.&quot; Movchan and Aleksashenko said that the defense sector gets direct funding from the budget, not loans, and it would be funded regardless of high interest rates. They argued that Russia&apos;s economic difficulties were not affecting its war effort. Movchan said that Russia would start experiencing problems with funding the war only if oil prices fell significantly, leading to a major drop in the government&apos;s foreign currency earnings. He added, however, that he believed that a major fall in oil prices was unlikely in the near future. The hope for a drop in oil prices was boosted recently by Trump&apos;s plan to issue more permits to drastically increase U.S. oil and liquefied natural gas production. Reuters reported on Nov. 25 that Trump&apos;s transition team was working on the plan and would roll it out within days of him taking office in January. Oreshkin said that Russia&apos;s current economic turmoil is unlikely to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s hand in potential peace talks. But, if Trump manages to drive down oil prices and cracks down on Russia&apos;s evasion of oil sanctions, Ukraine will have a stronger position, he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/will-russias-economic-problems-make-its-war-unsustainable/	2024-11-28T12:53:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1259146472.jpg
‘It’s excruciating’ – Ukrainians describe surviving Russian attacks that cost them health, loved ones, and homes	WARNING: This article contains descriptions of graphic scenes. Anna Kotova was chatting with her sister on a video call, admiring her image on the screen. It was her 19th birthday, and for the first time in a while, she was feeling good about how she looked. &#x201C;I used to dye my hair a lot, and then I realized my natural hair had grown out, and I liked it so much. I had long eyelashes, and I looked so good,&#x201D; Kotova recalls. &#xA0; Then, in an instant, everything went dark. &#x201C;The missile hit right after I thought that.&#x201D; It was Jan. 14, 2023, the day when Russia unleashed one of its deadliest attacks on Ukraine, striking an apartment building in Dnipro and killing 46 people. &quot;I didn&apos;t see or hear anything, like the missile flying&#x2026; There was none of that,&#x201D; Kotova says. &#x201C;At some point, I felt that I was thrown back, and that was it. My brain just stopped working. I don&apos;t remember anything at all, just darkness.&quot; Kotova was among the 79 people injured in the strike. She lost one eye and endured numerous operations to remove all the shards of glass from her body. She is currently receiving laser treatment to minimize the scars left on her face and body.

(Mykola Miakshykov / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Psychologists say that, like Kotova, the thousands of Ukrainians who have survived brutal Russian attacks since Feb. 24, 2022 have been left not just with lasting scars on their bodies, but long-term damage to their mental health from the trauma of their experiences. And their number is steadily growing, as Russian attacks have been wounding civilians almost every day since the start of the full-scale war. For Kotova, the day the Russian Kh-22 missile destroyed her home split her life into &#x201C;before and after,&#x201D; with no possibility of a return to the way things were before. Anna Kotova in an undated photo. (Personal Archive)&#x201C;You live one day at a time because you are still scared of what tomorrow might bring,&#x201D; Kotova told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;You also didn&#x2019;t expect that it would happen then, that a missile would hit your house, that it would happen to you, and that you would suffer such injuries.&#x201D; &#xA0; &#x201C;When I lived in Dnipro, I stopped reacting to the air raid alarms over time. If it hits, it hits. But back then, I just couldn&apos;t imagine the consequences.&#x201D; Kotova and her boyfriend had moved to Dnipro from now-occupied Sievierodonetsk in Luhansk Oblast on the very day the full-scale invasion began. They rented a spacious apartment with their friends. However, when their friends relocated to another city, the couple began searching for a smaller place. They never found one. &#x201C;On the morning of Jan. 14, everything started very well,&#x201D; Kotova recalls. &#x201C;I woke up to flowers and a new phone, and everything was wonderful. I couldn&apos;t have imagined something so horrible could happen after just a few hours.&#x201D; The explosion occurred around 3 p.m., as Kotova and her boyfriend were preparing to host some guests. Shortly after the blast, Kotova&#x2019;s boyfriend found her on the kitchen floor. He told her he could not see her eyes and her whole face, only blood and glass shards. &#x201C;I remember that when I touched my face with a towel, it felt like minced meat. There was nothing left. It was so slippery and unrecognizable,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I started to panic and asked, &apos;Is this my face?&apos; My boyfriend told me not to touch anything and that everything would be fine. I fell silent and didn&apos;t say anything else.&#x201D; Anna Kotova after Russian attack on Dnipro in an undated photo. (Personal Archive)As they escaped the building, they were able to see the scale of the attack and realized how lucky they had been to survive: &#x201C;I heard people&apos;s screams, sirens, and loud noises. I remember that it was very frightening,&#x201D; Kotova says. But for her, the most challenging part was yet to begin. She was taken to a local hospital, where doctors placed her in a coma and performed surgery. &#x201C;I woke up on the 15th or 16th (of January). I tried to move, but a doctor came up to me and told me that they had removed my eye&#x2026;&#x201D; she says tearfully. &#x201C;I had a breakdown. I couldn&apos;t breathe on my own, couldn&apos;t swallow or talk, and tears started to flow&#x2026; I couldn&#x2019;t see anything; I was just lying there, realizing &#x2026; I no longer had one eye.&#x201D; Numerous other operations, lengthy treatments, and the fitting of eye prosthetics in Austria followed. Kotova currently resides in Czechia but often travels to Kyiv for laser treatment. With time, she has learned to look at herself in the mirror without crying, but she cannot forget that horrible January strike. Her 20th birthday this year, naturally coinciding with the attack&#x2019;s anniversary, was one of her hardest days. Anna Kotova (L) and her boyfriend (R) in an undated photo. (Personal Archive)&#x201C;I knew I was in Czechia, and it was safe there. But I still had this fear that it would happen again.&#x201D; &#x201C;(Shortly after the attack) I simply didn&#x2019;t want to continue treatment. I didn&#x2019;t understand how much more there was to endure or why it happened to me. I thought that maybe it would have been better if I had stayed (meaning died) in that house and not suffered further,&#x201D; Kotova says. &#x201C;(But) I (have come to) truly value life because when you are on the brink of losing it, you hold on to everything you can to ensure it doesn&#x2019;t happen again.&#x201D; In mid-October 2022, Ukrainian soldier Viktor Hanych left the front lines to spend a short vacation with his parents in Kyiv. It was the first time in a while that Hanych, who voluntarily joined the military shortly after the invasion started, had seen his parents. The whole family first gathered at Hanych&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2019;s home before returning to his parents&#x2019; cozy apartment on Zhylianska Street in Kyiv. They talked about &#x201C;everything in the world&#x201D; and soon fell asleep, tired but happy to be together again, Hanych recalls. &#x201C;I woke up to a couple of explosions and quickly told (my parents) to get ready to go to the shelter,&#x201D; he says, adding that they did not hear the air raid siren that night, and his parents usually reacted to them. &#x201C;They had an (underground) parking area right near the house where they hid from attacks,&#x201D; he says. Hanych was the first one to leave the apartment. He told his parents he would hold the door for them and wait outside. He also recalls being very calm, as he was used to explosions while fighting in embattled Kherson and Donetsk oblasts. Just as he reached the first floor, the building was hit by a Russian drone. &#x201C;It landed right in their apartment,&#x201D; Hanych says. &#x201C;As a soldier, I realized what had happened. But the hardest part was the waiting.&#x201D; Although the attack occurred in the early morning, Hanych only identified the bodies of his parents at around 2 p.m. that day. Viktor Hanych in an undated photo. (Personal Archive)It was the day Russia launched its first-ever attack on Kyiv using Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones. Apart from Hanych&#x2019;s parents, the bodies of two more civilians, including a six-month pregnant woman, were found under the rubble of the apartment building. &#x201C;If it wasn&#x2019;t for my comrades&apos; support&#x2026;&#x201D; Hanych says, adding that he had felt a &#x201C;thirst for revenge&#x201D; but was thankfully stopped by his fellow soldiers. After participating in fierce battles near now-occupied Bakhmut, Hanych returned to civilian life to care for his grandmother. To this day, he tries to avoid going to Zhylianska Street, where his parents&#x2019; home once stood. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s excruciating,&#x201D; Hanych says. &#x201C;I think those who experience something similar become fatalists but also begin to cherish and love this life even more. I felt exactly that.&#x201D; The four-room apartment in Sumy was the setting for decades of sorrow and joy in the lives of resident Diana Nazarevska and her family. But now it is gone, destroyed in a Russian attack. &#x201C;It was my grandmother&apos;s apartment. My mother grew up there, and later, when I was about three years old, we moved there with my parents,&#x201D; Nazarevska, 28, says. &#x201C;It was also where I started building my own family with my husband.&#x201D; &#x201C;That apartment held the memories of my family, of my father, when he was still alive.&#x201D; On March 13, Nazarevska, her husband, and their baby daughter slept peacefully when an explosion woke them up. &#x41F;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x442;&#x440;&#x435;&#x442;&#x44C; &#x44D;&#x442;&#x443; &#x43F;&#x443;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x446;&#x438;&#x44E; &#x432; Instagram &#x41F;&#x443;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x446;&#x438;&#x44F; &#x43E;&#x442; Diana Nazarevska (@diasya.nazarevskaya) &#x201C;It was the first Shahed drone targeting the residential building, but it was shot down and flew past it. I picked up my daughter, and we lay close to the wall,&#x201D; Nazarevska recalls. Then, she heard another drone approaching. &#x201C;I grabbed my child, stood up, and didn&#x2019;t even have time to run anywhere&#x2026; I just realized that there was an explosion in our house.&#x201D; &#x201C;Then I started shouting for my husband, asking if he was alive. He slept very soundly and didn&apos;t understand what had happened at first.&#x201D; Amid the terrifying chaos, the family grabbed some documents, dressed their baby, and fled the apartment. As her husband opened the door to the hallway, Nazarevska was confronted with the &#x201C;stench of burning and the smell of damp concrete,&#x201D; which she says would likely &#x201C;remain in her memory forever.&#x201D; Rescuers stand near a dead body that was pulled from under the rubble in Sumy, Ukraine on March 14, 2024. (Oleh Voronenko/Suspilne Ukraine/JSC &quot;UA:PBC&quot;/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Outside, as she saw her beloved home in ruins and fire, she also witnessed her neighbors desperately searching for their loved ones in the rubble. &#x201C;I will always remember how my neighbor&#x2019;s father came running and shouting, &#x2018;Vika!&#x2019;&#x201D; Nazarevska says, her voice trembling. &#x201C;It was the shout you hear when someone is on the verge of hysteria. He kept screaming, but no one answered him. He shouted again, and still, no one responded.&#x201D; That night, Russia killed three people and injured 14. It also forever altered Nazarevska&#x2019;s life, teaching her how fragile existence can be and how important it is to cherish every moment, even amid war. &#xA0; &#x201C;But we no longer have a home,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;And it&#x2019;s not just about the walls but the loss of a sense of basic security. For people, home generally means safety. It&#x2019;s the place you go where you know everything will be okay.&#x201D; &#x201C;Unfortunately, that sense of security is lost now.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-describe-surviving-russian-attacks/	2024-11-28T12:33:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1458716680.jpg
Putin wants to escalate' before Trump takes office — Zelensky hits back at Oreshnik threats	Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to escalate the war in Ukraine so that U.S. President Donald Trump fails to end the full-scale war, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 28. Zelensky&apos;s comments come in response to Putin&apos;s fresh threats to target &quot;decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv and Ukrainian military facilities with Oreshnik, Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). &quot;(Putin) is aiming to disrupt the efforts of President Trump that are sure to come after his inauguration,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;Putin wants to escalate the situation now so that President Trump fails to end the war.&quot; Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) summit in Astana earlier in the day, Putin said that Russia&apos;s military leadership is now &quot;choosing targets&quot; in Ukraine to hit them with Oreshnik. Zelensky called Putin&apos;s actions &quot;pressure&quot; to force Trump to accept Russia&apos;s terms. On the campaign trail, Trump has criticized military support provided to Ukraine by Joe Biden&apos;s administration and pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. While the details of his plans remain elusive, some reports indicate this would entail forcing Ukraine to cede territory and at least temporarily give up on its NATO accession plans. Russia first launched Oreshnik in an attack against the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon,&quot; which later was refuted by Zelensky. Russia&apos;s Oreshnik attack followed Kyiv&apos;s first successful strike on a military target on Russian soil using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The Russian Defense Ministry admitted more such strikes against targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts had followed later.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-hits-back-at-putins-oreshnik-threats/	2024-11-28T12:10:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389-1.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia's large-scale attack strikes a 'massive blow' at Ukraine's energy system	Key developments on Nov. 28: Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack against Ukraine on the morning of Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure across the country, including the far-western regions. Russian forces launched more than 180 drones and missiles at Ukraine, successfully hitting 12 sites of fuel and energy infrastructure, according to the Air Force. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; at Ukraine&apos;s power grid. Emergency blackouts were introduced in multiple regions across Ukraine. The Air Force announced a nationwide air raid alert after warning that seven Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers took off. Explosions were reported in multiple cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Lutsk, and Rivne. Local officials also reported strikes in Sumy, Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, and Volyn oblasts. Ukrainian forces shot down 79 out of the 91 missiles and 35 out of the 97 drones, launched by Russian forces, the Air Force reported. Over 60 more drones were countered by the means of electronic warfare. Fragments of a downed Russian Kh-55 missile in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 28, 2024. (State Emergency Service)Russia has already begun redoubling attacks on Ukraine&apos;s power grid as the country enters its third winter at war. Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine&apos;s Presidential Office, said on Nov. 28 that Russia was deliberately stockpiling weapons, including arms from North Korea, in order to launch mass attacks on cities and infrastructure in winter. &quot;They stockpiled missiles for strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure, for warfare against civilians during the cold, during the winter,&quot; Yermak said. Ukraine destroyed a Russian high-value radar station, 48Y6-K1 Podlet, near the village of Kotovske in occupied Crimea on Nov. 28, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported. While no further details have been disclosed, HUR claimed to be behind the operation. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t verify the claim. Podlet is a modern mobile radar system designed to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes. The system has an estimated price tag of around $5 million. The news comes after multiple explosions were reported across Crimea with Russian proxies claiming to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones. The Netherlands delivered three new Patriot air defense launchers to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans announced on Nov. 28. &quot;This saves lives and protects vital infrastructure. It is and remains in our common interest to stop Russian aggression,&quot; Brekelmans said on social media. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities ahead of winter. Russia launched nearly 100 drones and 90 missiles against Ukraine overnight on Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure. Additional emergency blackouts were introduced across the country following the attack. &quot;I am grateful to Minister Brekelmans and the Dutch government for strengthening Ukrainian air defense capabilities,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Washington&apos;s decision to allow Kyiv to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia has not increased the risk of a nuclear attack, Reuters reported on Nov. 27, citing five unnamed sources familiar with the intelligence data. The news comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin updated the nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19, and Russian government officials continue to criticize the recent White House decision, calling it a push for &quot;escalation.&quot; Despite the Kremlin&apos;s recent statements, the risk of a nuclear attack is unlikely, Reuters reported, citing its unidentified sources. Intelligence assessments over the past seven months have shown that a nuclear escalation is unlikely to result from a decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. weapons. &quot;The assessments were consistent: The ATACMS weren&apos;t going to change Russia&#x2019;s nuclear calculus,&quot; said one congressional aide briefed on the intelligence. Meanwhile, Moscow is expected to expand its campaign of sabotage against European facilities to increase pressure on the West for its support of Kyiv, two high-ranking officials, a lawmaker, and two congressional aides told the news agency. One of the five U.S. officials also noted that unveiling the new missile, referring to the Russian-made Oreshnik, is a step toward escalation. U.S. officials said the intelligence helped guide the contentious debate within the Joe Biden administration over whether Washington should ease restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. weapons because of the risk of provoking Putin. Russian troops operated a torture chamber in Belarus in the spring of 2022, the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC) reported on Nov. 28. Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians abducted from Ukraine were reportedly held there. The chamber was located on Belarusian government-owned property in the town of Naroulia, not far from the border with Ukraine, according to BIC. The Russian military has reportedly set up a camp in Naroulia for people captured in Kyiv Oblast during the early stages of the full-scale war. In comments to BIC, human rights activists described the Naroulia camp as a place where the treatment of civilian hostages &#x201C;was among the most brutal.&#x201D; Lawyer Yulia Polekhina, working with the Sich human rights group, said that prisoners were tortured there. Polekhina&#x2019;s words echo those of former prisoners who went through Naroulia. &#x201C;They beat up civilians there really hard. One could hear constant screaming there,&#x201D; said Bohdan Lysenko, a soldier with the Ukrainian Armed Forces who was captured by the Russian military and brought to the camp in March 2022, in a comment to BIC. According to the investigation, the camp was located in the compound owned by Pripyatski Alyans on Kamsamolskaya Street. Owned by the Belarusian state, the company conducts catering and food procurement for regional institutions. The company did not comment on the allegations and advised to contact local authorities for more information. The Reckoning Project, the Ukrainian-American organization that records human rights violations, suggests that the actions of the Russian military in Naroulia may indicate a violation of the Geneva Convention provisions, which prohibit forced displacement of civilians and ban keeping military personnel and civilians at the same detention center. The Russian military was reportedly present at the location at least until early May 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-45/	2024-11-28T11:59:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-28_10-56-15.jpg
Zelensky signs law on 'historic' tax increase	President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law a bill authorizing a major tax increase on Nov. 28, following more than a month of delay. The bill, which was passed by the Ukrainian parliament on Oct. 10, will raise taxes by Hr 8 billion ($192,000) in 2024 and Hr 141 billion ($3.4 billion) in 2025, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said, as the country struggles to shore up its budget deficit amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale war. The law is expected to come into effect on Dec. 1. One of the provisions of the bill is an increase of the military tax &#x2014; a sum levied from citizens to support the war effort &#x2014; from 1.5% to 5%. An amendment to the legislation left the military tax for military personnel at 1.5%. The bill also introduces a military tax for self-employed persons and increases profit taxes for banks to 50% for 2024 and other financial institutions from 18% to 25% since January next year. Zelensky also signed a bill on the state budget for 2025, passed by the parliament on Nov. 19. All taxes of citizens and businesses will be directed to Ukraine&apos;s defense and security, according to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. The state expects to get Hr 2 trillion ($48.2 billion) in revenues, while expenditures are planned at Hr 3.6 trillion ($86.8 billion) in 2025. The budget envisages spending Hr 2.2 trillion ($53 billion) on Ukraine&apos;s defense, which is 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP). Shmyhal said in August that Ukraine faces a budget deficit of $35 billion next year, though foreign partners have pledged to cover roughly $20 billion of that sum. The proposed tax increase is part of an effort to find additional sources of funding at home, which may also include increased domestic borrowing and measures to boost the number of jobs and wages. Despite the dire budgetary situation, the bill has received criticism due to its potential repercussions on already difficult living conditions in the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-signs-law-2/	2024-11-28T11:15:32-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/volodymyr_zelenskiy_32.jpg
Ukraine’s fight against Russian invasion undermined by draft-dodging graft	Heavy fighting on the front lines of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, dragging out for almost three years, has left thousands of Ukrainian soldiers seriously injured or killed in action. Many still fighting for years along more than 600 miles of the front line in Ukraine&#x2019;s east and south are exhausted as they face what Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces, describes as &#x201C;one of the most powerful Russian offensives.&#x201D; Earlier this year, the government stepped up mobilization to increase the army&#x2019;s ranks by hundreds of thousands, on top of the more than 1 million currently defending the country. Yet, the effort to scale up Ukrainian forces against an enemy with more manpower and weaponry has been tainted by mushrooming corruption scandals. Officials in the Ukrainian healthcare system are suspected of taking bribes to help men avoid mobilization by obtaining fake disability documents through MSEC, the state medical commission responsible for clearing men to be fit to fight. &#x201C;From a human perspective, what jerks,&#x201D; a Ukrainian Special Forces sniper who goes by the callsign Bart told the Kyiv Independent, responding to the alleged corrupt schemes aiding draft dodgers. &#x201C;We do our job (on the front) because someone has to do it. But there are institutions that must make decisions about (corruption),&#x201D; he added. A series of high-profile MSEC corruption scandals last month triggered public outrage and prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to act. &#x201C;This is truly an internal enemy,&#x201D; Zelensky said in an address in October, days before signing a decree to liquidate the commissions by the end of the year. Officials say a rebooted, digitized system is to replace them. Reports of abuse date back to the early days of Russia&#x2019;s full-blown war launched in 2022, when hundreds of thousands of men motivated to take up arms lined up at army recruitment centers. But the urgency to squash the schemes has mounted after Ukraine has, years into the war, stepped up forceful enlistment tactics.

(Volodymyr Zelensky/Telegram)The planned MSEC reform, to be introduced next year, will also serve as a litmus test of the Zelensky administration&#x2019;s ability to dismantle lingering corruption in state institutions. Success in this broader effort is vital to boosting public morale, as well as reinforcing the struggling front-line units with new recruits. Ukraine&#x2019;s state network of medical commissions, known as MSECs, decide whether the person is disabled and how severe the disability is.&#x200B;&#x200B; During the war, thousands of wounded veterans had to fight a bureaucratic battle for disability status to be eligible for government payments and benefits, overwhelming MSEC, which provided services to about 2.7 million Ukrainians before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion. Soldiers often complained about the commission&#x2019;s time-consuming, outdated, and corrupt system, which required large amounts of paperwork and could take as long as three months to grant status. At the same time, many civilian men sought to be granted a disability status that would exempt them from military service in accordance with Ukrainian law. Since the 1990s, the commissions have worked only with paper documents, unaffected by the state&#x2019;s digitalization campaign that boosted Ukrainian mobilization this year. This allowed doctors and experts to decide on people&#x2019;s disability status with barely any oversight.

(Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)It was also up to MSEC members to set a date for a person to return and get their status reviewed. &#x201C;If you have everything on paper, it is impossible to control it properly,&#x201D; said Liubov Halan, co-founder of Pryncyp, the top veteran care reform organization in Ukraine that advocates for the MSEC overhaul. The lack of oversight allowed some officials in MSEC to embrace a flow of bribes from civilians desperate to avoid military service, which have left a smaller pool of potentially less fit conscripts to draw from. Ukraine&#x2019;s government announced a plan to reform the system in May 2023. Yet, it wasn&#x2019;t until several consecutive scandals in October rattled the nation, prompting officials to move toward ground-breaking changes. &#x201C;Lists of &#x2018;draft dodgers&#x2019; with fake diagnosis&#x201D; were found alongside millions of dollars in cash during the search of the apartment of Tetiana Krupa, the head and chief doctor of Khmelnytskyi Oblast&#x2019;s MSEC, the State Bureau of Investigation reported on Oct. 4. &quot;Law enforcement officers found money in the apartment in almost every corner &#x2014; in wardrobes, drawers, niches,&quot; the Bureau&#x2019;s statement read. Soon after, Ukrainian news outlet Censor.NET published an investigation showing that Krupa granted Khmelnytskyi Oblast Chief prosecutor Oleksiy Oliinyk and scores of his subordinates disability status.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Now at least 51 top prosecutors supposed to guarantee the rule of law in the region are suspected of participating in the draft-dodging graft scheme. Apart from avoiding the draft, the alleged scams helped the officials receive outsized government pensions and other benefits. The Prosecutor General&#x2019;s office launched an internal investigation, which also found that 60 prosecutors, an unusually high number, were registered as people with disabilities in Cherkasy Oblast. In the Khmelnytsky and Cherkasy oblast cases, local MSECs declared almost a third of prosecutors unfit to fight, compared to less than 10% in other regions. According to reports by the Security Service of Ukraine, more MSEC workers have been accused of engaging in draft-dodging corruption schemes every week since. The findings pointed to an institutionalized pattern of these schemes between MSEC and the prosecutor offices in at least two oblasts. Krupa&#x2019;s case was the first public expose of a Ukrainian government official outside the military system making millions in wealth by illegally aiding the draft-dodging during the all-out Russian war. It was also a blatant showcase of inequality between the state officials obtaining disability benefits en masse while many wounded Ukrainian soldiers sat in queues for months to do it. Ukrainians wanted the leadership to react, punish corrupt officials, and introduce reforms to the rotten system. Responding to people&#x2019;s needs, Zelensky ordered the dissolution of medical commissions by the end of the year and, in a statement on Oct. 22, said Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin resigned. The Prosecutor General&#x2019;s office launched an investigation into the prosecutors&#x2019; disability statuses. Krupa was detained, while Ukraine&#x2019;s Health ministry dismissed its top officials in charge of MSEC. &#x201C;The president did the (short-term) tactics right,&#x201D; said anti-corruption activist Vitaly Shabunin, head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center&apos;s executive board. &#x201C;It was necessary to give the public at least the appearance or hope of restoring justice.&#x201D; However, Shabunin and other activists doubt corruption will be eliminated in the system over the long run. Nothing has changed since the corruption scandals in draft offices last year prompted the government to dismiss their heads and promise reforms. &#x201C;The main reform to ensure that there is no corruption in the MSEC is to digitalize the process,&#x201D; Shabunin told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not rocket science,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If this is not resolved again, it means that all these executives are simply incapable of solving these problems.&#x201D; Under Zelensky&#x2019;s presidency, Ukraine has successfully rooted out many layers of choking bureaucracy and room for corruption with reforms that introduced digitization of many public services, most notably through the notorious Diia mobile phone app. Recent efforts to digitize men&apos;s registration as part of the army&#x2019;s mobilization efforts and to provide services to soldiers currently serving have also shown promise. The new digitalization system replacing MSEC is laid out in a reform plan approved by the government on Nov. 20 and was submitted as legislation to parliament to be adopted. The draft law, adopted by lawmakers in a first reading but now awaiting amendments before a final vote, stipulates that current heads of medical commissions are forbidden from participating in expert groups deciding on medical disabilities. The MSEC functions are to be transferred to some regular Ukrainian hospitals.

(Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;The plan has been developed,&#x201D; the Ministry of Digital Transformation said in response to the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s inquiry. According to the ministry, the new digital system will free patients from carrying their paper records around for visits to relevant authorities and prevent corruption, as medical experts and patients will not see each other&#x2019;s names. While the MSEC reform was promised by the government over a year ago, activists are concerned that its politically-motivated rushed implementation could hurt the welfare of people with disabilities. &#x201C;What the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Affairs should do for all persons with disabilities, including veterans, is to change the entire approach,&#x201D; Halan said. &#x201C;It is not clear how it will all happen.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-fight-against-russian-invasion-hurt-by-draft-dodging-graft/	2024-11-28T11:05:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2149272121.jpg
Ukraine maintains 'good dialogue' with potential Trump's peace envoy, Kyiv says	Kyiv maintains &quot;a good dialogue&quot; with retired U.S. General Keith Kellogg, who was nominated for the post of a special Ukraine peace envoy, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said on Nov. 28. &quot;Keith Kellogg is not a new person for Ukraine. The Embassy of Ukraine in the U.S. has maintained close ties with him, in particular within the framework of expert diplomacy in recent years, and has developed and maintained a good dialogue with him during this time,&#x201D; Tykhyi told journalists in Kyiv. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump tapped Kellogg for Ukraine peace envoy on Nov. 27, proposing him as a person who potentially can lead negotiations on an end to Russia&apos;s full-scale war. &quot;We welcome his nomination for this important mission,&quot; Tykhyi said. In June, Reuters reported that Kellogg and another Trump&apos;s top advisor, Frederick H. Fleitz, proposed a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agreed to hold peace negotiations with Russia. The two also reportedly proposed to freeze the front lines in their current position and take Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession off the table. Kellogg, 80, previously served as the executive secretary and chief of staff of the U.S. National Security Council in the first Trump administration. He also was a top advisor to then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. According to the spokesperson, Ukrainian delegations have met with Kellogg on several occasions. Kellogg also was present at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Washington during President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s speech earlier in July. &quot;We are looking forward to working with him, to even more active interaction with him in his new role. We will cooperate, we will establish contact with him,&quot; Tykhyi added.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-has-good-dialogue-with-potential/	2024-11-28T10:55:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166614075.jpg
Russian troops operated torture chamber for Ukrainians in Belarus in 2022, media reports	Russian troops operated a torture chamber in Belarus in the spring of 2022, the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC) reported on Nov. 28. Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians abducted from Ukraine were reportedly held there. The chamber was located on Belarusian government-owned property in the town of Naroulia, not far from the border with Ukraine, according to BIC. The Russian military has reportedly set up a camp in Naroulia for people captured in Kyiv Oblast during the early stages of the full-scale war. In comments to BIC, human rights activists described the Naroulia camp as a place where the treatment of civilian hostages &#x201C;was among the most brutal.&#x201D; Lawyer Yulia Polekhina, working with the Sich human rights group, said that prisoners were tortured there. Polekhina&#x2019;s words echo those of former prisoners who went through Naroulia. &#x201C;They beat up civilians there really hard. One could hear constant screaming there,&#x201D; said Bohdan Lysenko, a soldier with the Ukrainian Armed Forces who was captured by the Russian military and brought to the camp in March 2022, in a comment to BIC. According to the investigation, the camp was located in the compound owned by Pripyatski Alyans on Kamsamolskaya Street. Owned by the Belarusian state, the company conducts catering and food procurement for regional institutions. The company did not comment on the allegations and advised to contact local authorities for more information. The Reckoning Project, the Ukrainian-American organization that records human rights violations, suggests that the actions of the Russian military in Naroulia may indicate a violation of the Geneva Convention provisions, which prohibit forced displacement of civilians and ban keeping military personnel and civilians at the same detention center. The Russian military was reportedly present at the location at least until early May 2022. Russia has terrorized Ukrainians in torture chambers across the occupied territories, with previous reports indicating the use of this tactic in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, as well as the previously occupied areas of Kherson Oblast. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko provided Belarus territory for Russia to launch the all-out war against Ukraine in February 2022. Belarus hosted Russian troops, served as a launchpad for Russian missile attacks against Ukraine, and supplied weapons to the Kremlin. Belarus also took part in the abduction of Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-operated-torture-chamber-for-ukrainians-in-belarus-in-2022-media-reports/	2024-11-28T09:33:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/02/kch-3831-1663946879vzzuo.jpg
Ukraine says US landmines are necessary, Trump's ally disagrees	Tucker Carlson, a controversial U.S. political commentator and talk show host with Donald Trump&apos;s ear, has slammed the decision to provide Ukraine with landmines, warning the weaponry Kyiv claims it needs to defend itself from Russia&apos;s invasion will only &quot;kill innocents.&quot; Carlson is the recent top ally of the U.S. President-elect Trump who had criticized the current administration&apos;s decision to provide Kyiv with additional weapons and permits before the end of its term. &quot;There&apos;s no justification for using anti-personnel mines (APLs) in this conflict, which can&apos;t hope to be solved,&quot; Carlson said in an interview with the Redacted podcast on Nov. 24. Carlson&apos;s comments come nearly three years into Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, a war in which Ukraine relies on support from the U.S. and other Western allies to defend itself. While the use of landmines in conflicts is controversial, the weaponry has been widely used by both sides in the war. The outgoing administration of Joe Biden and Ukrainian officials insist they are necessary to help Kyiv to defend itself. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine&apos;s former foreign minister, told the BBC earlier this month that he understands the &quot;moral ramifications for human rights defenders&quot; regarding APLs posing a risk to civilians. &quot;But we&apos;re fighting a war against a vicious enemy, and we must have the right to use everything we need within the realm of international law to defend ourselves,&quot; Kuleba added. Biden, on Nov. 19 authorized the transfer of APLs for Ukraine in response to Russia&apos;s grinding offensive advancing in the eastern Donetsk Oblast, which has gathered pace in recent weeks. The controversial move comes after another major policy shift, in which the Biden administration allowed the use of U.S.-made ATACMS missiles deep inside Russian territory. Earlier in June 2022, the White House announced the U.S. would no longer produce or transfer the mines, aiming &quot;to curtail the use of APLs worldwide.&quot; But in explaining the change in policy, and the decision to provide them to Ukraine, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CNN that &quot;the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting, they&apos;ve kind of changed their tactics a bit.&quot; Thus, Ukraine needs &quot;things that can help slow down that effort,&quot; Austin added. &quot;Landmines could help minimize Ukrainian casualties by reducing the need for soldiers to enter certain battle zones,&quot; Jean-Christophe Noel, a research fellow on Security and International Relations at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;By placing mines in key areas, you can block enemy movement. It won&apos;t stop Russian troops entirely, but it can slow them down. Moreover, in case of a front-line crisis, mines will delay Russian forces, giving Ukraine time to react.&quot; An APL is a small explosive device made out of plastic or metal that militaries usually use to hinder advancing enemy troops or vehicles, and protect military positions. Combatants often bury them in the ground or conceal them in buildings. APLs come in different types, each serving a specific purpose. Generally, they explode when a person steps on them, touches them, or comes within a certain proximity. The range of damage and functionality varies depending on the type and size of the landmine. According to Gerald C. Cauderay, a former International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegate, blast mines typically affect an area within one to two meters. Snow-covered land mines are seen in a trench at the position of the Ukrainian military near the city of Horlivka, occupied since 2014 in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Dec. 16, 2023. (Oleh Arkhanhorodsky/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)Other types include fragmentation mines, which are designed to injure by throwing shrapnel into the air in a wide radius. U.S. officials are keeping quiet about the specific type of mines that will be sent to Ukraine. &quot;The anti-personnel mines treaty, established decades ago, bans most landmines, allowing only controlled mines like the Claymore, which detonates via controller (remotely) and self-deactivates after a set time,&quot; Mick Ryan, a senior fellow for military studies at the Lowy Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;These may be the type the U.S. is supplying to Ukraine,&quot; he added. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have used landmines heavily during the war. &quot;Ukraine is now the most mined country in the world, with potentially 23% of its land at risk of contamination with landmines and unexploded ordinances,&quot; the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said in a report this month. Although international law does not prohibit the use of APLs, over 160 countries signed the Ottawa Treaty in 1997 &#x2014; the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention &#x2014; which bans the creation, production, storage, and use of landmines. Ukraine is a signatory of this treaty, but neither the U.S. nor Russia has signed it. Human rights activists and international organizations are warning about the risks posed by APLs in Ukraine to civilians now, and in the future.

(Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images)&quot;President Biden&apos;s decision to transfer anti-personnel landmines risks civilian lives and sets back international efforts to eradicate these indiscriminate weapons,&quot; said Mary Wareham, Human Rights Watch (HRW) director. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an independent humanitarian organization, is concerned about the indiscriminate impact of landmines on civilians who are not part of the fighting. &quot;We (the ICRC) can see that the rhetoric regarding the allowance of weapons has changed in the war between Ukraine and Russia because there are an increasing number of Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure, including electricity, heating, and water systems, worsening people&apos;s living conditions,&quot; Patrick Griffiths, a Red Cross spokesperson in Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;However, the ICRC does call to respect the international treaties regarding the use of weapons. It&apos;s important to ensure that any use stays within the international humanitarian law,&quot; Griffiths added. Trump, who is to take over as president in January 2022, has not himself commented on the provision of APLs to Ukraine. But he has pledged to swiftly end the war, hinting that Ukraine could have to make some concessions. Carlson went on to describe President Volodymyr Zelensky as undemocratic and his country&apos;s fight for survival as a nation as not worth supporting. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a matter of defending democracy,&quot; Carlson said.

Holding national elections in Ukraine is not permitted under martial law, a measure that was taken as a result of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion launched in early 2022. Carlson&apos;s comments are likely to deepen concern in Kyiv that Trump could cut U.S. military support for Ukraine in a bid to pressure it into concessions.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-ally-tucker-carlson-slams-biden-for-giving-ukraine-land-mines-says-killing-is-the-point/	2024-11-28T09:04:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1519653702.jpg
Ukraine destroys Russian $5 million radar system in Crimea, military intelligence claims	Ukraine destroyed a Russian high-value radar station, 48Y6-K1 Podlet, near the village of Kotovske in occupied Crimea on Nov. 28, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) reported. While no further details have been disclosed, HUR claimed to be behind the operation. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t verify the claim. Podlet is a modern mobile radar system designed to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes. The system has an estimated price tag of around $5 million. The news comes after multiple explosions were reported across Crimea with Russian proxies claiming to have downed Ukrainian missiles and drones. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian military and industrial targets in Sevastopol and elsewhere in the occupied peninsula during the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-military-intelligence-says-it-destroyed-russian-5-million-radar-system/	2024-11-28T09:03:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/462399914_3893767737532620_3969538192184221239_n.jpg
Putin threatens to target 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv with Oreshnik missile	&quot;Decision-making centers&quot; in Kyiv can be among the targets of Oreshnik, Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Nov. 28. Putin has repeatedly threatened to attack Ukraine&apos;s &quot;decision-making centers&quot; since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale war. Russia daily strikes Ukrainian cities with drones, missiles, and guided bombs, with nearly 200 aerial targets launched at Ukraine overnight on Nov. 28. Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) summit in Astana, Putin said that Russia&apos;s military leadership is now &quot;choosing targets&quot; in Ukraine to hit them with Oreshnik. &quot;These could be military facilities, defense and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centers in Kyiv,&quot; Putin said. Russia first launched Oreshnik in an attack against the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon,&quot; which later was refuted by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia&apos;s Oreshnik attack followed Kyiv&apos;s first successful strike on a military target on Russian soil using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The Russian Defense Ministry admitted more such strikes against targets in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts had followed later. According to Putin, Russia has begun mass production of Oreshnik. Previously, a U.S. official told the Kyiv Independent that Moscow likely possesses &quot;only a handful&quot; of these experimental missiles. &quot;In the case of a mass use of these missiles, the power of this strike would be comparable to the use of nuclear weapons. Although Oreshnik is not a weapon of mass destruction,&quot; Putin added. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. Experts have called into question his claims regarding the weapon&apos;s novelty. Analysts, including Pentagon officials, have said the missile appears to be based heavily on Russia&apos;s RS-26 Rubezh IRBM. The missile fired at Ukraine a week ago carried warheads without explosives, Reuters reported on Nov. 27, citing two unnamed senior Ukrainian government sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-threatens-to-target-decision-making-centers-in-kyiv-with-oreshnik-missile/	2024-11-28T08:11:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186536972.jpg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 155	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 155 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Nov. 18-24, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. State 2025 budget projects Hr 66.01 billion ($1.6 billion) in SOE net profit and dividends. On Nov. 19, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s Parliament, approved Draft Law No. 12000 &#x201C;On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2025.&quot; According to that law, the state budget projects a revenue of Hr 66.01 billion ($1.6 billion) in SOE net profit and dividends. This would make up 2.85% of the expected state budget revenues, which are projected at Hr 2.32 trillion ($55 billion). Ukrenergo gets a new executive board member. On Nov.22, Ukrenergo announced that Vitalii Zaichenko, director for managing the Integrated Power System (IPS of Ukraine) and chief dispatcher of Ukrenergo, joined the company&#x2019;s executive board. Zaichenko will continue performing his responsibilities as the chief dispatcher, the company said. He will also oversee the coordination of parallel operation of the IPS of Ukraine with ENTSO-E. According to Ukrenergo, Vitalii Zaichenko began his career as an engineer specializing in the optimisation of electric modes at Ukrenergo back in 1996. He actively participated in creating the Burshtyn TPP Island and enabling the synchronous operation of the IPS of Ukraine with ENTSO-E, the company added. As we wrote in Issue 146, on Sept. 2, Ukrenergo&#x2019;s supervisory board dismissed the company&#x2019;s CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyi by a majority vote. The board appointed executive board member Oleksii Brekht as an acting CEO and decided to hold a competitive selection for a new CEO. On the same day, Daniel Dobbeni (independent member and supervisory board chair) and Peder Andreasen (independent member) announced that they had filed their resignation notices. On Sept. 10, Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached a staff-level agreement on the fifth review of the four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement. Subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board, Ukraine will have access to about $1.1 billion. According to the IMF&#x2019;s release, the full supervisory board of Ukrenergo should be re-established by end-December 2024. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 20, the Energy Ministry in its capacity as Ukrenergo&#x2019;s general shareholders meeting decided to hold a competitive selection for three independent members of the company&#x2019;s supervisory board. The fourth independent member will be elected in parallel under a previously launched procedure, the Ministry added back then. The selection of all board members &#x2014; four independent and three state representatives &#x2014; is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 9. The first and foremost task of the new supervisory board would be to conduct a transparent competitive selection of Ukrenergo&#x2019;s CEO, the ministry also said. HACC does not extend pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev. On Nov. 20, the Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC) said that the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) had declined to extend pre-trial restrictions for former Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev. According to AntAC, the term of pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev expired on Nov. 12. He was required to report any change of residence, refrain from communicating with witnesses, and surrender his passports for international travel. The Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO) filed a motion with the HACC to extend the term of Kobolyev&#x2019;s duties on Nov. 1. However, the HACC hearings on Nov. 5 and 8, which were supposed to consider this motion, were cancelled. Instead, on Nov. 1, the HACC granted Kobolyev permission to travel abroad from Nov. 4&#x2013;25 , AntAC added. However, no trips abroad occurred, AntAC added, and Kobolyev said that he remained in Kyiv. He added that he has not missed a single court hearing and, despite the end of his restrictions, would not be running away. Kobolyev also said that he would attend the next court hearing, scheduled for Nov. 26, as usual, in person. As we reported in Issue 71, on Jan. 19, 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and SAPO charged Kobolyev with illegally awarding himself Hr 229 million, part of a bonus given to the Naftogaz team for their victory against Russia&#x2019;s Gazprom in Stockholm&#x2019;s court of arbitration in 2018. Hr 229 million was $8.8 million or &#x20AC;7.6 million at the time when bonuses were awarded. On Aug. 9, 2023, HACC decided to extend the Hr 229 million bail ($6.1 million or &#x20AC;5.6 million at that time) for another two months and left Kobolyev&#x2019;s procedural obligations, including pre-trial restrictions, unchanged. See SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 99 for details. On Sept. 25, 2023, HACC removed the electronic ankle monitoring device from Kobolyev and halved his bail to the amount already paid, Hr 107 million ($2.9 million or &#x20AC;2.8 million). See Issue 104 for more detail. As we reported in Issue 113, on Nov. 29, 2023, SAPO said that it filed abuse of office charges against Kobolyev. On Nov. 30, 2023, at the first preparatory hearing on Kobolyev&#x2019;s charges, HACC granted the SAPO prosecutor&#x2019;s motion and extended his procedural duties until Jan. 30, 2024. On Dec. 14, 2023, following the results of the preparatory meeting, the panel of judges at the HACC denied the defense&#x2019;s request to return the indictment, scheduled a hearing on the merits, and commenced a hearing in the Kobolyev case. Since then, the HACC has constantly extended the pre-trial restrictions for Kobolyev. See Case No. 991/10459/23. In June 2024, Oleksiy Nosov, the lead attorney and communicator in the Kobolyev case on the part of the defense, was detained for a suspected attempt to bribe NABU and SAPO in an unrelated case, after which HACC set bail for him. The case involves an alleged theft of Hr 716 million ($17 million) worth of electricity from Ukrenergo by a group led by Mykhailo Kiperman, a businessman reportedly associated with the Privat group. For an extended background on the Kobolyev case, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 71, 72, 73, 77, 78, 79, 83, 84, 88, 91, 99, 104, 113, and 136. For a detailed analysis of this case from a corporate governance perspective, see series of columns by SOE Weekly team members Andriy Boytsun, Oleksandr Lysenko, and Dmytro Yablonovskyi: Are Kobolyev&#x2019;s bonuses a threat to corporate governance reform? Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, and Part 5. Ukrainian banks post cumulative net profits of Hr 117.63 billion ($2.8 billion) in January-September 2024; state-owned banks make 63% of the total, Opendatabot reported. The data provider also noted that despite the tax, which increased from 18% to 25% this year, the total net profit is 7% higher than the Hr 109.85 billion recorded over the same period of 2023. However, it is somewhat lower if the 2023 profits are converted into euros at the 2023 rate, &#x20AC;2.77 billion. As we reported in Issue 113, in 2023, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a law increasing taxes for banks, with some of the key changes concerning the income tax rate. That rate had been 18%, but the law introduced a windfall income tax of 50% for 2023, applied retrospectively. The income tax as from Jan. 1, 2024 was then set at 25%. However, that rate has also been recently increased to 50% retroactively for 2024 as part of the tax increase bill, Draft Law No. 11416-d. The law was adopted by parliament on Oct. 10, but it is yet to be signed by the president to become effective. This means that, once the law is effective, Ukrainian banks will pay Hr 58.82 billion ($1.4 billion) in income taxes for January-September 2024 alone. Five state-owned banks accounted for 63% of Ukrainian banks&#x2019; total profits: As we wrote in Issue 119, the bank reported a net profit of Hr 37.8 billion ($909 million) in 2023. As we reported in Issue 129, PrivatBank paid Hr 50 billion ($1.2 billion) in taxes and dividends. This was as much as 3% of total projected state budget revenues for 2024. As we reported in Issue 128, Oschadbank earned a record Hr 6 billion ($144 million) profit in 2023. In Issue 121, we wrote that Oschadbank paid the state the first half of the 2023 dividends, Hr 0.7 billion ($16.8 million). As we reported earlier, Sense Bank, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and Andrey Kosogov, was nationalized in late July 2023.&#x202F;See more in our Issue 98. As we wrote in Issue 132, Ukrainian banks posted combined profits of Hr 40 billion ($961 million) in Q1 2024, with state-owned banks making 60% of the total. As we reported in Issue 146, in January-July 2024, banks&#x2019; cumulative profits were Hr 120 billion ($2.8 billion). State-owned banks made 63% of the total. Ukrnafta acquires a 51% stake in Shell&#x2019;s Ukrainian petrol station chain, becoming the largest player in the market. On Nov. 19, Naftogaz Group announced that Ukrnafta, one of its subsidiaries, had signed an agreement with Shell to acquire a 51% stake in Alliance Holding LLC. The price of the deal was not disclosed. EP&#x2019;s source at Ukrnafta also refused to name the price, saying that it was &#x201C;very reasonable.&quot; According to EP&#x2019;s and Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s sources, the main part would be covered by credit funds. According to EP, if the deal is successfully completed, Ukrnafta&#x2019;s 547 filling stations would be joined by 118 Shell stations, making Ukrnafta the largest player in the retail fuel market in Ukraine. In the coming days, Ukrnafta and Shell will file their application for merger clearance by the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU), a prerequisite for completing the transaction. Following approval, the company will be able to complete the transaction and assume all shareholder rights and obligations, Naftogaz added. Shell ranks among the top 10 chains in Ukraine in terms of sales, with 118 operating filling stations. It was ranked No. 9 for fuel sales in the first half of 2023 and No. 7 for the number of stations, most of which are located in high-traffic areas, Naftogaz also said. According to Ukrnafta&#x2019;s CEO Sergii Koretsky, the company&#x2019;s supervisory board approved this acquisition because it aligns with Ukrnafta&#x2019;s development strategy. All Shell&#x2019;s filling stations would be rebranded over the course of the year. Existing B2B contracts would be fully fulfilled, and its staff of 1,550 employees retained, Koretsky explained. Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s source at Ukrnafta also did not rule out the possibility of the company attempting to acquire the 49% stake held by State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) to gain full ownership of the chain. As we reported in May 2024 (Issue 130), the SPFU said that it obtained control over 49% of the share capital of Alliance Holding LLC, which operates Shell petrol station chain in Ukraine. Alliance Holding was previously owned by Eduard Khudainatov, a former top manager of the Russian state-owned company Rosneft, who also owns Independent Oil and Gas Company. In June 2022, he was sanctioned by the European Union, and in October 2022, by Ukraine. As we also wrote in Issue 130, on Oct. 4, 2023, the Justice Ministry filed a lawsuit with the HACC to seize Khudainatov&#x2019;s assets, which included Alliance Holding. In January 2024, the HACC refused to seize a stake in Alliance Holding. The reason was that Shell had increased its stake in the Ukrainian subsidiary after the full-scale invasion to 97.4% via two recapitalisations. The share of the company, which the Justice Ministry associates with Khudainatov, was diluted to 2.6%. The Justice Ministry appealed, and on April 2, the Appeals Chamber of the HACC allowed the nationalization of a 49% stake in Alliance Holding LLC. According to Forbes Ukraine, the court agreed with the ministry&#x2019;s argument that Shell had diluted Khudainatov&#x2019;s stake after he was sanctioned. &#x201C;There has been a violation of Ukraine&#x2019;s public order and a dilution of the sanctioned person&#x2019;s share bypassing the sanctions,&#x201D; the media&#x2019;s source said. Shell then said that Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;unjustified appropriation of (the company&#x2019;s) foreign investments and assets is contrary to international law protecting international investors.&#x201D; The company would do everything it could to protect its employees, assets, investments, and reputation, Shell added. As we reported in November 2024 (Issue 154), the SPFU said that it was preparing to privatize its 49% stake in the Shell petrol station chain. Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) said that Shell&apos;s history in Ukraine was complicated. At first, the company was forced to abandon a gas production project in Donetsk oblast, followed by the annexation of Crimea and the loss of some petrol stations. Later, Shell terminated the agreement on gas production in Kharkiv oblast. After that, according to the market participants interviewed by EP, it was only a matter of time before Shell completely exited the Ukrainian market. EP also said the reason was the HACC&#x2019;s decision (discussed above) to seize 49% of Alliance Holding from Khudainatov. According to the media outlet&#x2019;s sources, negotiations on the possible sale of the stake began in the summer of 2024. Forbes Ukraine&#x2019;s source confirmed this, noting that Shell did not want to be in partnership with an unpredictable company that would win the SPFU auction. This is not the first time since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion that Ukrnafta has gained control over other petrol station chains. As we reported earlier, Ukrnafta manages the seized assets of the Glusco group. On March 14, the AMCU allowed Ukrnafta to take over the management of Glusco&#x2019;s assets &#x2014; see Issue 123. On March 15, Ukrnafta and ARMA said that they signed acts of acceptance for the transfer of Glusco assets. &#x2013; see Issue 124. As we wrote in Issue 137 (June 2024), Ukrnafta also got permission to manage the seized Tatneft Group&#x2019;s assets. According to Ukrnafta, the assets in Poltava and Kharkiv oblasts include petrol stations, oil depots, and other commercial properties &#x2014; a total of 110 units. See Issues 99, 100, 131, and 137 for more detail. EBRD lends 50 million euros to help Kyiv prepare for winter, the bank&#x2019;s press office announced on Nov. 19. This loan will help to ensure the provision of vital municipal services in Kyiv and mitigate the effects of the ongoing war, the EBRD explained. A first-loss risk cover guarantee from the EU will cover 25% of the loan. This guarantee is vital to the transaction, helping the city and its key municipal utility to immediately address critical liquidity needs and ensure uninterrupted provision of essential public services, the bank also said. The EBRD loan will be co-financed by a 5-million-euro grant from the U.S. &#x201C;The loan will provide liquidity to the city&#x2019;s municipal district heating utility, Kyivteploenergo, ensuring that it remains operational and can retain its existing workforce, continuing to provide vital heating and electricity to the city&#x2019;s residents (including internally displaced Ukrainians who have moved to Kyiv), businesses and other municipal companies,&#x201D; the EBRD added. According to the EBRD, Kyivteploenergo also generates a significant amount of electricity for Kyiv and the country as a whole. These emergency funds are expected to support repairs to the city&#x2019;s damaged infrastructure in preparation for the impending winter heating season. Italy confirms its commitment to provide a 200-million-euro loan for Ukrhydroenergo alongside the EBRD, the company&#x2019;s press office announced on Nov. 21. According to the agreement, signed in February 2024, the loan will be used to purchase critical equipment for the Dnipro and Seredniodniprovska hydroelectric power plants (HPPs), as well as to provide emergency liquidity support to Ukrhydroenergo to ensure the company&#x2019;s sustainability. As we wrote in June 2024 (Issue 135), Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso signed a memorandum of understanding on an energy security emergency response program. Under the agreement, the EBRD will mobilize additional funding of more than 300 million euros to boost Ukraine&#x2019;s energy security. The funds are designated for Ukrenergo, Ukrhydroenergo, and Ukrnafta. See Issue 135 for more detail. The 2025 state budget projects Hr 3.2 billion ($76 million) of privatization proceeds. According to the Draft Law No. 12000, approved by the Verkhovna Rada on Nov. 19, the state budget projects Hr 3.2 billion ($76 million) in privatization proceeds for 2025. That is as little as 0.13% of the expected state budget revenues in 2025, which are planned at Hr 2.32 trillion ($55 billion). This includes projected revenues from both large and small-scale privatization. In the past years, both planned and actual revenues from privatisation have been historically low. As we wrote in Issue 114, the 2023 annual revenue from privatization to the state budget was projected to be Hr 6 billion, or around $144 million. However, the SPFU failed to fulfil this plan (se Issue 114 for more detail). Note that in 2023, only small-scale privatization auctions were held, and no large-scale privatisation deals were made. As we wrote earlier, the state budget envisages Hr 4 billion ($96 million) of privatization proceeds for 2024. As we discuss below, the SPFU has already achieved that target. The winning bidder pays for UMCC. On Nov. 18, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) announced that Cemin Ukraine LLC, the winner of the privatization auction, had fully paid Hr 3.94 billion ($95 million) for United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC). According to the privatisation terms, the winner must maintain UMCC&#x2019;s core business and invest at least Hr 400 million ($9.6 million) in technical re-equipment and modernization. In addition, it must pay off overdue accounts payable (Hr 609 million or $14.6 million as of the end of March 2024) and wage and budget arrears, if any, at the time of transfer of ownership, the SPFU explained earlier. As we wrote in Issue 151, the SPFU sold UMCC on Oct. 9. According to the SPFU and Prozorro.Sale, the only bidder, and, accordingly, the winner, is Cemin Ukraine LLC, owned by Azerbaijani businessman Nasib Hasanov. Hasanov is the owner of the Azerbaijani NEQSOL Holding, which is known in Ukraine for being the owner of the telecom company Vodafone Ukraine. In Azerbaijan, NEQSOL also owns the telecom operator Bakcell. Besides, NEQSOL has extensive experience in the mining business. See more on Hasanov in Issue 151. UMCC is Ukraine&#x2019;s largest titanium ore concentrate mining and processing company. It comprises the Vilnohirsk Mining and Metallurgical Plant in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and the Irshansk Plant in Zhytomyr oblast. This was not the first attempt to sell the company. As we wrote in Issue 33 three years ago, the UMCC privatization auction was scheduled to take place on Aug. 31, 2021. Later, in SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issue 41, we reported that the SPFU cancelled that auction because it only had one qualified bidder. The media published a list of participants allegedly interested in UMCC assets. Some of them said that the asset was not well prepared for privatisation, and they did not consider the auction terms fair. Others claimed that the starting price was unreasonable. It was reportedly impossible to estimate the company&#x2019;s mineral deposits. The SPFU&#x2019;s auction commission set Oct. 29, 2021 as the new auction date, but that auction was also cancelled (see Issue 49 for more). So was the following auction on Dec. 20, 2021 (see Issue 57 for more detail). See more on the previous attempts to sell UMCC in our Issues 33, 41, 49, 56, and 57. As we reported in Issue 106, the SPFU planned for UMCC to be one of the first large companies to be privatized. However, as we wrote in Issue 109, then acting head of the SPFU Oleksandr Fedoryshyn said later in October 2023 that the SPFU was going to offer investors to buy UMCC in a single package with Demurinsky Mining and Processing Plant. Vitaliy Koval, the newly appointed head of the SPFU, confirmed this later in an interview in January (see our Issue 117). In effect, this suggested that the SPFU&#x2019;s previously announced plans to privatize UMCC as one of the first targets would be seriously delayed, if not put aside. However, the SPFU&#x2019;s communication on the matter in May suggested that the Fund discarded the idea of bundling UMCC and Demurinsky in a single lot. The SPFU auction commission determined the terms of UMCC&#x2019;s privatization on May 23, setting the starting price at Hr 3.9 billion (around $90 million at that time). See Issue 133 for more detail. As we wrote in Issue 150, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) completed the pre-trial investigation into the Dmytro Sennychenko case, alleging the SPFU&#x2019;s former head and his accomplices of embezzling millions from state-owned enterprises, including Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and UMCC in 2019-2021. See our Issues 80, 83, 105, 106, 109, 117, 114, 131, and 150 for detail. The sale of UMCC increased privatization proceeds to Hr 9.26 billion ($222 million), the SPFU reported on Nov. 18. Thus, SPFU said, it exceeded its annual privatization revenue target for 2024 by more than 2.3 times. Besides, the buyers&#x2019; obligations to pay accounts payable of the SOEs they purchased in the amount of Hr 1.597 billion ($38 million) would also be fulfilled. As we wrote in Issue 114, the 2024 state budget projected the privatization revenue at Hr 4 billion (around $96 million). According to a recent SPFU report, privatization generated Hr 2 billion ($48 million) in January-August 2024. All these proceeds were from small-scale privatization. As we reported in Issue 154, the sale of the Hotel Ukraina, the first large-scale privatization lot, increased privatization proceeds to Hr 5.7 billion ($137 million). In other words, as we wrote, the privatization of Hotel Ukraina alone has generated more revenue than all small-scale privatizations since the beginning of this year. After the buyer paid up as required by the regulations, the SPFU&#x2019;s privatization revenue plan for 2024, however modest, was achieved for the first time in many years. The sale of UMCC was the second successful auction in the framework of large-scale privatization. The SPFU plans to hold another large-scale privatization auction by the end of 2024. The auction for the sale of AEROC, seized from sanctioned Russian oligarch Molchanov, is scheduled for Dec. 19. The starting price is Hr 965 million ($23 million). See Issue 152 for more detail.

Netherlands hands over 3 Patriot air defense launchers to Ukraine	The Netherlands delivered three new Patriot air defense launchers to Ukraine, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans announced on Nov. 28. &quot;This saves lives and protects vital infrastructure. It is and remains in our common interest to stop Russian aggression,&quot; Brekelmans said on social media. Kyiv has been calling on its partners to provide additional air defense assets as Russia intensifies its strikes against cities ahead of winter. Russia launched nearly 100 drones and 90 missiles against Ukraine overnight on Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure. Additional emergency blackouts were introduced across the country following the attack. &quot;I am grateful to Minister Brekelmans and the Dutch government for strengthening Ukrainian air defense capabilities,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said. Ukraine has received at least three Patriot systems from Germany and one from the U.S. Other countries, like the Netherlands and Spain, delivered individual launchers or missiles. The U.S. and the Netherlands also pledged in June to deliver one additional system each. Romania transferred a Patriot to Ukraine too after the donation was finally approved in early September. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 27 that key commitments from NATO&apos;s July summit in Washington, including air defense systems and other military support, have not yet been fully implemented.	https://kyivindependent.com/netherlands-hands-over-3-patriot-launchers-to-ukraine/	2024-11-28T07:05:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GddXARzXQAAsH96.jpg
Ukraine withdraws over 20,000 mortar shells due to malfunction	Out of 54,000 120 mm mortar shells suspected of having defects, about 24,000 are to be withdrawn, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said on Nov. 28. He said that it would constitute less than 1% of the defense production in 2024. The mines were domestically produced, according to the people familiar with the matter. Smetanin&apos;s statement follows Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry&apos;s announcement on Nov. 26 that it had been investigating the causes of the abnormal malfunction of the 120 mm mortar shells. As the defects were discovered, the ammunition was suspended in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the shells were seized for investigation. One of the manufacturing plants received a complaint about 120 mm shells from the Logistics Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Nov. 20, according to Smetanin. The workgroup worked from Nov. 11 to 15 and concluded that several product components operated abnormally. As a result, some of the ammunitions were of poor quality. Smetanin added that in light of recent reports of mine malfunctions, the latest batches of manufactured arms were being re-tested. &quot;At the same time, all Ukrainian defense companies continue to operate as usual: to manufacture and supply high-quality weapons and military equipment to the Defense Forces,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation around low-quality mines has also become an additional incentive for all manufacturers to be more careful about the quality control of their products at all stages of production.&quot; Earlier, Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of the parliament&apos;s Committee on National Security, Defense, and Intelligence, told Suspilne that the Interagency Commission to investigate the malfunctioning of 120 mm mortar shells named lower temperatures and high humidity as the main causes of the defects. Artillery and mortar shells are crucial on the front as Ukraine already struggles to match up with the better-stocked Russian forces. According to ZN news outlet, the supply of the shells in question was a result of a deal between the Defense Ministry and the Strategic Industries Ministry to purchase ammunition from a domestic producer and thus decrease dependence on foreign supplies. The outlet did not name the factory commissioned to manufacture the shells but said it was part of the state-owned defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom and was often targeted by Russian attacks. The media investigation highlighted the Defense Ministry&apos;s supposedly inadequate quality control process. Warnings raised by some officials regarding the plant&apos;s ability to produce detonators for the shells &quot;disappeared&quot; during the process, and military officials failed to report initial problems with the shells that surfaced in September. In its statement, the Defense Ministry stressed that the Strategic Industries Ministry was responsible for carrying out the order. Preliminary conclusions named low-quality charges and poor storage conditions as possible causes. Ukraine&apos;s defense sector has been plagued by several major procurement scandals throughout the full-scale war. The two most notorious scandals, one regarding inflated prices for food supplies and the other connected to low-quality winter jackets, prompted the dismissal of former Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-withdraws-over-20-000-mortar-shells-due-to-malfunction/	2024-11-28T06:04:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2166820433.jpg
Drones reportedly attack Krasnodar Krai, woman suffers injuries	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) reportedly attacked two settlements in Russia&apos;s Krasnodar Krai on Nov. 28, injuring a woman, Governor Veniamin Kondratiev claimed on his Telegram channel. In the town of Slavyansk-on-Kuban, drone debris fell into the courtyard of a house, breaking its windows. The owner of the house was injured and received medical treatment at the scene of impact. The drone debris damaged a house in a village in Krasnoarmeysk district. There were no casualties. Later in the day, Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that the Russian air force allegedly downed 25 Ukrainian drones, 14 of which were intercepted over Krasnodar Krai. Another six drones were shot down over Bryansk Oblast, three over Russian-occupied Crimea, and two over Rostov Oblast. Ukrainian authorities did not comment on the recent attacks in Russia. The Kyiv Independent couldn&apos;t verify the claim. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted.	https://kyivindependent.com/drones-reportedly-attack-krasnodar-krai-woman-suffers-injuries/	2024-11-28T05:39:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1604726426.jpg
Russia 'unlikely' to launch nuclear attack despite Putin's threats, US intelligence says	Washington&apos;s decision to allow Kyiv to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia has not increased the risk of a nuclear attack, Reuters reported on Nov. 27, citing five unnamed sources familiar with the intelligence data. The news comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin updated the nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19, and Russian government officials continue to criticize the recent White House decision, calling it a push for &quot;escalation.&quot; Despite the Kremlin&apos;s recent statements, the risk of a nuclear attack is unlikely, Reuters reported, citing its unidentified sources. Intelligence assessments over the past seven months have shown that a nuclear escalation is unlikely to result from a decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. weapons. &quot;The assessments were consistent: The ATACMS weren&apos;t going to change Russia&#x2019;s nuclear calculus,&quot; said one congressional aide briefed on the intelligence Meanwhile, Moscow is expected to expand its campaign of sabotage against European facilities to increase pressure on the West for its support of Kyiv, two high-ranking officials, a lawmaker, and two congressional aides told the news agency. One of the five U.S. officials also noted that unveiling the new missile, referring to the Russian-made Oreshnik, is a step toward escalation. U.S. officials said the intelligence helped guide the contentious debate within the Joe Biden administration over whether Washington should ease restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S. weapons because of the risk of provoking Putin. In mid-November, Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, a decision to strengthen Ukraine&apos;s negotiating position. His administration previously resisted supplying such weapons over concerns of escalating tensions with Russia. The changes come amid significant challenges for Ukraine, including battlefield losses, reports of North Korea sending troops to support Russia, and Donald Trump taking office in January. Trump has vowed to end the war within 24 hours, but officials worry his administration would cut off aid to Ukraine, undermining its ability to resist Russian aggression. Many U.S. officials now acknowledge that Ukraine could be pushed into talks within months and might be forced to cede territory to end the war, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Nov. 26.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-unlikely-to-launch-nuclear-attack-despite-putins-threats-us-intelligence-says/	2024-11-28T04:30:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Monthly inflation in Russia accelerates, hitting a record number in 2.5 years	Russian monthly inflation in November hit a record high, rising over 1.5 times compared to October, the Moscow Times reported on Nov. 27. According to the Federal State Statistics Service (RosStat), during the week of Nov. 19-25, the consumer price index increased by 0.36%, up 1.15% from the beginning of the month, and over 8% from the beginning of the year. The Russian economy is facing a challenge in light of poor harvest, as well as Western sanctions that have been tightening over the past three years due to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Further constraints are caused by the substantial costs of supporting the war in Ukraine, including an increased military budget and domestic military production. Inflation&apos;s biggest impact was on groceries, where prices have risen by a double-digit percentage and continue to rise, according to the RosStat. Since the beginning of the year, the price for potatoes increased by 78.4%, cabbage &#x2014; by 30.7%, and beetroot &#x2014; by 27%. Butter costs 31.6% more, despite the government&apos;s attempts to increase imports from Turkey and Iran. Overall food inflation exceeded 10% for the first time since January 2023, the Moscow Times reported. Meanwhile, the currency value has continued to drop compared to the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Chinese yuan. The ruble exchange rate fell to 15.16 per yuan, 114.50 rubles per dollar and 120.83 rubles per euro, according to the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Russian Central Bank has decided not to conduct foreign currency purchases from Nov. 28 until the end of 2024. Russia&apos;s ruble suffered a blow following the news that the U.S. had imposed sanctions on 50 Russian banks, including Gazprombank. Until now, the U.S. had avoided targeting Gazprombank to enable European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank serves as the main channel for energy-related payments, the Financial Times reported. With this channel closed, international payments for Russian oil and gas will be harder, drying up a part of the Kremlin&#x2019;s foreign currency revenue. The ruble is expected to weaken further with the beginning of the winter holiday season, as companies have to import more goods from abroad to satisfy increased consumer demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/inflation-in-russia-sets-record-since-april-2022-amid-significant-acceleration/	2024-11-28T04:08:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1252236776.jpg
Ukraine Business Roundup — Israel wants Ukraine’s help countering drones	The following is the Nov. 26, 2024 edition of our Ukraine Business Roundup weekly newsletter. To get the biggest news in business and tech from Ukraine directly in your inbox, subscribe here. Our most-read article last week was a story about how after Israel repeatedly ignored Ukraine&#x2019;s warnings and offers to help counter the threat of Iranian drones, the tides appear to be turning as Israel faces increased drone attacks. The independent Israeli investigative outlet Shomrim found that after talking with dozens of officials and key individuals in the defense technology sector, early signs of collaboration are emerging as Israeli defense tech companies seek proven, combat-tested solutions. Earlier this year, Shomrim reported that long before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Ukrainian officials had reached out to their Israeli counterparts to share their experience countering Iranian-made drones that Russia began using against Ukraine in 2022. Their warnings were virtually ignored, Shomrim found. A former senior Ukrainian official said at least one Ukrainian company developing anti-drone technology sent representatives to Israel before the outbreak of the war in Gaza &#x2014; but could not find a single counterpart from the defense sector in Israel willing to meet with them at their office. &#x201C;Someone did agree to meet with them at a fast-food restaurant and I believe that was the only meeting. It was a humiliating experience,&#x201D; said the former official, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations. Both current and former Israeli and Ukrainian officials said that Israel paid a heavy price for dismissing those warnings. The Iranian-made drones that are being launched at Israel from Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Iran itself have led to casualties, destruction, fires, and panic and are now the main challenge currently facing Israel&#x2019;s aerial defense systems. The extent of the threat was underscored by the drone that hit and damaged the private residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea. The Ukrainian companies, for their part, are hoping to grow and profit from the Israeli companies&#x2019; international contacts. Ukraine gained experience from almost three years of war, with over 7,000 drones launched from Russia into Ukraine since the beginning of 2024, including about 2,000 in October alone.

(Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)Russia has damaged 321 port infrastructure facilities, as well as 20 foreign merchant vessels since July 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 23 at the International Conference on Food Security in Kyiv. Zelensky said that the country&apos;s &quot;food exports provide food for 400 million people in 100 countries around the world.&quot; &quot;Food prices in Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, and other countries in Africa directly depend on whether farmers and agricultural companies in Ukraine can operate normally,&quot; Zelensky added.

(Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty Images)Critical financingDTEK, Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, is set to receive $112 million from the EU and the U.S. to restore facilities damaged in Russian attacks and help it get through winter. Why this matters: DTEK, as a private energy company owned by Ukraine&#x2019;s richest man Rinat Akhmetov, has largely been shut out from international financing to make repairs on its critical infrastructure damaged by Russia throughout the war over to its ownership. The newly announced financing is the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion that DTEK is receiving direct financing to help it restore capacity, the company said. Russian attacks destroyed 90% of DTEK&apos;s generation capacity during an aerial campaign in the spring and summer earlier this year. The company put a plan to repair 65% of what was damaged in those months by this winter, but has declined to say publicly how much it was able to repair. DTEK spent around $100 million of its own money last year, and around $65 million this year to repair damages caused by Russian missiles and drones. Reuters reported on Nov. 21 that Russia&#x2019;s missile strikes on Nov. 16-17 hit three of the five operational thermal power plants owned by DTEK, leaving one plant offline. Meanwhile, a controversy over financing DTEK spilled out into public view after Italian media reported that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest institutional investor, will continue to refuse giving any money to the company over the fact that it&#x2019;s owned by an oligarch. In an interview with Italy&apos;s Corrierte della Sera, the bank&#x2019;s president said, without mentioning Akhmetov by name, that the EBRD has &#x201C;very firm ideas&#x201D; on Ukraine freeing itself from the influence of oligarchs, and that &#x201C;accepting compromises on this point would damage the country&#x2019;s prospects in the long term.&#x201D; In a statement, DTEK said it was disappointed by the president&#x2019;s words, writing, &#x201C;The company hopes that the EBRD will further contribute to the restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector.&#x201D; &#x201C;DTEK is ready to work with the bank to secure peace and light in Ukraine,&#x201D; the statement read.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Russian assets &#x2014; What will Trump do with them?As Donald Trump prepares to take office this January, one open question remains over how he&#x2019;ll approach the divisive matter of Russian Central Bank assets frozen across the West. So far, Trump has not directly commented on the frozen Russian assets and his unpredictability makes it hard to know which route he will take. Mobilizing the assets and making Russia pay fits in with his strong-man approach but he may also err on the side of caution for fear of foreign countries, like China and Saudi Arabia, pulling out their assets from the U.S., business reporter Dominic Culverwell writes in his latest. He could pressure a reluctant Brussels to pick up the slack and resolve the EU&#x2019;s bickering over the issue. At least for now, it seems unlikely that Trump would unfreeze the assets and hand them back to Russia. &#x201C;There&apos;s no automatic procedure for Trump to get rid of this whole thing entirely,&#x201D; Anna Vlasyuk, a legal research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) told the Kyiv Independent.

(Kollen Post / The Kyiv Independent)Turning drones from low-cost to boutiqueAfter spending around a year piloting mostly reconnaissance drones, Buntar Aerospace founder Ivan Kaunov recognized the need for a more perfect guidance system for drones being used on the battlefield in Ukraine. He assembled a wishlist of the best gear to put into a Ukrainian drone that would be meant for long-term, deep surveillance usage. Kaunov rallied enough interest to translate into funding for a prototype of the Buntar-1, the basis for his current company, Buntar Aerospace. Over the past year, Buntar has armed itself with nearly $3 million in investment from Ukraine, the EU, and the U.S. Kaunov hopes to build what will be the Cadillac of Ukrainian surveillance drones &#x2013; high-cost, premium quality, and repeat usage &#x2014; in a major divergence from the cheap one-time use drones that have become symbols of Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russia&#x2019;s invasion. Read the full profile here. Ukraine and the World Bank signed a loan agreement worth $4.8 billion, which Kyiv will use for priority budget expenditures, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and the World Bank&apos;s Eastern Europe Operations Manager Kevin Tomlinson signed the agreement for the loan on Nov. 22, which falls under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance (PEACE) project. Since the start of the invasion, Ukraine has received around $35.5 billion through the PEACE project. The U.K. has sanctioned the exiled Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, along with Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, and Latvian politician Aivars Lembergs, the U.K. government announced on Nov. 21. The statement noted that freezing their assets is part of a crackdown on global corruption and &quot;dirty money.&quot; Firtash allegedly &quot;extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from Ukraine&quot; and invested significant amounts of the gains in U.K. properties. His wife, Lada Firtash, was also sanctioned as she &#x201C;profited from his corruption and holds U.K. assets on his behalf.&#x201D; Ukraine is &quot;95%&quot; ready to resume commercial flights, but the key remaining factor is to ensure the safety of passengers, Communities and Territories Development Minister Oleksii Kuleba said on Nov. 21. Speaking with the Suspilne broadcaster, the minister said: &quot;The security architecture requires very serious air defenses... so when we have enough air defense for this or that airport, we will be able to talk about it. Unfortunately, today it is impractical.&quot; Ukrnafta, a state-owned oil and gas extraction company that is a subsidiary of Naftogaz, has bought a 51% stake in Shell&apos;s gas station network in Ukraine, the press service of Naftogaz reported on Nov. 19. Ukrnafta will now hold a majority stake in a network of 118 operational gas stations. Shell, one of Ukraine&#x2019;s top 10 fuel networks, ranks number 9 in fuel sales and number 7 in station numbers, with most stations located in high-traffic areas. All 1,550 employees will keep their jobs, and rebranding is set to be completed within a year. More than two years after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion delayed its release and upended its developers&#x2019; lives, Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&quot; &#x2014; one of the most anticipated video games of the year &#x2014; was released on Nov. 20. Originally set for a release in April 2022, the game experienced several delays when many of its staff were forced to flee Ukraine that February. Ahead of the release this week, presales of the game took it to the top spot for games sold on the popular video game platform Steam.

Russian attacks across Ukraine kill at least 5, injure 25 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed at least five civilians and injured at least 25 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 28. Russia launched a mass combined attack against Ukraine during the night of Nov. 27-28. In the attack, Russian forces used three S-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles, 57 Kh-101 cruise missiles from Tu-95MS strategic bombers, 28 Kalibr cruise missiles, three Kh-59/69 guided missiles, and 97 drones, according to a report by the Ukrainian Air Force. Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile troops, aviation, electronic warfare units, and mobile firing groups shot down 76 Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles, three Kh-59/69 guided missiles, and 35 drones. Meanwhile, 35 drones were lost on the radars due to electronic warfare operations. During the mass attack, Russian forces targeted several oblasts, including the capital of Kyiv. Critical infrastructure facilities were hit, prompting emergency power outages across the country. A 16-year-old boy and a 90-year-old woman were wounded in an attack in Odesa Oblast. They were treated at the scene of the attack. Falling missile debris damaged six houses, according to Governor Oleh Kiper. A woman in Vinnytsia Oblast was injured in the morning combined attack, said Natalia Zabolotna, deputy head of the regional military administration. The Russian strike against the region damaged residential buildings and destroyed an outbuilding. Apart from the combined mass overnight attack, Russian forces also targeted 10 settlements in Kherson Oblast, including the regional center of Kherson. The Russian attacks resulted in the killing of one person and injuries to 14 others, local military administration reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, a Russian FPV (first-person-view) drone hit a tractor in the village of Bilyi Kolodiaz, killing two men and injuring three others, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Donetsk Oblast, one person suffered injuries in the city of Pokrovsk, while in the town of Kostiantynivka, two people were killed due to the Russian strikes, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a woman and two men were injured in the attacks against the Vasyliv district, local military administration said. In Sumy Oblast&apos;s Khotyn community, a drone attack injured a civilian, according to local authorities.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-5-injure-25-over-past-day/	2024-11-28T02:25:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-28-12_02_41.jpeg

Russia launches mass missile attack against Ukraine's power grid	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack against Ukraine the morning of Nov. 28, targeting energy infrastructure. The Air Force announced a nationwide aerial alert after warning that Russia had launched seven Tu-95 strategic bombers. Explosions were reported in mulitple cities, including Kharkiv, Odesa, Lutsk, and Rivne. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia struck a &quot;massive blow&quot; at the nation&apos;s power grid, with attacks on energy infrastructure occurring throughout the country. Ukrenergo, the state grid operator, announced emergency blackouts in multiple regions in an effort to safeguard the energy system from Russia&apos;s assault. Russia has already begun redoubling attacks on Ukraine&apos;s power grid as the country enters its third winter at war. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 24 that Russia had launched more than 800 KAB-guided aerial bombs, nearly 460 attack drones, and more than 20 missiles over the past week. Along with intensifying aerial strikes, Ukraine has recently faced another threat from Russia: a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) dubbed &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; which Russia launched in a Nov. 21 attack against Dnipro. The attack triggered an emergency meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council on Nov. 26 and renewed calls for advanced air defense systems from Western partners.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-mass-missile-attack-against-ukraines-power-grid/	2024-11-27T20:57:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185066674.jpg
Europe in 'actual war' with Russia, former UK intelligence chief says	Europe is not currently in &quot;a pre-war&quot; situation, but in &quot;an actual war&quot; against Russia, former MI6 head Richard Dearlove told Sky News on Nov. 27. &quot;I think we have to face up to the fact that the Russians think they&apos;re in a state of war with us,&quot; Dearlove said. Dearlove&apos;s comments came days after Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned that Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine risked escalating into a &quot;global conflict.&quot; According to Dearlove, the conflict has already spiraled beyond Ukraine&apos;s borders. &quot;Donald Tusk has referred to it as a pre-war situation,&quot; Dearlove said. &quot;I think he&apos;s wrong. I think it&apos;s an actual war.&quot; Dearlove said Russia was waging a hybrid war against Europe across multiple sectors, involving acts of sabotage and &quot;some very aggressive moves.&quot; Directors of intelligence services in Europe, the U.S., and the U.K. have characterized Russia as &quot;going feral,&quot; he said. Russian special services have been linked to sabotage efforts across Europe, including cyberattacks, espionage, and election interference. Since joining NATO in 2023, Finland has complained of intensifying hybrid attacks from bordering Russia. As Russian aggression mounts, the Western coalition may be facing a split, as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s upcoming inauguration heralds a shift in Washington&apos;s support for Europe, NATO, and Ukraine. Western nations are now in &quot;a very dangerous situation,&quot; Dearlove said. While Dearlove said it would be preferable for the West to engage in talks with the Kremlin, he warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not likely to cooperate. &quot;I think we&apos;re in a very difficult situation, and Russia is probably better to have some sort of dialogue with them, than no contact at all. So I don&apos;t rule that out,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think at the moment, I&apos;m not sure Russia is in a mood or a situation where it&apos;s going to be very easy to talk to Putin.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/europe-in-actual-war-with-russia-former-uk-intelligence-chief-says/	2024-11-27T18:52:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1251392843.jpg
White House preparing $725 million military aid package for Ukraine, Reuters reports	U.S. President Joe Biden is preparing a new weapons package for Ukraine worth $725 million, Reuters reported on Nov. 27, citing two unnamed U.S. officials. The Biden administration has pledged to ship as much aid to Ukraine as possible in the coming weeks, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. The new aid package would include landmines, drones, Stinger missiles, and ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), an official familiar with the plan told Reuters. The package will also likely contain cluster munitions, according to a notification seen by Reuters. Congress is expected to receive the formal notification as early as Dec. 2. The exact contents of the aid shipment may change in the coming days before Biden signs off on the delivery. Biden will exercise the Presidential Drawdawn Authority (PDA) to pull the weapons from U.S. stocks. The $725 million marks an increase from recent PDA packages, which are typically well under $5 million. Congress has already allocated between $4-5 billion in remaining PDA funds for Ukraine. Biden has promised to deliver the full amount to Kyiv before Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20 despite logistical hurdles. The Wall Street Journal on Nov. 27 reported that Biden is unlikely to deliver the full amount before the end of his term. As the White House works to speed up weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Biden has also asked Congress to greenlight additional aid funding, Politico reported on Nov. 26. Documents obtained by the outlet show that the administration is requesting $24 billion in military assistance. &#xA0; The rush to fund Ukraine is a direct response to Trump&apos;s avowed skepticism of ongoing U.S. military support for Ukraine. Trump has constistenly said he would seek to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war and bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. While the details of his plan remain unclear, some reports indicate it might entail Ukraine ceding territory and at least temporarily foregoing its NATO aspirations.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-preparing-725-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-reuters-reports/	2024-11-27T17:34:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182722503.jpg
Biden unlikely to deliver full planned multibillion-dollar aid to Ukraine before term ends, WSJ reports	The Biden administration may not be able to deliver the promised multibillion-dollar aid to Ukraine before Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration, The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 27. The administration still has $6.5 billion to transfer to Ukraine, but time is running out to use the allocated resources. The Pentagon has reached its monthly limit on weapons shipments and is facing logistical challenges in delivering arms to Ukraine. To exhaust the remaining funds, the U.S. would need to supply Ukraine with approximately $110 million in weaponry daily, amounting to nearly $3 billion in December and January. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s impossible,&#x201D; a congressional source told the WSJ. A Pentagon source stated that the current plan now is to send $500-750 million worth of weapons from U.S. stockpiles to Ukraine each month. These shipments will mainly consist of artillery and ammunition, as they are easier to transport, while larger equipment could take months to arrive. The remaining decisions on aid will likely fall to the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump&#x2019;s support for Ukraine hangs in the air as analysts and politicians try to gauge his plans to bring peace to Ukraine, as he promised to end the war within &quot;24 hours&quot; after reelection without revealing details. There are concerns that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its military support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russia&#x2019;s war.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-unlikely-to-deliver-full-planned-multibillion-dollar-aid-to-ukraine-before-term-ends-wsj-reports/	2024-11-27T16:16:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147987555.jpg
US urges Ukraine to lower draft age to 18 amid troop shortage, AP reports	The Biden administration is urging Ukraine to lower its draft age from 25 to 18 in an effort to increase troop numbers, the Associated Press reported on Nov. 27, citing an unnamed senior Biden administration official. The recommendation is part of a broader push to address Ukraine&apos;s armed forces personnel shortage as the war with Russia nears its third year. &#x201C;The pure math of Ukraine&#x2019;s situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight,&#x201D; the official said to AP, adding that Ukraine is not currently mobilizing enough soldiers to replace battlefield losses or match Russia&#x2019;s growing military. The proposal has faced resistance from Kyiv, with Ukrainian officials expressing concerns about the lack of equipment for additional troops and potential economic harm from drafting younger workers. European officials, speaking anonymously, have suggested that Western allies believe Ukraine&apos;s primary issue is a shortage of troops rather than weapons, raising concerns about its ability to sustain operations in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk border region. The situation has been further complicated by the arrival of thousands of North Korean troops supporting Moscow&apos;s efforts to reclaim territory lost to a Ukrainian incursion earlier this year. In April, Ukraine passed laws lowering the draft age from 27 to 25, which added 50,000 troops but fell short of the country&apos;s needs. After the new law on mobilization came into force in Ukraine on May 18, military-aged men were given 60 days to update their personal data so that the state could locate them. The deadline for updating data expired on July 17, 2024. From May 18 to July 16, 4,690,496 military-aged men updated their data by the July 17 deadline, according to the Defense Ministry.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-pushes-ukraine-to-lower-draft-age-to-18-amid-troop-shortage-ap-reports/	2024-11-27T14:04:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/army-1.jpg
Kyiv Independent launches winter merch collection celebrating Ukrainian traditions	Following on from the launch of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s online store this summer, we are unveiling our first-ever winter collection in time for the holiday season. This collection is more than just a celebration of the festive season. It&apos;s a testament to the resilience of Ukrainian culture, a heritage that has faced &#x2014; and continues to face &#x2014; the threat of erasure. For generations, Ukrainians have kept the spirit of their unique Christmas traditions alive, even when those traditions were suppressed under Soviet rule. Now, as Ukraine continues to defend its identity and freedom, these customs hold even deeper meaning. We&apos;ve taken those cherished customs &#x2014; the enchanting &#x201C;Carol of the Bells,&#x201D; the symbolic didukh wheat sheaf, and the vibrant vertep puppet theater &#x2014; and reimagined them in a series of unique designs. Each piece tells a story of resilience, artistry, and the enduring spirit of Ukraine. The main inspiration for the collection was the tradition of vertep: a cherished Ukrainian puppet theater tradition that has been an integral part of Christmas celebrations since the 16th century but was nearly extinguished in Soviet times. Here&apos;s a closer look at some of our favorite pieces: Sokil: This design features a stylized goat&apos;s head (a beloved vertep character) flanked by graceful birds that evoke the angels of the nativity. Woven throughout are floral motifs and celestial stars, symbolizing new life and faith. Didukh: This striking design pays homage to didukh, a handcrafted sheaf of wheat brought into homes during the Christmas season to represent the enduring spirit of ancestors and a deep connection to the land. Carol of the Bells: This embroidered design rings in the holiday spirit with a touch of Ukrainian heritage. This quintessential Christmas melody, originally a Ukrainian New Year&apos;s song titled &quot;Shchedryk,&quot; has a history that speaks to the perseverance of Ukrainian culture. Through the eyes of talented Ukrainian artists Albina Kolesnichenko and Polina Olkhovnikova, these traditions are reimagined with a contemporary touch, a bridge between the past and the future. Explore the collection here and find a gift for yourself or a loved one this winter. By purchasing our merch, you can show your support for our mission of delivering locally sourced, independent journalism from Ukraine to the world.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-independent-launches-winter-merch-collection/	2024-11-27T12:54:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/RUxBqTYw.jpeg
Some commitments from NATO summit in July remain unfulfilled, Zelensky says	Key commitments from NATO&apos;s July summit in Washington, including air defense systems and other military support, have not yet been fully implemented, President Volodymyr Zelensky told NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Nov. 27. &#x201C;This significantly affects the motivation and morale of our people,&quot; he said, emphasizing the need for timely delivery of promised support. Zelensky also raised concerns about Russia&#x2019;s use of new ballistic missiles, urging NATO partners to provide specific air defense systems that are readily available. &quot;The recent authorization of long-range strikes against military targets in Russia has helped. But the pressure on Russia must be maintained and increased at various levels,&quot; Zelensky added. The two leaders also discussed strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s ties with the United States and other allies, ensuring the execution of existing agreements, and advancing efforts for Ukraine&#x2019;s eventual invitation to NATO. While Ukraine didn&#x2019;t get a firm commitment to join NATO at the alliance&#x2019;s summit this year, the 32 allied countries did declare Ukraine&#x2019;s path to membership &#x201C;irreversible&#x201D;. Along with air defense systems, Ukraine was promised $43 billion in funding, a NATO representative in Kyiv, and new bilateral security agreements.	https://kyivindependent.com/some-commitments-from-nato-summit-in-july-remain-unfulfilled-zelensky-says/	2024-11-27T12:44:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2150217708.jpeg
Vertep, a centuries-old Ukrainian Christmas tradition	On New Year&#x2019;s Eve in 1972, a group of Ukrainians set out to carol &#x2014; a seemingly innocent holiday tradition. But for the KGB, the Soviet Union&#x2019;s security services, this was no ordinary celebration. As the carolers moved from house to house, their movements were tracked. The artists and human rights activists that went caroling that night were part of a group known collectively as the Shistdesiatnyky, or Sixtiers in English, for the decade they produced their most celebrated work. The group championed Ukrainian culture and called for social justice in an era defined by Soviet repression. Many of them, including the poet Vasyl Stus, were arrested. A Christmas Vertep in Lviv, Ukraine, in 1972. (Photo from the criminal file of Stefania Shabatura/ Electronic Archive of the Ukrainian Liberation Movement)The KGB wasn&#x2019;t following the group that night for just any caroling &#x2014; it was Vertep, a centuries-old Christmas tradition that has historically been as political as it is aesthetic, embodying centuries of Ukrainian folk culture. The tradition dates back to the 16th-17th centuries and is still practiced across Ukraine today around the Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s holidays. Originally staged as a traveling puppet theater, it is now performed by carolers who dress up in elaborate costumes and sing songs blending religious and folk themes. The colorful casts can include up to 40 characters, ranging from religious figures, shepherds, and peasants to animals. The precise origins of Vertep remain somewhat of a mystery, even for scholars of Ukrainian folk traditions. Some suggest it arrived in Ukraine from western Europe, though people have differing views on exactly where it began. In western Europe, puppet theaters with religious themes &#x2014; like miracle plays depicting saints&#x2019; lives &#x2014; had captivated audiences since the Middle Ages.

(Wikimedia / Mystetskyi Arsenal)Before the second half of the 18th century, when the earliest known text for a Vertep performance was written, this tradition existed as an oral art form. Students of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy &#x2014; Ukraine&apos;s oldest university founded in 1615 &#x2014; most likely played a pivotal role in its rise to prominence during the 18th century. By adapting and enriching Vertep with elements of Ukrainian cultural life, the students transformed it into a dynamic expression of local identity and cultural tradition. All of this unfolded within the Ukrainian Baroque, a vibrant era in Ukraine&#x2019;s history spanning the late 16th to 18th centuries. Shaped by the influence of the Cossacks &#x2014; a semi-nomadic warrior society and early champions of Ukrainian independence &#x2014; this period wove together ideas of resilience and a flourishing of artistic and intellectual life, leaving a lasting imprint on the nation&#x2019;s cultural and political identity. The Vertep theater was traditionally envisioned as a two-tiered wooden structure designed to separate the sacred from the secular. The upper level was for the staging of religious performances, while the lower level was reserved for secular works, ranging from somber tragedies to lively comedic satires. These performances were enhanced by carols or instrumental music, adding a rich auditory dimension to the storytelling. Over the centuries, Vertep evolved but remains a cherished embodiment of the Christmas spirit. Modern celebrations can feature caroling groups adorned in traditional Ukrainian folk costumes or dressed as characters from folklore. These groups often incorporate brief theatrical skits into their caroling, paying homage to Vertep&#x2019;s historical roots. A striking centerpiece of the spectacle is the elaborately crafted star (&#x201C;zvizda&#x201D;), symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem that guided the Magi to the nativity. Vertep performances boast a diverse cast of characters. Notably, the first documented performance, recorded in Poltava Oblast in the late 18th century, included 35 characters. In his 1929 scholarly study &#x201C;Ukrainian Vertep,&#x201D; Yevhen Markovskyi delves into a number of historical versions of the tradition, including the Baturyn Vertep, one of the earliest known renditions. Baturyn, located in modern-day Chernihiv Oblast, was a thriving cultural hub and the capital of the Cossack Hetmanate during the tenure of Hetman Ivan Mazepa.

The narrative&apos;s religious focus centered on the nativity scene, while its secular elements introduced a cast that included a Cossack hero, a young couple, a Romani fortune teller, an elderly Jewish man and woman, soldiers, and a beggar. The Cossack hero in Vertep serves as a powerful symbol of Ukrainian cultural resilience. Pious and courageous yet undeniably charismatic, his performance often brims with humor, adding a dynamic layer to the narrative. At his essence, however, the Cossack embodies the triumph of good over evil, standing as a timeless representation of strength, righteousness, and Ukrainians&#x2019; enduring spirit. The use of satire in Vertep provided a powerful means to confront and publicly critique social injustices. Corrupt noblemen demanding the tribute of the peasantry are not only ridiculed but also often outwitted, effectively subverting the oppressive structures of the social hierarchy. The exaggerated selfishness of these privileged figures served as a comedic tool, but it also highlights their moral shortcomings. In contrast, characters such as the Cossack offer a model for how individuals should rise above the temptations of vice with regard to themselves and their communities. Given its progressive nature, the Soviet regime actively sought to wipe out Vertep, along with other Ukrainian Christmas traditions, such as Malanka, from public life. Religious practices were viewed as a direct challenge to the state&apos;s Communist ideology, threatening the party&apos;s control over the cultural and ideological fabric of society. In an effort to promote a more secular state, the Soviets strategically elevated holidays like New Year&#x2019;s Eve, deliberately sidelining Christmas to reshape Ukraine&#x2019;s cultural identity and suppress its religious roots. It could be argued that once these traditions were labeled as disruptive, they embraced that very designation, as many Ukrainians, resolute in their commitment to preserving their cultural heritage, resisted such efforts. Despite Soviet attempts to suppress them, many Ukrainians succeeded in safeguarding their Christmas traditions. However, the authorities also exploited this resistance as a pretext to target individuals, intensifying their crackdown on cultural expression, such as when the caroling Sixtiers were arrested.

(Artur Widak/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Those who have endeavored to document the Vertep tradition over the centuries have uncovered not only how Ukrainians have preserved this cultural legacy but also how they have enriched it with their own distinct interpretations. Each version of Vertep adds a new layer to the Ukrainian storytelling tradition, further enriching the tapestry of Ukrainian culture and deepening the collective identity of its people. As a writer, 19th-century author Ivan Franko was deeply captivated by the history of Vertep, appreciating not only its rich folk heritage but also its incisive satire, which elegantly critiqued social injustices with both wit and boldness. He understood that trying to capture the diversity of Vertep was vital to preserving the experiences of Ukrainians from all walks of life, especially those who had endured the brutal realities of Russian aggression throughout the centuries. &#x201C;I have no doubt that every newly unearthed text, rescued from oblivion, will contribute at least a small line to the history of our Vertep,&#x201D; Franko wrote in &#x201C;Toward a History of Ukrainian Vertep&#x201D; in 1906. &#x201C;For this reason, they will be recorded, even if only as fragments of our history preserved in folk memory.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/explaining-ukraine-vertep-a-ukrainian-christmas-tradition/	2024-11-27T12:39:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1246098344-1.jpg
North Korea supports Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Umerov says	North Korean forces are &quot;actively supporting&quot; Russian attacks on Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Nov. 27. Umerov did not specify how Pyongyang aids Russian strikes on energy facilities. Throughout the all-out war, North Korea has become Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of ballistic missiles and artillery shells. Russia carried out a massive campaign of aerial attacks against Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure over the spring, similar to the one launched during the fall and winter of 2022-23. Officials have warned that Russia may continue targeting the energy grid as winter approaches. The Ukrainian minister arrived in South Korea earlier on Nov. 27 and discussed &quot;joint steps to enhance security and stability&quot; with the country&apos;s President Yoon Suk Yeol. Umerov also met with National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun. Pyongyang is believed to have dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Kursk Oblast. &quot;For the Republic of Korea, these actions pose a serious threat, as North Korean troops are gaining combat experience, which could present additional security challenges in the region in the future,&quot; Umerov said. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that a rapid supply of arms to Ukraine is unlikely due to South Korea&apos;s legal contains on providing weapons to a combat zone. A South Korean official recently said that direct supplies of 155 mm ammunition are not on the table, with Yoon commenting that Seoul is currently looking at the possibility of providing &quot;defensive weapons,&quot; without providing details.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-supports-russian-attacks-on-ukraines-energy-infrastructure-umerov-says/	2024-11-27T11:59:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185501985.jpg
Ukraine war latest: The Economist estimates 60,000-100,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed in full-scale war	Key developments on Nov. 27: Between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the full-scale war, and 400,000 more are too injured to fight on, according to estimates by The Economist published on Nov. 26. Kyiv has largely avoided revealing the full extent of its military casualties, with President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledging only in February that 31,000 Ukrainian fighters have been killed. Basing its calculations on leaked or published intelligence reports, defense officials, researchers, and open-source intelligence, The Economist wrote that Russia and Ukraine lost a greater share of their population than the U.S. during the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Almost one in 20 Ukrainian fighting-age men have been killed or injured because of the war, The Economist wrote. In September, the Wall Street Journal provided similar estimates, positing that Ukraine had lost 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded. The outlet estimated Russia&apos;s losses at up to 200,000 killed and 400,000 injured. The exact figures for both sides are nearly impossible to establish as Kyiv and Moscow are secretive about their casualties. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. In turn, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces put Russian overall losses at over 735,000 as of Nov. 27. The losses Russia suffered in the full-scale war are believed to be greater than during all the wars since 1945 combined. According to The Economist, civilian casualties are even more difficult to establish but likely reach many tens of thousands. The U.N. mission in Ukraine verified that 11,743 civilians were killed as of the summer, but the number is likely higher due to Russia barring access for monitors to occupied territories, namely to areas that likely saw the heaviest civilian casualties like Mariupol. Ukrainian drones and missiles attacked the seaside city of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Nov. 27, the city&apos;s Russian-installed proxy head, Mikhail Razvozhayev, claimed. Russian air defenses shot down two missiles and five drones, Razvozhayev said, claiming that the Ukrainian projectiles were downed over the water. Drone debris also reportedly fell near the Kacha highway. The pro-Ukrainian Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported explosions and active air defense in Sevastopol, as well as near the Belbek military airfield and elsewhere on the occupied peninsula. The channel also shared a photo of the Nakhimov Naval Academy with smoke coming from behind it. The authenticity of the footage or the cause of the smoke could not be immediately verified. The Mash Telegram channel alleged that around 40 drones, Neptune missiles, and unidentified cruise missiles were flying toward the northwestern part of the Crimean peninsula. All projectiles were shot down, the channel wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukrainian soldiers repelled an attempted Russian offensive in the Zaporizhzhia sector, General Oleksandr Pivnenko, the commander of Ukraine&apos;s National Guard, said on Nov.27. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, saying Moscow was deploying trained assault groups to front-line positions in mid-November. Ukraine&apos;s Spartan Brigade aerial reconnaissance spotted Russian troops planning to attack the National Guard positions with an infantry group in advance, Pivnenko said, sharing footage showing the attack. He did not specify the scale of the attack or the number of Russian troops involved in the offensive. According to the commander, Russia is mostly trying to conduct assaults and reconnaissance attacks in the Zaporizhzhia sector with infantry groups consisting of 3 to 10 people. &quot;The enemy rarely uses equipment,&quot; Pivnenko said. &quot;But our soldiers destroy enemy personnel and firepower quickly and accurately.&quot; The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump nominated former national security advisor to the vice president, retired General Keith Kellogg, as a special Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on an end to Russia&apos;s full-scale war, Trump announced on Nov. 27. &quot;Together, we will secure peace through strength and make America ang the world safe again,&quot; Trump said on his social media network Truth Social. In June, Reuters reported that Kellogg and another Trump&apos;s top advisor, Frederick H. Fleitz, proposed him a plan that would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia. The two also reportedly proposed to freeze the front lines in their current position and take Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession off the table. Keith Kellogg, 80, previously served as the Executive Secretary and Chief of Staff of the U.S. National Security Council in the first Trump administration. He also was a top advisor to then U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. Last week, Reuters reported that Trump was considering his former intelligence director, diplomat Richard Grenell, as a special Ukrainian peace envoy.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-the-economist-estimates-60-000-100-000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-full-scale-war/	2024-11-27T11:57:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2161908083.jpg

Ukraine approves homemade Oncilla-Shturm armored personnel carrier for military use	The Ukrainian-made Oncilla-Shturm armored personnel carrier has been approved for military use, the Defense Ministry said on Nov. 27. &quot;The domestic Oncilla-Shturm armored vehicle demonstrates Ukraine&apos;s progress in creating equipment that meets the modern needs of the battlefield,&quot; Deputy Defense Minister Dmytro Klimenkov said. The vehicle can carry three crew members and six riflemen. The Oncilla-Shturm armor protects soldiers from small arms fire, debris and explosive ordnance, according to the ministry. &quot;Its reliability and functionality allow our military to perform combat missions in highly complex conditions, ensuring the protection of personnel and the effectiveness of operations,&quot; Klimenkov said. Armed with a remote-controlled combat module with a large-caliber machine gun, the vehicle can cover travel more than 700 kilometers (434 miles). The Oncilla-Shturm can be produced in several modifications, the ministry said. Kyiv began actively developing its defense production after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, which includes long-range missiles and drones.

Opinion: Georgescu’s rise exposes the fragility of Romania’s pro-European consensus	The meteoric rise of hardcore nationalist C&#x103;lin Georgescu in Romania&#x2019;s first-round presidential election over the weekend is nothing short of remarkable. Georgescu surged from just a few percentage points in polls weeks before the vote to claim over 23% of the electorate, defeating candidates from the country&#x2019;s two most established parties. Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and former Liberal (PNL) Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuc&#x103; of the National Liberal Party (PNL) finished third and fifth, respectively. Since the fall of Communism in 1989, PSD and PNL candidates have typically dominated second-round runoffs. Georgescu will now face the pro-European Union reform candidate from the USR party, Elena Lasconi, in the Dec. 1 runoff. Georgescu&#x2019;s victory is being framed as another win for a politician sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin, following the likes of Viktor Orb&#xE1;n in Hungary, Robert Fico in Slovakia, and the Georgian Dream party in Georgia. Georgescu has openly expressed admiration for Putin, shared panels with Russian nationalist thinker Alexander Dugin, and criticized Western and NATO policies toward Ukraine and the region. While there are elements of pro-Russian, anti-Western rhetoric in his campaign &#x2014; tapping into widespread war fatigue in Romania and across Europe &#x2014; there are broader implications to consider. Georgescu&#x2019;s campaign underscores the power of social media in modern elections and the potential risks to democratic integrity. His last-minute, highly effective outreach on TikTok and other platforms connected with a broader, particularly younger, audience. While this can be celebrated for expanding political engagement, concerns remain over campaign financing and the truthfulness of such efforts. Allegations of Russian funding and bot activity &#x2014; similar to issues raised during Moldova&#x2019;s recent presidential election &#x2014; have raised questions about foreign interference and electoral fairness. Populism thrives in the current global political climate, fueled by concerns over immigration and the lingering effects of the cost-of-living crisis post-COVID. Georgescu&#x2019;s campaign, like MAGA in the U.S., resonates with disenchanted voters who feel ignored by establishment parties. His messaging combines nationalism with a dose of xenophobia, appealing to socially conservative and economically strained constituencies. Georgescu&#x2019;s rise reflects a broader trend of incumbent parties losing ground globally, from U.S. President Joe Biden and the Democrats in the U.S. to the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#x2019;s Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey to Narendra Modi&#x2019;s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. In Romania, the PSD and PNL are facing unprecedented challenges, mirroring the struggles of governing parties in other democracies.

(Daniel Mihailescu / AFP via Getty Images)Liberal politicians in Western democracies may be overestimating public support for progressive reforms. In socially conservative countries like Romania, campaigns emphasizing &#x201C;traditional values&#x201D; often gain traction by opposing liberal policies, particularly those related to LGBTQ+ rights. Putin and similar figures exploit this divide, presenting themselves as defenders of tradition while masking autocratic and kleptocratic practices. In Romania, many rural voters perceive the EU as both a source of funding and a purveyor of socially liberal policies that conflict with their values. Despite Georgescu&#x2019;s first-round success, all is not lost for pro-EU forces in Romania. First, Georgescu secured only 23% of the vote in the first round. Even if votes from nationalist candidate George Simion are added, his total would still fall short of the 50%-plus-one needed in the runoff. Meanwhile, pro-EU candidates collectively received 58% of the first-round vote. Most parties have endorsed Lasconi, and the PSD leadership is likely to follow, aiming to maintain access to substantial EU structural funds. Second, Romania is the largest net recipient of EU funding, with over 83 billion euros ($87.4 billion) allocated under the 2021&#x2013;2027 budget cycle. These funds account for 3-4% of Romania&#x2019;s GDP annually, covering significant budget deficits. A Georgescu presidency could jeopardize these flows, as seen with Orb&#xE1;n in Hungary. Romanian voters may hesitate to risk economic stability by supporting him. Third, Romania&#x2019;s history &#x2014; its alliance with Nazi Germany during World War II, followed by decades under Soviet control &#x2014; has left deep scars. While Georgescu appeals to a conservative base, most Romanians remain wary of Russia. Moldova&#x2019;s recent pro-EU victory in a similar election suggests a comparable outcome is possible in Romania. And finally, Romania&#x2019;s parliamentary-presidential system restricts the president&#x2019;s authority. Without a strong party base, Georgescu is unlikely to dominate parliamentary elections, which will likely result in a fragmented legislature. A pro-EU coalition remains the most viable path to a stable majority, ensuring Romania&#x2019;s Western orientation endures even if Georgescu wins the presidency.	https://kyivindependent.com/opinion-georgescus-rise-exposes-the-fragility-of-romanias-pro-european-consensus/	2024-11-27T06:11:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2186353250.jpg
South Korean president meets Ukraine's delegation to discuss Moscow-Pyongyang ties	South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met a Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in Seoul on Nov. 27 to discuss the deepening military ties between Russia and North Korea, the Yonhap news agency reported. Several media outlets reported that the Ukrainian delegation is visiting Seoul to seek arms supplies, something the East Asian country has been reluctant to provide. More recently, Yoon said that the South Korean government is not ruling out changing its stance and providing defense support in light of North Korea&apos;s dispatch of troops to Russia. During the meeting, the two sides &quot;agreed to continue sharing information on North Korea&apos;s troop deployment to Russia and on weapons and technology transfers between Russia and North Korea, while working together with allied nations,&quot; the South Korean Presidential Office said, according to Yonhap. Ukrainian officials also reportedly met with National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun to discuss intelligence on North Korean troops. Pyongyang is believed to have dispatched over 10,000 troops to aid Russia&apos;s war, with the first clashes with Ukrainian forces reported in Kursk Oblast. North Korea has also become Moscow&apos;s leading supplier of artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Neither the Ukrainian delegation nor South Korean officials commented on whether Umerov arrived in Seoul to seek military supplies. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that a rapid supply of arms to Ukraine is unlikely due to South Korea&apos;s legal contains on providing weapons to a combat zone. A recent poll also showed that while the majority of South Koreans see the growing Russian-North Korean ties as a threat, 82% oppose sending arms to Ukraine. According to the experts, South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition supplies. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns. A South Korean official recently said that direct supplies of 155 mm ammunition are not on the table, with Yoon commenting that Seoul is currently looking at the possibility of providing &quot;defensive weapons,&quot; without providing details.	https://kyivindependent.com/umerov-yoon/	2024-11-27T05:52:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161646683.jpg
Slovak PM accepts Putin's invitation to Moscow Victory Day celebrations	Slovakia&apos;s Ukraine-skeptic Prime Minister Robert Fico accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s invitation to attend the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May, Fico announced on Nov. 27. Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow&apos;s talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war. &quot;The Red Army and the nations of the former Soviet Union played an irreplaceable role in defeating fascism and the victory in World War II,&quot; Fico said on Facebook. &quot;The Slovak government values the legacy of the struggle against fascism, the historical truth about World War II, and the role played by the Red Army... That is why I was happy to accept the official invitation by Russian Presiden Vladimir Putin to attend these important celebrations, which I will.&quot; Fico&apos;s planned visit comes as another jab at the Western efforts to internationally isolate Putin over Russia&apos;s full-scale war in Ukraine. Slovakia is a member state of both NATO and the EU. The Kremlin uses the annual victory celebrations for propaganda purposes and to showcase its military might, while Russian propaganda leans heavily on the Soviet victory in World War II. Putin has repeatedly hurled false accusations of fascist and Nazi tendencies against the Ukrainian government after the EuroMaidan Revolution, presenting the full-scale invasion as an effort to &quot;de-Nazify&quot; the country. Echoing the Kremlin&apos;s propaganda talking points, Fico said in 2023 that the war in Ukraine began in 2014 because of &quot;Ukrainian fascists&quot; killing &quot;ethnic Russian civilians.&quot; He also said this year in September that some of Ukraine&apos;s units have links to fascism and Nazism, leading to a rebuke from Kyiv. Last month, Fico appeared in an online interview with sanctioned Russian propagandist Olga Skabeyeva, claiming that the West grows tired of supporting Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/fico-victory-day-moscow/	2024-11-27T05:12:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1957977106.jpg
Opinion: Georgia’s civil society is the last line of defense for democracy	Georgia finds itself at a crossroads. The Oct. 26 elections, in which the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory, have brought to the surface deep concerns about the integrity of our democracy. Civil society organizations, independent media, and the international democratic community have all raised alarms about widespread irregularities during the vote &#x2014; violations that are hard to ignore. Moreover, the Georgian Dream party has systematically worked to silence independent voices and consolidate power. This assault on civil society, reminiscent of Russia&#x2019;s playbook, threatens to derail Georgia&apos;s European aspirations but has not broken the spirit of our resilient civil society. The recent adoption of legislation mirroring Russia&apos;s notorious &#x201C;foreign agents&#x201D; law represents a direct attack on Georgia&apos;s vibrant civil society and independent media landscape. This law, coupled with the ruling party&apos;s abuse of administrative resources and pressure on democratic institutions, reveals a troubling pattern: Georgian Dream appears more focused on maintaining power than on fulfilling the Georgian people&apos;s European aspirations. The consequences of these actions are already visible. The European Union, concerned by the worsening democratic backsliding and violations of the rule of law, has effectively paused Georgia&apos;s integration process. It is a bitter blow for many Georgians, who have repeatedly expressed overwhelming support for European integration through peaceful protests, civic activism, and electoral participation. Amid these challenges, Georgia&#x2019;s civil society has shown remarkable resilience. Ahead of the elections, Georgian Dream, determined to minimize independent oversight and criticism, took further drastic measures. However, these challenges have only strengthened our resolve. Georgia&apos;s civil society has decades of experience operating under pressure. We understand that our work is more crucial now than ever. Civil society organizations in Georgia have faced significant pressure under the Georgian Dream that reflect a broader pattern of efforts by the ruling party to control political discourse and suppress opposition from civil society, undermining the critical role that CSOs play in holding the government accountable. Many CSOs report being subject to smear campaigns and negative media coverage, often being portrayed as foreign agents or enemies of the state. Employees and their family members have received anonymous threatening calls related to their work, while their offices and homes have been vandalized with insulting and threatening messages. Despite facing unprecedented pressure, our organizations have managed: to monitor electoral processes and document violations; provide crucial support to vulnerable populations, filling gaps in social services; advocate for media pluralism, judicial independence, and anti-corruption reforms; and facilitate dialogue between Georgian society and European partners.

(Vano Shlamov / AFP via Getty Images)The ruling party&#x2019;s attempts to label civil society organizations as an &quot;enemy&quot; deliberately misrepresent our role. We are Georgian citizens working tirelessly for our country&#x2019;s democratic development. Our work serves the interests of Georgian society. The international community&#x2019;s role remains vital. While Georgian Dream may attempt to isolate civil society domestically, our international partners&#x2019; continued support and engagement provide essential backing for democratic forces within Georgia. This support must continue and intensify, focusing on facilitating contacts between Georgian citizens and the EU, monitoring and responding to democratic backsliding, and supporting independent media and civil society organizations. Despite the challenges we face, Georgia&#x2019;s civil society remains committed to our European future. Our work is not just about defending specific organizations or laws; it&#x2019;s about defending the values that Georgia&#x2019;s democratic future depends on. We continue to fight, knowing that the road to Europe runs through a strong, independent civil society. The government&#x2019;s pressure tactics may create obstacles, but they will not stop us. Our message to the international community is clear: Georgia&#x2019;s civil society stands firm. We need your continued support to overcome these challenges and restore momentum toward European integration. This struggle is not just about today&#x2019;s elections or a handful of laws; it&#x2019;s about the future of Georgia as a democratic, European state. Civil society will continue to fight for a Georgia where democracy isn&#x2019;t just a promise but a reality. The ruling party may try to pull us backward, but we remain focused on the long-term goal: a democratic, European Georgia, where the rights and voices of all its citizens are respected.

The Economist estimates 60,000-100,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed in full-scale war	Between 60,000 to 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the full-scale war, and 400,000 more are too injured to fight on, according to estimates by The Economist published on Nov. 26. Kyiv has largely avoided revealing the full extent of its military casualties, with President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledging only in February that 31,000 Ukrainian fighters have been killed. Basing its calculations on leaked or published intelligence reports, defense officials, researchers, and open-source intelligence, The Economist wrote that Russia and Ukraine lost a greater share of their population than the U.S. during the Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Almost one in 20 Ukrainian fighting-age men have been killed or injured because of the war, The Economist wrote. In September, the Wall Street Journal provided similar estimates, positing that Ukraine had lost 80,000 soldiers killed and 400,000 wounded. The outlet estimated Russia&apos;s losses at up to 200,000 killed and 400,000 injured. The exact figures for both sides are nearly impossible to establish as Kyiv and Moscow are secretive about their casualties. The last figure provided by Russian authorities was 5,937 killed soldiers as of September 2022. In turn, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces put Russian overall losses at over 735,000 as of Nov. 27. The losses Russia suffered in the full-scale war are believed to be greater than during all the wars since 1945 combined. According to The Economist, civilian casualties are even more difficult to establish but likely reach many tens of thousands. The U.N. mission in Ukraine verified that 11,743 civilians were killed as of the summer, but the number is likely higher due to Russia barring access for monitors to occupied territories, namely to areas that likely saw the heaviest civilian casualties like Mariupol.	https://kyivindependent.com/economist-casualties-estimates/	2024-11-27T04:28:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1770366748.jpg
NGO warns that lack of funding threatens critical medical evacuation work in Ukraine	The international humanitarian organization MOAS&apos;s front-line medical evacuation operation is &quot;on the verge of extinction&quot; due to a lack of funding, the group said on Nov. 27, appealing to the international community to support their work. MOAS&apos;s team of all-Ukrainian medics has been evacuating and keeping alive critically injured troops during the three years of the full-scale war, with the group saying their work has saved 62,000 lives. &quot;Now, with funding virtually exhausted, one of Ukraine&apos;s most remarkable lifesaving operations is on the verge of extinction,&quot; their press release read. The group said that without funding, it can sustain its operations only until the end of 2024. &quot;MOAS is keeping soldiers alive day in, day out. It&apos;s an expensive and challenging business, and we simply can&apos;t continue into 2025 without additional funding,&quot; Christopher Catrambone, MOAS&apos;s founder who has been based in Kyiv since the outbreak of the full-scale war, told the Kyiv Independent. MOAS is now in talks with donors in North America and Europe, as well as the U.K. government, to be able to continue its work next year. &quot;The facts are simple. If we have to stop our operation, huge numbers of Ukrainian soldiers will die. In the words of a Ukrainian general, it will be a complete catastrophe,&quot; Catrambone said separately in the press release. &quot;They&#x2019;re overstretched and cannot do what we do. Nor can any other NGO in Ukraine. That&#x2019;s why today, we are launching this urgent appeal for support. It&#x2019;s our last throw of the dice, it&#x2019;s do or die.&quot; According to MOAS, the monthly cost of a 150-strong medical team with 50 &quot;state of the art ambulances&quot; costs $1 million, comparable to the price tag of a Storm Shadow missile. &quot;We&apos;re incredibly grateful to all the donors who have made our lifesaving operation possible,&quot; Catrambone told the Kyiv Independent, explaining that MOAS&apos;s donors include wealthy philanthropists, tech billionaires, foundations, and smaller donors. The founder said he was unsure why the funding was drying up, suggesting that some had found other causes to support or simply lost interest in the war in Ukraine. &quot;But what I&apos;m focused on is getting donors now so we can continue saving lives at the medical frontline in Ukraine,&quot; he stressed.	https://kyivindependent.com/moas/	2024-11-27T03:39:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/medics.jpg
Ex-Minister Kuleba skeptical about peace prospects during Trump's presidency	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is unlikely to bring a peace deal to Ukraine as Russian President Vladimir Putin still believes he can achieve all his goals, ex-Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Politico in an interview published on Nov. 27. According to Ukraine&apos;s former diplomacy chief, Ukraine is a &quot;personal obsession for Putin&quot; but also a way to &quot;show to the world how the West is incapable of defending itself or what it stands for.&quot; Trump has criticized military support provided to Ukraine by the Biden administration and pledged to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war. While the details of his plans remain elusive, some reports indicate this would entail forcing Ukraine to cede territory and at least temporarily give up on its NATO accession plans. Trump&apos;s approach is more likely to starve Ukraine of weapons and cause the front to collapse, allowing Russian forces to move up to the cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Poltava, Kuleba said. Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelensky also cannot sign a peace deal that would recognize occupied territories as Russian and forego Kyiv&apos;s NATO aspirations, as such a step would be against the Constitution and Zelensky&apos;s political end, Kuleba believes. Zelensky recently told Fox News that Ukraine would never recognize Russian occupation but admitted that Crimea would have to be liberated through diplomatic means. He also appealed to the international community to help bring about a diplomatic and just end of the war next year. While voicing hopes that Putin will make a mistake in handling Trump that will antagonize the soon-to-be U.S. president, Kuleba said that Europe&apos;s stance will be decisive. Leading European countries like the U.K., France, and Poland pledged to ramp up their support for Kyiv. The situation in Germany, Ukraine&apos;s largest European donor, remains uncertain as the country is heading toward snap elections in February. The ex-minister also complained that while Russia found allies willing to send their own troops, like North Korea, Kyiv&apos;s partners are unwilling to even commit sufficient weapons. Kuleba concluded that, unlike Russia and Ukraine, the West does not have a clear goal and does not know what it is fighting for.	https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-trump/	2024-11-27T03:22:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160533255.jpg
Russia claims Ukraine's drones, missiles attacked Crimea, explosion reported near airfield	Ukrainian drones and missiles attacked the seaside city of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Nov. 27, the city&apos;s Russian-installed proxy head, Mikhail Razvozhayev, claimed. Russian air defenses shot down two missiles and five drones, Razvozhayev said, claiming that the Ukrainian projectiles were downed over the water. Drone debris also reportedly fell near the Kacha highway. The pro-Ukrainian Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported explosions and active air defense in Sevastopol, as well as near the Belbek military airfield and elsewhere on the occupied peninsula. The channel also shared a photo of the Nakhimov Naval Academy with smoke coming from behind it. The authenticity of the footage or the cause of the smoke could not be immediately verified. The Mash Telegram channel alleged that around 40 drones, Neptune missiles, and unidentified cruise missiles were flying toward the northwestern part of the Crimean peninsula. All projectiles were shot down, the channel wrote. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian military and industrial targets in Sevastopol and elsewhere in Crimea during the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/crimea-attack/	2024-11-27T02:18:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1245749130.jpg
UK cabinet members on list of those barred from entering Russia	Russia&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry barred 30 U.K. nationals, including lawmakers, journalists, and ministers like Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Finance Minister Rachel Reeves, from entering its territory in a decision published on Nov. 26. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, and Ed Miliband, the climate secretary, were also on the list. The decision came shortly after the U.K. decided to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territories with Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and after London imposed its largest package of sanctions against Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of oil tankers. In the statement, the Foreign Ministry named &quot;Russophobic policies,&quot; &quot;dissemination of disinformation about our country,&quot; and &quot;military support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces&quot; as indicative of &quot;London&#x2019;s attitude towards further systemic confrontation with respect to Russia.&quot; At the G20 summit in Brazil on Nov. 20, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government was &quot;doubling down&quot; on its support for Ukraine but avoided disclosing specifics. Ukraine had previously used Storm Shadows against Russian forces in the Black Sea, though the U.K. government has not confirmed the total number supplied since the war began. The sanctions come as the latest turn in a diplomatic spat that began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-cabinet-members-on-list-of-those-barred-from-entering-russia/	2024-11-27T01:45:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2156747238.jpg
Ukraine receives $4.8 billion from World Bank	Ukraine has received a $4.8 billion loan from the World Bank through the PEACE project for social expenditures, Prime Minister Denys Shymhal said on Nov. 27. &quot;We are very grateful to the United States and the development partners who are financing assistance under the PEACE project,&quot; Shmyhal said on X. As the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion continues to put pressure on Ukraine&apos;s economy, the World Bank plays a crucial role in supporting the country. The Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance Project (PEACE) helps to provide funding for pensions, support for internally displaced persons (IDP), and salaries for teachers, first responders, and other state employees. &quot;We thank the World Bank for its continued commitment and active support of initiatives that strengthen Ukraine.&quot; Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and the World Bank&apos;s Eastern Europe Operations Manager Kevin Tomlinson signed the agreement for the loan on Nov. 22. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, about $35.5 billion has already been allocated through the PEACE project to support social expenditures of Ukraine&apos;s State Budget, Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-receives-4-8-billion-from-world-bank/	2024-11-27T01:09:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243546154.jpeg
Russia's ruble sinks to 2022 March levels after US sanctions on Gazprombank	Russia&#x2019;s ruble took a blow following the news of the U.S. imposing sanctions on 50 Russian banks, including Gazprombank, hitting 108 against the U.S. dollar during early morning trade on Nov. 27. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials on Nov. 21, sending the U.S. &#xA0;dollar to a more than two-and-a half year high against the rouble. Until now, the U.S. had avoided targeting Gazprombank in order to enable European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank serves as the main conduit for energy-related payments, the Financial Times reported. With this channel closed, international payments for Russian oil and gas will be harder, drying up a part of the Kremlin&#x2019;s foreign currency revenue. This will cause the ruble to weaken above the psychological barrier of 100 to the U.S. dollar. Gazprombank, partially owned by Russia&apos;s state-run energy giant Gazprom, was also used to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. The ruble is expected to weaken further with the beginning of the winter holiday season, as companies have to import more goods from abroad to satisfy increased consumer demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/ruble-gazprombank/	2024-11-27T00:35:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258690185.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 2, injure 17 over past day	Russian strikes against Ukraine killed at least two civilians and injured at least 17 over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 27. Russia attacked Ukraine with 89 Shahed-type drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles overnight, the Air Force reported. Thirty-six were shot down by air defenses while 48 were lost across Ukraine, likely thanks to electronic warfare means, the statement read. Five drones reportedly flew to Belarus, Russia, and occupied territories. Some of the drones targeted the capital city of Kyiv overnight. Two people were injured when drone debris fell on a non-residential building, the city&apos;s military administration reported. Drone debris also damaged houses and apartment buildings elsewhere in Kyiv Oblast. Russian attacks against Sumy Oblast killed two people and injured one, the regional military administration reported. The two fatalities were reported after a Russian missile struck a residential building and kindergarten in the city of Sumy. One civilian was also injured during Russian attacks against the Velyka Pysarivka community near the Russian border, officials said. In Donetsk Oblast, two people were injured in the village of Zhovte, and one in the town of Pokrovsk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast injured 11 people, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. A high-rise building, 10 houses, a gas pipeline, a car repair shop, a garage, and cars were damaged. Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, and Zhytomyr oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-107/	2024-11-27T00:07:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Lysak-Nov-27.jpg
Russia using bombers it received from Ukraine in 1999, RFE/RL reports	Russia actively uses at least six Tu-160-type bombers that Ukraine gave to Russia in 1999 as a payment of gas debt, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&apos;s (RFE/RL) Schemes&apos; investigation showed on Nov. 26. The investigation also identified pilots flying the planes and launching missile strikes against Ukraine. Russia regularly uses its strategic aviation to attack cities and infrastructure across Ukraine. Ukraine handed over Tu-160 supersonic heavy bombers in 1999 as part of a larger debt payment for Russian gas. The journalists identified the planes by comparing their old serial numbers in archives and aviation registries. RFE/RL was also able to identify some pilots flying these planes against Ukraine, like Oleg Skytskyi, a serviceman of the 22nd Aviation Division, which Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) says is &quot;responsible for numerous victims and destruction in Ukraine,&quot; one of them likely being launching a missile that killed an RFE/RL journalist in Kyiv on April 28, 2022. In the 1999 arms transfer, Kyiv transferred to Moscow eight Tu-160 and three Tu-95MS heavy bombers, as well as 575 Kh-55 cruise missiles, with Russia writing off $275 million in gas debt, 10% of the assets&apos; real value. The transferred Kh-55 missiles were also used against Ukraine, an earlier investigation by Radio Free showed. The Tu-160 strategic bombers are among the biggest warplanes ever operated, but they are only sparsely used due to maintenance problems. They were the latest heavy strategic bombers designed in the Soviet Union, capable of carrying conventional and nuclear weaponry. Their last use was on Nov. 17, when Russia launched one of the largest aerial strikes on Ukraine, killing seven civilians and damaging its energy grid.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-ukraine-bombers-rferl/	2024-11-26T23:29:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-472748686.jpg
Biden asking US Congress for $24 billion in Ukraine aid, arms replenishment, Politico reports	U.S. President Joe Biden is quietly asking the U.S. Congress to greenlight an additional $24 billion in assistance to Ukraine and to replenish provided weapons before he leaves office, Politico Pro reported on Nov. 26, citing an obtained document. The news comes amid the Biden administration&apos;s efforts to ship in as much aid to Ukraine as possible before Donald Trump, who has criticized military support for Kyiv, takes office in January. Roughly $16 billion of the sum would be used to restock U.S. arsenals, while the remaining &#xA0;$8 billion would go to the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), the outlet wrote. The USAI is a Pentagon-led program for supplying arms to Ukraine through contracts with U.S. defense companies. Two congressional sources confirmed the information for Politico and said that Congress received the request on Nov. 25. The White House suggested that Congress could include the assistance in its effort to avert a government shut down next month, according to the document obtained by Politico. The report aligns with earlier statements from Biden&apos;s team that the White House would seek Congress&apos; approval for additional aid for Ukraine in 2025. In recent days, the Biden administration has made a series of decisions aimed at giving Kyiv leverage in future negotiations. These steps included approving the delivery of anti-personnel mines and granting permission for Ukraine to launch U.S.-made long-range ATACMS at targets within Russia. The request for additional funding has already received pushback from critics of Washington&apos;s pro-Ukraine policy. Republican Senator and Trump&apos;s ally Mike Lee said that &quot;Congress must not give him (Biden) a free gift to further sabotage President Trump&#x2019;s peace negotiations on the way out the door.&quot; Trump said he would seek to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. While the details of his plan remain unclear, some reports indicate it might entail Ukraine ceding territory and at least temporarily foregoing its NATO aspirations. It remains unclear whether the funding request will be successful, as Congress &#x2013; namely the Republican-led House of Representatives &#x2013; stalled an earlier $61 billion assistance bill for months before finally approving it in April. The November elections reinforced Republican control over the legislature, as the party also secured the majority in the Senate. The new Congress will be sworn in in early January.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-24-billion-politico/	2024-11-26T22:47:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 735,410 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 735,410 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 27. This number includes 1,580 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,449 tanks, 19,304 armored fighting vehicles, 30,126 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,830 artillery systems, 1,255 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,005 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,616 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-735-410-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-26T22:27:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258947571.jpg
Umerov-led delegation arrives in South Korea seeking weapons, military aid, media reports	A Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov arrived in South Korea on Nov. 27, with the aim of requesting military aid from Seoul, several media outlets reported. The delegation is expected to meet with President Yoon Suk Yeol as early as Wednesday, according to the Korean Times, citing several sources close to the matter. Yoon has previously said that the country does not rule out providing arms to Ukraine in the light of deepening cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. Russian-North Korean relations entered a new level when Pyongyang dispatched around 11,000 troops to join Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine. A vast majority of the deployed North Korean troops are currently receiving training alongside Russian forces, preparing to attempt to regain control of Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Ahead of the planned meeting, the delegation has reportedly met with South Korean National Security Adviser and former Defense Minister Shin Won-sik, according to the South Korean media outlet Dong-a Ilbo. South Korea&apos;s government has not yet confirmed the arrival of the Ukrainian delegation. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine would provide South Korea with a detailed request for military support in an October interview with KBS. South Korea has thus far resisted supplying lethal arms to Ukraine and instead opted to provide financial, and humanitarian support alongside non-lethal aid, citing legislative restrictions. Some media reports from last year claimed that the country secretly supplied artillery shells to Ukraine via the U.S., though the South Korean government denied the reports. Living in constant tension with its North Korean neighbors, South Korea boasts a powerful military and strong defense industry, making the country a major arms exporter. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that South Korea could provide the most significant support to Ukraine through ammunition supplies. The country fields not only 155 mm artillery but also stores 3.4 million 105 mm rounds compatible with some of Ukraine&apos;s guns.	https://kyivindependent.com/umerov-led-delegation-arrives-in-seoul-to-request-weapons-military-aid-media-reports/	2024-11-26T21:54:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/korea.jpeg
NATO-Ukraine Council convenes following Russia's use of Oreshnik missile	The NATO-Ukraine Council convened at a meeting on Nov. 26 in response to Russia&apos;s use of the new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; the NATO alliance said in a news release. According to the release, senior Ukrainian military officials briefed members of the council via a video link. The meeting was held at NATO headquarters in Brussels at the ambassadorial level. Russia first launched the weapon in an attack against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon.&quot; Zelensky contradicted Putin&apos;s claim on Nov. 24, saying experts were currently analyzing the wreckage of the missile and working with allies to put together a suitable response. &quot;Deploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,&quot; NATO Spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said earlier in a statement by the alliance, referring to the use of IRBMs. NATO added in its statement that Russia&#x2019;s use of the Oreshnik missile is an attempt to terrorize the civilian population of Ukraine and scare those who support Ukraine in its defense against Russia&apos;s &quot;illegal and unprovoked aggression.&quot; During the discussions, Ukraine further emphasized the need for support from NATO allies to strengthen its air defense against such future attacks. Russia has continued to attack Ukrainian targets ahead of an expected harsh winter amid Russia strike on energy infrastructure. Overnight on Nov. 25, Russia launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine, with Ukrainian air defenses reportedly being able to down 76 drones across 17 oblasts. On Nov. 25, delegates from NATO member states&#x2019; legislatures voiced their support for Ukraine becoming the 33rd member of the alliance in a resolution adopted by the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Independent from NATO, the assembly has no direct role in overseeing NATO policies.	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-ukraine-council-convenes-following-russias-use-of-oreshnik-missile/	2024-11-26T20:59:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2160995421.jpg
Turkey in talks with US over sanctions exemption for Russian natural gas payments	Turkey is in talks with the United States in an effort to receive a sanctions waiver to further continue payments for Russian natural gas imports, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said on Nov. 25. The United States introduced new sanctions on Nov. 21, targeting dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials. Bayraktar said that the country is seeking a sanctions exemption for Gazprombank, which Ankara uses to pay Moscow to secure Turkish energy supplies. Presently, Russia stands as Turkey&apos;s primary provider of natural gas, supplying over 40% of its consumption last year. &quot;These sanctions will affect Turkey. We cannot pay, if we cannot pay we cannot buy the goods. The foreign ministry is in talks,&quot; Bayraktar told reporters. The U.S. had previously refrained from targeting Gazprombank to allow European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank is the primary channel for energy-related payments. Despite the past restraint, the U.S. Treasury Department said that the most recent sanctions &quot;will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.&quot; The Financial Times noted in its reporting that Russia used Gazprombank to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. &quot;If such an exemption is not granted to Turkey it will directly impact us. At this point Russia is not the target, Turkey is the direct target,&quot; Bayraktar added. The new U.S. sanctions are intended to close one of Russia&apos;s few remaining avenues for international banking, barring Gazprombank from conducting transactions in dollars. Turkey began discussions on the sanctions exemption with the United States when it was notified of the incoming sanctions. Both countries are still discussing a possible waiver.

Ukraine not opposed to exhumation of Volyn massacre victims on its territory, Foreign Ministry says	Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry said in a joint statement with Poland on Nov. 26 that there were &quot;no obstacles&quot; for Poland to conduct exhumation work on the victims of the Volyn massacre of World War II, amid previous tension over with matter with Warsaw. &quot;Each family has the right to honor the memory of their ancestors with dignity,&quot; Ukrainian &#xA0;Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a statement. &quot;We are working on practical mechanisms to resolve matters related to searches and exhumations. The joint release issued by both countries foreign ministries, which comes as Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha makes his first trip to Poland since being appointed to the post, does not explicitly mention the Volyn massacre but instead refers to &quot;historical&quot; misunderstandings between the two countries. The Volyn massacres took place in 1943 during World War II on the territory of Nazi-occupied Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). Thousands of Ukrainians were also killed in retaliation. The Volyn massacres are a contentious topic between Ukraine and Poland and have often led to soured diplomatic relations. During a Sept. 13 meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and President Volodymyr Zelensky, Sikorski demanded Ukraine finally allow the exhumation of the victims of the Volyn massacre and warned against expecting a quick EU accession, sparking frustration from Zelensky, according to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s sources familiar with the matter. Ukraine&apos;s president reportedly accused Warsaw of politicizing historical events, falling short on promised military aid, and not fully backing Ukraine&apos;s path to EU membership. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz also said in July that Ukraine will not join the EU without resolving the historical issue of the mass killings of Poles in Volyn. The Defense Minister&apos;s comments saw a mixed reaction from other officials in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda saying that threats to block Ukraine&apos;s accession to the European Union are in line with Kremlin policy. The joint release, which sought to ease tensions over the issue, indicated that both foreign ministries would oversee a joint Ukrainian-Polish working group to carry out the exhumation of the victims. In a statement following the joint release, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the agreement is &quot;key to the full reconciliation between our nations, so necessary at this dramatic moment in our shared history.&quot; In early October, the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance&apos;s announced that it plans to search for the remains of victims of the Volyn massacre, which the Polish Foreign Ministry called a &quot;step in the right direction.&quot; Despite historical grievances, Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-not-opposed-to-the-exhumation-of-volyn-massacre-victims-on-its-territory-foreign-ministry-says/	2024-11-26T18:55:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-452718472.jpg
Russian attack on residential building, kindergarten in Sumy kills 2	A Russian missile attack on Nov. 26 struck a residential building and kindergarten in the city of Sumy, leaving at least two people dead, the Sumy Oblast Military Administration reported. The Russian missile, which was reportedly launched at a vehicle service station, also struck a nearby multi-story residential building and caused damage inside a nearby kindergarten, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. One more person may still be trapped under the ruble at the site of the attack as emergency services continue their work. The attack on the city also damaged 13 cars, Suspilne reported. The attack on the regional capital comes as Russia shelled Sumy Oblast 120 times on Nov. 26 in 21 attacks on the region, according to the regional military administration. An explosive dropped from a Russian drone also injured one person in the town of Velyka Pysarivka. Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine&apos;s northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region&apos;s vulnerable border settlements experiencing multiple attacks per day. Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months, amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months. A Russian missile strike on a residential building in Sumy on Nov. 17 killed 11 people and injured another 89. A source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff said on Nov. 23 that nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast in an attempt to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there &#x2014; as Ukraine looked to do with its surprise incursion into neighboring Kursk Oblast in August. Russia continues its onslaught of drone and missile attacks ahead of an expected harsh winter amid Russia strike on energy infrastructure. Overnight on Nov. 25, Russia launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine, with Ukrainian air defenses reportedly being able to down 76 drones across 17 oblasts.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-residential-building-kindergarten-in-sumy-kills-2/	2024-11-26T17:55:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-2186977891-612x612.jpg
Biden shifts policies to strengthen Ukraine ahead of potential peace talks, WP reports	U.S. President Joe Biden has reversed key policies on providing advanced weapons to Ukraine, including longer-range missiles and antipersonnel land mines, as Kyiv faces mounting pressure on the battlefield and a potential need to negotiate with Russia. Many U.S. officials now acknowledge that Ukraine could be pushed into talks within months and might be forced to cede territory to end the war, the Washington Post (WP) reported on Nov. 26. In mid-November, Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, a decision aiming at strengthening Ukraine&#x2019;s negotiating position. His administration previously resisted supplying such weapons over concerns of escalating tensions with Russia. The changes come amid significant challenges for Ukraine, including battlefield losses, reports of North Korea sending troops to support Russia, and Donald Trump taking office in January. Trump has vowed to end the war within 24 hours, but officials worry his administration would cut off aid to Ukraine, undermining its ability to resist Russian aggression. Biden&#x2019;s aides argue that evolving conditions on the ground have driven his decisions to provide weapons, but critics, including former U.S. ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker, say the delays emboldened Moscow. &quot;It gives Russia a sense of impunity,&quot; Volker told the WP, adding that earlier support could have bolstered Ukraine&#x2019;s position. &quot;They know they have a sanctuary. They know we don&#x2019;t want to escalate, and they can go ahead and carry out the war, conduct strikes and do outrageous things.&quot; European allies, while welcoming the recent weapons transfers, have expressed frustration that the assistance did not come earlier when Ukraine&#x2019;s position was stronger. Many now believe that peace talks may involve territorial concessions, and discussions have begun on potential security guarantees for Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression, according to the WP. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged NATO allies to increase support for Ukraine ahead of Trump&#x2019;s return to office, emphasizing the need to reinforce Kyiv before the U.S. political landscape shifts further. &quot;We will continue to shore up everything we&#x2019;re doing for Ukraine to ensure it can effectively defend itself,&quot; Blinken said during his one-day emergency visit to Brussels on Nov. 13.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-shifts-policies-to-strengthen-ukraine-ahead-of-potential-peace-talks-wp-reports/	2024-11-26T16:39:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1903200714.jpg
Gazprom plans for end of gas transit via Ukraine after 2024, Reuters reports	Gazprom, Russia&#x2019;s state-controlled gas company, is planning for a scenario in which no natural gas will flow to Europe through Ukraine after Dec. 31, 2024, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters. Kyiv has indicated it will not extend the transit deal, ending over 50 years of gas flows from Siberia to central Europe &#x2014; a vital revenue stream for Russia since the Soviet era. Ukraine earns up to $1 billion annually in transit fees but has said it does not intend to renew the agreement. Moscow, however, has expressed willingness to continue using the Ukrainian route. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow remains ready to pump gas through Ukraine. Despite these signals, Gazprom&#x2019;s internal planning assumes no Ukrainian transit next year, the source said, adding that the company expects Russian gas exports to Europe and Turkey&#x2014;termed &quot;far abroad&quot;&#x2014;to decline by 20% in 2025. Due to the loss of the Ukrainian route, exports are projected to drop to just under 39 billion cubic meters (bcm) from the more than 49 bcm expected this year. The expected drop excludes gas supplies to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, which is forecast to reach 38 bcm in 2025. Turkish supplies via the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines are not expected to decline. Russia&#x2019;s gas exports to Europe via Ukraine have already fallen significantly, with only 15 bcm delivered through this route in 2023. That figure represents just 8% of peak Russian gas flows to Europe in 2018-2019. The Soviet-era Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline transported about 14.65 bcm of gas through the Sudzha entry point in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region to Slovakia in 2023, accounting for roughly half of Russia&#x2019;s remaining European gas exports. The war in Ukraine and the 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany have severely disrupted the energy link between Russia and Europe. EU gas consumption fell to 295 bcm in 2023, with Europe increasingly reliant on U.S. liquefied natural gas supplies to meet demand.	https://kyivindependent.com/gazprom-plans-for-end-of-gas-transit-via-ukraine-after-2024-reuters-reports/	2024-11-26T14:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-467548811.jpg
US Air Force notes drone activity over military bases in UK, Reuters reports	Unidentified drones have flown over three U.S. Air Force bases in the U.K. in the past week, U.S. officials said on Nov. 26. &quot;Small unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of and over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell from Nov. 20 to Nov. 26,&quot; a spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters. The three bases, located in Suffolk and Norfolk, are leased by the U.S. Air Force from the U.K. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder addressed the incidents, emphasizing the U.S. military&#x2019;s serious approach to the situation. &quot;Installation leaders have determined so far that none of these incursions impact the base residents, the facilities, or the assets that we have on those bases,&quot; Ryder said. While noting that small drones are a common occurrence, he stressed it remains too early to determine whether the flights originated from hobbyists or another source. A U.S. official, speaking anonymously, indicated the drone activity appeared coordinated rather than the work of casual enthusiasts. The official added that investigations into the incidents are ongoing. The U.K.&apos;s Ministry of Defense acknowledged the reports and expressed its commitment to security at defense installations.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-air-force-notes-drone-activity-over-military-bases-in-uk-reuters-reports/	2024-11-26T13:56:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/justice.jpeg
Ukraine war latest: Russia launches record 188 drones against Ukraine overnight, Air Force says	Key developments on Nov. 26: Russia launched a record number of 188 Shaheds and other drones against Ukraine in a single night on Nov. 26, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 76 drones across 17 oblasts, while 95 were &quot;lost,&quot; presumably thanks to electronic warfare means. Five drones flew to Belarus, according to the Air Force. Russia has deployed cheap kamikaze drones, including Iranian-made Shaheds, against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure since the first year of the full-scale war. Moscow has intensified the drone attacks in recent months, with air raid alerts sounding daily in major cities like Kyiv. &quot;During the overnight attack, Russia launched a record number of Shahed-type attack drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles of an unknown type from the directions of Orel, Bryans, Kursk, and Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Russia,&quot; the Air Force&apos;s statement read. Moscow launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine in October, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry admitted on Nov. 26 that Ukraine had targeted Russian S-400 air defense systems and an airfield in embattled Kursk Oblast with U.S.-made long-range ATACMS missiles over the past three days. The statement is the first public confirmation of the attacks by Russia, following multiple reports of strikes after Washington permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to the ministry, Ukrainian forces launched five ATACMS missiles on Nov. 23 near the village of Lotarevka, some 37 km northwest of Kursk, with three of them shot down. The other two missiles hit the positions of an S-400 surface-to-air missile division. &quot;The strike damaged a radar. There are casualties among the personnel,&quot; the Defense Ministry said. Previously, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also claimed that Ukraine had struck a Russian S-400 radar in Kursk Oblast. Ukraine also fired eight ATACMS missiles on Nov. 25 at the Kursk Vostochny airbase in the town of Khalino in Kursk Oblast, seven of which were allegedly shot down by Russian air defenses, the Russian ministry claimed. One of the missiles &quot;reached its target,&quot; injuring two soldiers and damaging infrastructure, the ministry said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. While OSINT analysts earlier reported the strike against the Russian airbase, the Ukrainian military has not commented on the attack. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry threatened with &quot;retaliatory actions&quot; to Ukraine&apos;s strikes. The advance of Russian forces in Ukraine continues to gain pace, reaching a new weekly and monthly record, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on Nov. 25, citing its analysis of the DeepState monitoring group&apos;s data. Russia has captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in the past week, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the analysis. Russian forces have taken 600 square kilometers (232 square miles) since the start of November, which is more than in the entire October, setting a new record since early 2022, Agentstvo wrote. The advance is reportedly the fastest near Velyka Novosilka, a village in southern Donetsk Oblast close to the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Ukrainian officials have increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. According to Agentstvo&apos;s analysis of DeepState data, Russia captured around 187 square kilometers (72 square miles) in the south. Moscow&apos;s troops have also reportedly advanced 33 square kilometers (12.7 square miles) near Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in Donetsk Oblast, 10 square kilometers (3.8 square miles) in the east of Kharkiv Oblast, and 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) near Chasiv Yar. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Russian forces apparently shot five unarmed Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in Donetsk Oblast earlier this November, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 26, launching a war crime investigation. According to the statement, Russian troops captured five Ukrainian defenders during an assault in the Pokrovsk sector. After forcing them to lay down their weapons and lie down on the ground, they are said to have shot them with automatic weapons. &quot;An investigation is currently underway to establish all the circumstances of the crime and the persons involved,&quot; the prosecutors&apos; statement read. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said he had notified the United Nations and the Red Cross regarding the latest case from the Pokrovsk sector. &quot;I emphasize that the killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is qualified as a serious international crime,&quot; he wrote. The U.K. has delivered dozens of Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine, Bloomberg reports, marking the first major arms transfer under Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#x2019;s leadership. The unannounced shipments carried out weeks ago, were ordered after Ukrainian forces faced shortages of long-range missiles, according to sources familiar with the matter. Officials speaking to Bloomberg, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information, confirmed that the missiles were supplied before the U.K. and the U.S. authorized Ukraine to target locations inside Russia with long-range weapons. The exact timeline and quantity of the shipment remain undisclosed. &quot;We do not comment on operational detail, to do so would only benefit [Russian President Vladimir Putin],&quot; the Ministry of Defense told Bloomberg. The ministry reiterated the U.K.&#x2019;s &quot;ironclad&quot; support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukrainian forces recently used the Storm Shadow missiles to strike Russian targets in the western Bryansk region, one day after deploying U.S.-made ATACMS in similar operations.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-44/	2024-11-26T12:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183433232.jpg
Once liberated Kupiansk braces for worst as Russian troops approach, and future Western support looks uncertain	KUPIANSK &#x2014; Volodymyr paused his Sunday stroll from a shopping center in Kupiansk to take pictures of rubble from a Russian strike that almost killed his wife late last month. &quot;It was broad daylight when they struck,&quot; he said. &quot;Our only luck was that my wife was in the kitchen, so the flying glass did not hit her,&quot; Volodymyr said, who lives with his wife only a few meters from the epicenter of the explosion. Fearing a return of Russian occupation to his increasingly bombed-out front-line city in Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, Volodymyr refused to provide his full name. The 1.5-ton thermobaric bomb that Russian troops dropped next to the shopping center at the edge of the city killed a 73-year-old woman and injured others. The use of such destructive weapons against civilians marks the Russian army&apos;s upscaled push to occupy the latest Ukrainian city, enduring more suffering and uncertain prospects. One recent Russian strike on Kupiansk disrupted central water supplies throughout the city, forcing the people left in the city, most of them retirees, to roam streets carrying buckets from wells to their homes. &quot;There has been no water for two days now, and we&apos;re afraid that soon there will be no electricity and (natural) gas,&quot; said Ivana in early November, a retiree who glanced into the sky nervously, fearing the possibility of Russian drone strikes from above. &quot;We feel abandoned,&quot; she added as Russia&apos;s army sped up a grinding advance towards Kupiansk.

(Fermin Torrano/Anadolu via Getty Images)Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and approached the city&apos;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Earlier in November, Ukrainian forces successfully repelled Russian attempts to break into the city. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState also reported on Nov. 26 that Ukrainian forces had completed clearing Kupiansk of Russian soldiers. The pressure on the city remains, with Russian troops geared up to try again in the near future. Divided by the Oskil River, Kupiansk lies at a critical junction between the Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast and the adjacent Kharkiv Oblast, which Ukraine largely liberated during a surprise counteroffensive in autumn 2022. Now, with Russia&apos;s increasing offensives across the entire front and the U.S. support for Ukraine in the long run remaining uncertain, residents of Kupiansk are expecting the worst to come. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump had promised to end Russia&apos;s war swiftly, without providing a clear scenario on how he plans to achieve such a result. The president-elect&apos;s inner circle has also been vocal, floating the idea of freezing the war along the current front lines leaving cities like Kupiansk and the residents that remain on the edge or in Russia grip indefinitely. Russia has a poor record of keeping to ceasefire agreements that predate its full-blown invasion of Ukraine by almost a decade. &quot;We already went through this during the first and second Minsk agreements, through various truces, freezes, but in all cases, Russia always violated these agreements,&quot; Serhiy Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, told the Kyiv Independent. His comments refer to two ceasefire agreements, one in 2014 and another in 2015 brokered by the West, that froze front lines in Ukraine&apos;s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts after Russia occupied part of those regions. A number of towns and villages were left on the front lines, experiencing occasional shelling, lack of basic necessities, and lacking the ability to escape the years-long war. A visit to Kupiansk today largely mirrors the devastation brought to the towns left on the front lines. Kupiansk is an increasingly abandoned city. Despite a mandatory evacuation order for all citizens announced in mid-October, locals estimate several thousand residents remain despite the mounting risks. The city is experiencing the third siege in three years after it was briefly occupied by Russian forces in 2022, then liberated during the successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the autumn of the same year. Back then, the Ukrainian army&apos;s surprise counterattack pushed the Russian troops to about a dozen kilometers from the city&apos;s outskirts. Two years after the retreat, Russia&apos;s army has doubled its efforts to recapture it. Since early September, they have advanced several kilometers, approaching the city&apos;s eastern outskirts. Earlier this month, Ukraine&apos;s army said it was repelling enemy attempts to enter the city. Kuzan, a native of Kharkiv Oblast, said Ukraine&apos;s army is in a good position to hold the city&apos;s eastern outskirts against Russian incursions &quot;provided that there is a sufficient amount of ammunition and materiel.&quot; However, that remains in doubt as President-elect Trump vows to end the war quickly, pulling the plug on future military aid to Ukraine. One of the possible scenarios to follow up on Trump&apos;s promise is reducing military aid to Ukraine, forcing the country into giving up territory for peace. Yet Trump, who has in the past expressed a fancy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, has also said he could boost Ukrainian weapons supplies to pressure Russia into a peace agreement. &quot;I believe that what he (Trump) has said about the tools is what he intends to do,&quot; former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst told the Kyiv Independent. People from Kupiansk arrive at an evacuation point as mandatory evacuation from four communities in the Kharkiv Oblast kicks off due to hostilities in the region on Oct. 17, 2024. (Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)&quot;It&apos;s not clear (how Trump would achieve peace). I do think that there is going to be some form of cut in aid. It may also be that American military assistance will move from a straight aid program to a loan program,&quot; said Herbst, now serving as senior director of the Washington, D.C.-based Atlantic Council&apos;s Eurasia Center. The former ambassador is skeptical about a lasting agreement between Ukraine and Russia should the front line be frozen. &quot;It would not surprise me if Putin were to agree to negotiate along those lines, maybe even reach an agreement. And then, of course, work immediately to undermine that agreement and continue his aggression against Ukraine,&quot; Herbst added. In Kupiansk, the last bridge connecting the two sides of the Oskil River remained open to civilian traffic in late October. &quot;The Russians are striking the industrial complex on the left not only with glide bombs and FPV drones now, but with artillery and tanks too,&quot; a soldier on the ground with the military, call sign Riaba, told the Kyiv Independent. He spoke amid the relentless sound of various calibers crackling and booming in the background without revealing his real name due to security concerns. &quot;The Russians are attempting to break into the (eastern) part of the city in small units, but so far we repelled them,&quot; he said. &quot;They need it because of the railway, if they take it, we&apos;ll be in a very, very bad position.&quot; Kuzan estimates that Kupiansk holds value to the Russian army due to its highways and railway lines. If captured, it could serve as a springboard for continued north-to-south offensive operations into the heart of the last remaining densely populated urban areas of Donetsk Oblast still held by Ukraine &#x2014; the cities and agglomerations of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. &quot;The city is a large railway hub, and the Russian army&apos;s logistics is built around railway transportation, not road,&quot; Kuzan said. Although the Russian military has not yet been able to get a foothold, the city remains under indiscriminate bombardment. &quot;The Russians are on the attack, they are not trying to freeze the front line,&quot; Kuzan added. If Russian forces capture Kupiansk before a ceasefire, they will be in pole position to retake all eastern bank territory south of the city along the Oskil River stretching south to the Donetsk Oblast front lines. In the unlikely event of a frozen front line, Kuzan sees little chance for Kupiansk to live in peace due to the constant threat of Russian attacks after a ceasefire. &quot;Both for Kupiansk and our other cities to be able to live and function, it is necessary, first of all, to quickly reduce the strike capabilities of the Russian army,&quot; said Kuzan. A view of the enterence to Kupiansk, Ukraine on Oct. 16, 2024. (Fermin Torrano/Anadolu via Getty Images)His comments echo President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s repeated calls for allies to boost firepower supplies, including the provision of more long-range missiles capable of hindering Russian logistics. &quot;Only in this case can we talk about some kind of stabilization in these cities, having removed their instrument for terror,&quot; Kuzan said. Back in Kupiansk, the scene in early November was nerve-racking. &quot;We trust God will help us,&quot; said Svitlana, a resident selling military chevrons in the middle of the city, despite the sound of small arms fire in the background. Some people motivated to help feed Ukrainian soldiers protecting the city remained reluctant to evacuate. &quot;Other than the fact that we were born here, who would sell these boys (the soldiers) hotdogs if we fled?&quot; asked Viktoria, a shopkeeper at the bombed-out shopping center that nearly killed Volodymyr&apos;s wife. As her colleague repaired a damaged roof, Viktoria served customers. &quot;We remained open that day and will be open for the guys (Ukrainian soldiers) in the future,&quot; she added.

Norway may increase aid to Ukraine to $2.7 billion in 2025	Oslo may increase its support for Ukraine to 30 billion kroner ($2.7 billion) in 2025, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Nov. 26, NRK public broadcaster reported. Norway has allocated 27 billion kroner ($2.4 billion) to support Ukraine this year, but in the draft state budget for 2025, the funding was reduced to 15 billion kroner ($1.3 billion). After the Norwegian government met with leaders of the country&apos;s parliament earlier in the day, Store said there is a proposal to double funding to at least 30 billion. The final decision is expected to be made on Nov. 28. Norway is ranked 12th in the world in terms of the amount of aid provided to Ukraine, having so far provided $2.8 billion in humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute&apos;s Ukraine Support Tracker. In late October, Store said that Oslo would provide Kyiv with a new 500-million-euro ($543 million) aid package, with over half allocated for military assistance.	https://kyivindependent.com/norway-may-increase-aid-to-ukraine-to-2-7-billion-in-2025/	2024-11-26T12:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1636214818.jpg
Honestly, go f**k yourself' — Ukrainians react to Joe Rogan’s rant on Ukraine	Joe Rogan, one of the world&apos;s most popular podcasters, has sparked outrage in Ukraine, after claiming that Kyiv and its Western allies, rather than Russia, &quot;are about to start World War III.&quot; In an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience last Friday, the U.S. host criticized the outgoing President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration for allowing Ukraine to strike with Storm Shadow and ATACMS long-range missiles deep into Russian territory. In response to their use, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a &quot;test&quot; of a nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile, carried out in a strike on the city of Dnipro, central Ukraine on Nov. 21. Despite the long-running nuclear rhetoric emanating from the Kremlin, and the fact Moscow launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the first place, Rogan pinned all the blame for the escalation of international tensions on Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky. &quot;How are you allowed to (authorize strikes inside Russia) when you are on your way out? Like, people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore,&quot; Rogan said. &#x201C;There should be some sort of pause for significant actions that could potentially start World War III.&#x201D; &quot;Zelensky says Putin is terrified. F**k you, man. You f**king people are about to start World War III,&quot; Rogan said, adding that negotiations with Moscow should be the path Kyiv pursues over military action. Rogan also repeated unfounded stories that Zelensky uses drugs. &quot;This is cocaine-like behavior. &#x2018;Putin&#x2019;s f**king &#xA0;scared, man, Putin&#x2019;s terrified. We got him. We got him, man, we got him.&#x2019; &quot;Like, what are you talking about? He has nuclear missiles. You f**king monkeys,&quot; Rogan said. Prominent Ukrainians including former professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko, and former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba have publicly condemned Rogan&apos;s statements. On Nov. 26, the Kyiv Independent went out on the streets of Kyiv to see what people thought about them. Natalia Romanets, purchasing manager in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)Let him come to Kyiv, let him come to Ukraine, see everything with his own eyes, and then make some conclusions. Because it&apos;s hard to assess the situation from so many thousands of kilometers away. I think he just doesn&apos;t feel or understand what is happening in the world. It&apos;s strange. I thought Americans were polite, well-mannered people but what he is saying about us is simply offensive. If he were attacked somewhere in America, at a gas station, for example, and they put a knife to his throat, how would he negotiate? Maybe he knows some formula or scenarios for negotiating in such circumstances with a knife pressing on an artery. It&#x2019;s hard to talk when you&apos;re being killed. Albina Volobuueva, sales worker in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)(Rogan) does not live in Ukraine, so he cannot comment on it. He has nothing to do with us. This war already feels like World War III to me &#x2014; many countries are already involved, they help us in various ways, and they also suffer because of it. So, to me, World War III has already begun &#x2014; and has been going for quite some time now. I would be glad if this were over because I can&apos;t handle the constant deaths, explosions, people being taken away, and men going to war anymore. Life in the country is really tense right now. But if there were negotiations, they should be for the benefit of our country and our people. This person&apos;s words are very strange and incorrect. Yelyzaveta Kovalenko, social media manager in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)We are now simply hostages of Russia, which has come to our land. We didn&apos;t call them, we didn&apos;t start this war, and we didn&apos;t want it. We were living peaceful lives in Ukraine, and they just invaded us. We have nothing else left to defend ourselves with. Putin will never be satisfied. Therefore, negotiations should only end with the recognition that we are a sovereign entity that no one else should touch. (Rogan) has never been in a state of war for three years, like our president. Considering how tired he already is, how he has no strength left, one could think all kinds of things about him. But our president still addresses the Ukrainian people daily and supports us by doing that. I would say this podcaster transfers the responsibility of the Russians onto us. But that&#x2019;s not right. We did not start the war. The responsibility is absolutely on them (Russians) for the possible start of World War III. We are being killed, and we have nothing left to do, only fight. Who even said that Russia wants negotiations? Oksana Hres, sales worker in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)Stop Putin, and then there will be no World War III. Tell the mothers, children, and wives of tortured people about negotiations, about how you can somehow reach an agreement when you can&apos;t return the children who were tortured to death. As for his last words about World War III, I think he should remember the words of (Ukraine&apos;s former Commander-in-Chief Valerii) Zaluzhnyi about the fact that World War III has already begun, and so it makes sense to figure out what side he wants to be on. To start negotiations, both sides need to want to do it. Unfortunately, no one is willing to make concessions right now. Olha Serova, fashion industry manager in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)If I were to comment on this situation, I&apos;d probably say &#x201C;f*ck you.&#x201D; What else can I say? I think that advising to enter negotiations means he&apos;s only superficially observing the situation. Because if a person delves deeper into it, he will understand that negotiating with (Putin) is impossible. The fact that Russia launches a bunch of missiles at Ukraine &#x2013; is that normal? Should we feel safe? We did not start this war. And in fact, the greater responsibility lies with Russia, with Putin, for starting World War III. Mykola Korotkyi, video producer in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 26, 2024. (The Kyiv Independent)Honestly, go f**k yourself. Come here, live here, and truly understand what&#x2019;s happening instead of making assumptions with your headlines. We would then look at you as if you were actually experiencing what&#x2019;s happening in Ukraine every night. I&apos;m not just talking about Kyiv, but places where glide bombs and other (weapons) are dropped. That&apos;s why someone like you, such a d*ckhead, shouldn&#x2019;t open your mouth. If the U.S. had fulfilled their international agreements on time, supported Ukraine, and taken a proper stance on what was happening, there would be no World War III.	https://kyivindependent.com/honestly-go-f-k-yourself-ukrainians-react-to-joe-rogans-rant-on-ukraine/	2024-11-26T12:28:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1390671342.jpg
Ukrainian MP from Zelensky's party nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize	Oleksandr Merezhko, a top MP from President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s party, has nominated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, according to his letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee seen by the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 26. Merezhko&apos;s move is at odds with the statements of many opinion leaders in Ukraine who have criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioning further U.S. assistance to Ukraine. Trump has also promised to broker a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, and there is speculation that he could pressure Kyiv to cede territory to Russia or agree to Putin&apos;s terms. However, some Ukrainian politicians and analysts argue that Trump may be swayed to Ukraine&apos;s side and help Kyiv reach a peace deal with Russia from a position of strength. &quot;It is my belief that Trump has made considerable contributions to world peace, and that he can make more in the future,&quot; Merezhko, an MP from Zelensky&apos;s Servant of the People party and chairman of the Ukrainian parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee, wrote in his letter. The lawmaker mentioned Trump&apos;s mediation of agreements between Israel and Muslim countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan, during his first presidential term. &quot;Trump also laid the foundations for today&apos;s international coalition of support for Ukraine by demonstrating global leadership in supplying weapons to resist Russia&apos;s brutal and illegal war of aggression,&quot; Merezhko said in an apparent reference to Trump&apos;s decision to supply Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles during his first term. When asked by the Kyiv Independent about his motivation for the nomination, the lawmaker said he wants to use it &quot;as an opportunity to attract Trump&apos;s attention so that he could help Ukraine to survive.&quot; Merezhko expressed hope that &quot;in his attempts to stop Russia&apos;s aggression against Ukraine (Trump) will be searching for a solution on the basis of international law, including such principles as territorial integrity, respect for the sovereignty of Ukraine, and non-use of force.&quot; Merezhko said in his nomination letter that Trump could help Ukraine achieve &quot;just, comprehensive and sustainable peace based on the UN Charter and principles of international law.&quot; On the campaign trail, Trump promised to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine if elected, saying in September that he would negotiate a deal &quot;that&apos;s good for both sides.&quot; Trump&apos;s election has intensified uncertainty around Ukraine&apos;s war effort at a critical time, as Russian forces make their fastest gains in months and North Korean troops are stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-mp-proposes-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize/	2024-11-26T11:56:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183887240.jpg
Ukraine pushes back Russian troops from Kupiansk, military says	Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian troops from Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast and maintain control over the situation on the town&#x2019;s outskirts, Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Khortytsia group of forces, said on Nov. 26. Russian troops ramped up their efforts near Kupiansk in early September and approached the city&#x2019;s industrial outskirts in the northeast. Earlier in November, Ukrainian forces successfully repelled Russian attempts to break into the city. The crowd-sourced monitoring website DeepState also reported on Nov. 26 that Ukrainian forces had completed clearing Kupiansk of Russian soldiers. Speaking on national television, Voloshyn said that Russia uses small groups in an attempt to cross to the right bank of the Oskil River. &quot;Even if groups of eight to ten people manage to cross, only two or three from each group reach the (right) bank. The enemy has been eliminated there as well,&quot; he said. &quot;Everything there (in Kupiansk) is under the control of our Defense Forces.&quot; The estimated advance of Russian forces in Kharkiv Oblast as of Nov. 25, 2024, according to DeepState. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)Kupiansk is a key logistics and railway hub in the eastern part of Kharkiv Oblast. With several highways and five railway lines running through it, the town was briefly occupied by Russian forces before it was liberated during a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the autumn of 2022. Capturing the city would widen the north-to-south supply route from Russia&#x2019;s Belgorod Oblast, fuelling their attempt to take the entire Donbas region.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-push-back-russian-troops-from-kupiansk-military-says/	2024-11-26T10:19:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178114402-1.jpg
Ukraine Reforms Tracker Weekly — Issue 2	Editor&#x2019;s note: This is issue 2 of Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&#x2019;s weekly &quot;Ukraine Reforms Tracker&quot; covering events from Nov. 18-24, 2024. This newsletter was until recently titled &#x201C;Ukrainian Economy in Brief.&quot; The digest highlights steps taken in the Ukrainian parliament related to business, economics, and international financial programs. The Kyiv Independent is republishing with permission. Parliament adopts the 2025 state budget. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament, on Nov. 19 adopted next year&#x2019;s state budget in its final reading. The government expects budget revenues to reach Hr 2.3 trillion (around $55 billion) the following year. This includes an estimated Hr 141 billion ($3.4 billion) in additional revenue from tax hikes. However, President Volodymyr Zelensky has yet to sign the draft law with relevant amendments to the Tax Code. Budget expenditures are projected to reach a record Hr 3.94 trillion ($95 billion), with Hr 2.22 trillion ($53 billion) allocated to defense spending. Government approves two draft laws to meet IMF structural benchmarks. On Nov. 22, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a draft law to establish a High Specialized Administrative Court with judges selected based on professional competence and integrity, by a selection commission with a decisive vote of experts with international experience. The deadline to meet this obligation is set for Dec. 31. The government has already submitted its draft law (#12206-1) to the Verkhovna Rada as legislation on the same topic was submitted by Andrii Motovylovets, the deputy chair of parliament&#x2019;s Sluha Narodu (Servant of the People) faction. The move of Motovylovets triggered a 14-day countdown for registering alternative draft laws, which will end on Nov. 28. Additionally, the Cabinet of Ministers approved amendments to the Budget Code to incorporate public investment management (PIM) into the budgeting process as outlined in the June 2024 PIM Action Plan. This proposed legislation has not yet been submitted to parliament. This structural benchmark has to be met by the &#xA0;end of January 2025. Verkhovna Rada unblocks reform of Accounting Chamber. Following the adoption of draft law #10044-d on the reform of the Accounting Chamber (ACU), Ukraine&apos;s main auditing body, lawmakers submitted seven resolutions aimed at overturning the decision. They were all rejected last week, paving the way for the parliament chairman and the president to sign the bill into law. The law will establish a transparent, competitive process for selecting the ACU&#x2019;s members, with international experts having a decisive vote of approval. This will ensure the political and financial independence of the state body. Verkhovna Rada votes for draft law to meet an obligation under Ukraine Plan. Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament adopted in the first of two readings draft law #12131 on resuming monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the first quarter 2025. The Ukraine Plan sets a deadline for this measure in the second quarter of 2025. Illegal tobacco trade on the rise, according to Parliamentary Temporary Investigative Commission on Economic Security. After a period of rising, legal sales of tobacco products have begun to drop again since September 2024. Legal sales decreased to Hr 10.8 billion($260 million) in October 2024 from Hr 11.4 billion ($275 million) in August. The Parliamentary Temporary Investigative Commission on Economic Security warns that this may signal the resurgence of illegal tobacco production, with manufacturers continuing their operations despite previous searches and arrests by the Bureau of Economic Security.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-reforms-tracker-weekly-issue-2/	2024-11-26T10:13:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Despite popular uprising, Kremlin's grip on occupied Abkhazia runs supreme	When local council members gathered in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia last week to discuss new measures promoting Russian investment, a group of protestors rose to meet them. The proposed legislation, which would have legalized Russian investment and land ownership in the occupied region, had already sparked unrest. On Nov. 19, protesters blocked bridges around the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi. By Nov. 22, the crowd had descended on Abkhazia&apos;s parliament building. Protesters smashed through the gates with a truck and stormed the compound as police officers fired tear gas. At least 14 people were injured. The region&apos;s de facto president, Aslan Bzhania, resigned days later. The investment bill was shelved. This episode of seeming defiance may have sparked unease in the Kremlin. Moscow has been funding the Abkhazian government since the Russo-Georgian war in 2008, when it rolled troops into the region and declared Abkhazia and the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia to be independent states. Aslan Bzhania, the leader of Russian-occupied Georgian breakaway region of Abkhazia, in Moscow on June 24, 2020. (Alexey Nikolsky / Pool / AFP via Getty Images)But the political situation is far from clear cut. The same demonstrators protesting against pro-Russia legislation were also those that hoisted the Russian tricolor as they stormed Abkhazian government buildings. The pro-Russian protesters effectively ousting a pro-Russian president in protest of the adoption of a Russian-friendly piece of legislation shows how the Kremlin can endure political turmoil in the region. Many of Russia&apos;s goals in Abkhazia are firmly geopolitical. Although small &#x2014; slightly over 8,600 square kilometers &#x2014; a Russian-controlled Abkhazia can be used to reinforce Moscow&apos;s influence in the South Caucasus and to pressure Russia&apos;s southern neighbor, Georgia. Russian troops are deployed in the region, which acts as a key transport corridor between the North and South Caucasus., Iits position on the Black Sea is already being used by Moscow to build a permanent Russian naval base. For most Abkhazians, meanwhile, Moscow&apos;s presence in the area has a far more tangible day-to-day impact. Russia supports the region financially, provides Abkhazians with passports to travel abroad, and provides quotas for Abkhazian students to study at Russian universities. All of this creates broad, pro-Russian public support. &quot;Abkhazians see Russia as a guarantor of their independence,&quot; says Dr Piotr Sieniawski, an assistant professor at the Cardinal Stefan Wyszy&#x144;ski University in Warsaw. &quot;Abkhazia is very much dependent on Russia: somewhere between 50 and 60% of the region&apos;s budget is made up of direct subsidies from Moscow. Without Russia, it would be very difficult for Abkhazia to survive (as a breakaway state).&quot; Such support comes with demands &#x2014; a fact of which Abkhazia&apos;s elites are particularly aware, says Sieniawski. But far more than being pro-Russian, local communities are pro-Abkhazian. They are aware of their own interests &#x2013; and tensions are quick to rise if Russia&apos;s demands are seen to collide with Abkhaz needs. That includes any law that would allow Russians to buy tracts of land along Abkhazia&apos;s tourist-friendly Black Sea coast, says Olesya Vartanyan, a conflict analyst specializing in security, peace processes, and foreign policy in the South Caucasus. Currently, only Abkhazians are allowed to own land in the breakaway region.

Bush denounced Russian recognition of Georgia&apos;s regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, warning Moscow it must &quot;reconsider this irresponsible decision.&quot; (STR/AFP via Getty Images)&quot;The protests aren&apos;t about, &apos;we want Russia out.&apos; It&apos;s more about, &apos;we want to protect our own interests,&apos;&quot; Vartanyan says. &quot;They are very much afraid that if Russian companies start purchasing property, then there will be very little space left for local people. The phrase that is usually used is: &apos;We will become servants to the Russians, rather than their hosts.&apos;&quot; In many cases, such fears could be easily pushed aside by politicians, who may be inclined to wave through Russian-friendly legislation and benefit financially from a more developed tourism economy. But Abkhazia&apos;s unique history and geographical position makemakes it difficult for officials to simply discard public opinion. Its small population means that ordinary people are not only more likely to have access to politicians, but they are also very likely to have worked alongside them, attended school with them, or even be related to them. In a province of just 244,000 people where informal connections often outweigh official communication channels, there is little escape from an angry populace. &quot;Everybody knows everyone in Abkhazia. If an ordinary person meets an Abkhazian politician somewhere in Sukhumi, they feel they have the right to express their opinions openly &#x2014; and that the politician should be listening,&quot; says Sieniawski. Another well-used Russian anti-protest tactic &#x2014; simple police violence &#x2014; is unlikely to quell demonstrations in the region. Most local families did not surrender their weapons after the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict of the 1990s, when Abkhazia declared itself an independent state for the first time. This easy access to arms means that state violence could easily cascade into a more serious conflict. &quot;It is really very difficult to imagine that local leaders could hire some external group of bodyguards to enter the presidential administration and throw out protesters by force. That would definitely have led to further bloodshed,&quot; says Vartanyan. &quot;Each local family has access to weaponry &#x2014; and everyone knows it. It is a threat that can be activated the moment someone feels that their rights are violated. It&apos;s like a nuclear weapon nobody wants to use,&quot; she adds. Until recently, Abkhazia&apos;s de-facto leadership had found a simple answer to uncomfortable Russian demands: endless delays and procrastination. The Russian businesses, many of whom are taking an increasing interest in places like Abkhazia as sanctions bar them from investing elsewhere, have been vocal in their dissatisfaction. &quot;Previously, Russian companies wouldn&apos;t want to invest in (occupied territories like) Abkhazia so as not to spoil their relations with Western partners,&quot; says Vartanyan. &quot;After being sanctioned, that doesn&apos;t matter anymore.&quot; Yet, while this foot-dragging is irksome, it is not necessarily worrying for Moscow. With the Kremlin&apos;s ultimate trump card in hand &#x2014; Russia&apos;s control of the occupied region&apos;s political survivability &#x2014; it is unlikely that officials in Sukhumi can outrun Moscow&apos;s demands indefinitely. &quot;If Russia is financing Abkhazia, they will be asking for something in return. Now, maybe this particular investment bill was not so high on Russia&apos;s political agenda, but these demands will be back again sooner or later,&quot; says Sieniawski. &quot;I think this dynamic of attempted resistance will remain, but the question is to what extent they can resist.&quot; A once opulent Soviet era train station sits in ruins in the contested region of Sukhumi, Abkhazia.

(Daro Sulakauri/Getty Images)Even the prospect of power change and early elections in Abkhazia does not change this power balance &#x2014; nor the larger geopolitical picture that matters so much to the Kremlin. While the protesters who stormed the Abkhazian parliament may not have wanted to welcome Russian neighbors, they also weren&apos;t pushing to change the status quo&#x2014;for example, for the rapprochement with Georgia, which lost control of the occupied territory after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Russian invasion years after. As long as the larger picture &#x2014; the balance of power, the wider geopolitical plans &#x2014; remains stable, Moscow can simply adjust the details of the deal with whoever becomes Sukhumi&apos;s next de facto leader. &quot;In real terms, for Russia, nothing changes. They are still a dominant player. They are still expected to pay local salaries,&quot; says Vartanyan. &quot;If other foreign countries were to start recognizing Abkhazia as an independent state, then that might concern the Kremlin because it would provide Sukhumi with more space to maneuver. But I don&apos;t see that happening.&quot; &quot;Moscow has nothing to worry about in Abkhazia.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/despite-popular-uprising-kremlins-grip-on-occupied-abkhazia-runs-supreme/	2024-11-26T09:56:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1371843319.jpg
Ukrainian energy giant says it's 'disappointed' by report on EBRD's refusal to fund it	Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, said on Nov. 26 that it was &quot;disappointed&quot; by a report that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would not provide funds to DTEK due to its ownership by oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. The statement is a response to an article published by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The newspaper reported on Nov. 24 that Odile Renaud-Basso, the president of the EBRD, had said the bank would not provide funds to DTEK due to its ownership by Akhmetov. The EBRD is one of Ukraine&apos;s largest institutional investors. DTEK said it is &quot;disappointed&quot; by these comments, describing them as &quot;inaccurate information about the company and its shareholder.&quot; &quot;The goal of freeing the economy from the influence of oligarchs is absolutely essential, and we have very firm ideas on this: it is part of the reforms that must be made for Ukraine to join the European Union. If we accepted compromises on this issue, we would harm the country&apos;s long-term prospects,&quot; Odile Renaud-Basso said. DETEK also said that it is working with Western partners to restore infrastructure destroyed by Russia and to integrate the country&apos;s energy system into the EU. In response, the EBRD said that Renaud-Basso did not mention Akhmetov&apos;s name in the interview and did not link &quot;compromises&quot; to harming Ukraine&apos;s chances of joining the EU. &quot;She stated that the bank is &apos;vigilant&apos; about the role of oligarchs in this context,&quot; the EBRD added. Akhmetov is Ukraine&apos;s wealthiest man, with vast holdings in mining and metallurgy. Formerly a lawmaker of the pro-Russian Party of Regions, the business tycoon has lost a large part of his assets during Russia&apos;s invasion. DTEK said that the company, which produces 12% of Ukraine&apos;s critical electricity, &quot;is not a monopoly under either Ukrainian or European legislation.&quot; &quot;Following the adoption of the anti-oligarch law, which has been agreed upon with the European Commission, the company&#x2019;s shareholder is categorically not an oligarch,&quot; DTEK added. DTEK also said that the company had invested $1.2 billion of its own funds to restore energy infrastructure and thanked the EU and the U.S. for a decision to allocate 107 million euros ($112 million) to the company. Earlier this year Russian attacks destroyed 90% of DTEK&apos;s generation capacity during an aerial campaign that aimed to knock out Ukraine&apos;s power grid. &quot;The company hopes that the EBRD will further contribute to the restoration of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy sector. DTEK is ready to work with the bank to secure peace and light in Ukraine,&quot; the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-energy-giant-responds-to-ebrd-over-company-funding-comments/	2024-11-26T08:42:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2147953019.jpg
Russian assets seized under REPO act face uncertain future under Trump	There are some $4-5 billion of frozen Russian assets in the U.S. and it will be up to President-elect Donald Trump to decide what to do with them when he takes office in January 2025.After Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Western nations froze around $300 billion of assets belonging to the Russian Central Bank. The EU harbors around $220 billion, with $192 billion frozen in Brussels-based company Euroclear, as well as $26 billion in private assets.The West has been divided about whether to confiscate the assets and hand them over to Ukraine. The G7 took a unified step in October by using the windfall profits to back $50 billion in Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration loans, of which the U.S. will provide $20 billion, to fund Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction, economic, and defense needs. The U.S. has so far led the charge after President Joe Biden signed the REPO Act in April. The bill green lit the confiscation of frozen Russian assets in the U.S. for Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. As part of the bill, the U.S. had to locate all Russian assets within its jurisdiction by August. Washington has so far not publicly released a report on the number of assets. US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrive to give a press conference at the Masseria San Domenico on the sidelines of the G7 Summit hosted by Italy in Apulia region in Savelletri on June 13, 2024. (Mandel Ngan / AFP via Getty Images)Trump has not directly commented on the frozen Russian assets and his unpredictability makes it hard to know which route he will take. Mobilizing the assets and making Russia pay fits in with his strong-man approach but he may also err on the side of caution for fear of foreign countries, like China and Saudi Arabia, pulling out their assets from the U.S. Trump&#x2019;s decision will also impact Europe. He could pressure a reluctant Brussels to pick up the slack and resolve the EU&#x2019;s bickering over the issue. If Trump doesn&#x2019;t confiscate U.S.-based assets or he cuts funding for Ukraine, Brussels may have to reevaluate its position on sending Kyiv the lump sum as the country&#x2019;s defense and reconstruction costs pile up.At least for now, it seems unlikely that Trump would unfreeze the assets and hand them back to Russia. While he has the legal power to suggest repealing or amending the REPO Act, the decision has to pass through Congress. Many Republicans support confiscation of the assets, including House Speaker Republican Congressman Mike Johnson.&#x201C;There&apos;s no automatic procedure for Trump to get rid of this whole thing entirely,&#x201D; Anna Vlasyuk, a legal research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) told the Kyiv Independent. The REPO Act states that the assets should go into a non-interest-bearing Ukrainian support fund to be used for humanitarian help and reconstruction, last estimated at $486 billion, under the administration of the Secretary of State. It also says that the decision to liquidate the assets needs to be multilateral across all partners. In other words, the U.S. won&apos;t do it unless the other G7 nations confirm they will follow suit. Brussels and London have been bogged down in a debate about what to do with the assets. Opponents have lobbied against transferring the funds to Ukraine, citing concerns that it could destabilize G7 currencies if other countries pull their assets out of the West for fear they could be targeted next.If Trump does confiscate the assets and the EU doesn&#x2019;t, then countries friendly with Russia could pull their assets from the U.S. and buy bonds in Europe instead, said Vlasyuk. If Trump opts for liquidation, there is an incentive for him to push the others to act as well so as not to destabilize the U.S. dollar. &#x201C;If Trump supports full confiscation, he could apply stronger pressure on the EU than Biden has been able to.&#x201D;The REPO Act has tried to mitigate fears from other countries by explicitly saying that the bill only covers Russian assets, as opposed to those of Russia-friendly countries, due to the unique circumstances of the invasion of Ukraine. It underlines that confiscation is legal as Russia has violated international law thus undermining its sovereign immunity. The G7 leaders during a summit in Apulia, Italy, on June 13, 2024. (German Chancellor Olaf Scholz/X)Vlasyuk says the risks presented by opponents of confiscation are blown out of proportion and that G7 currencies are too dominant to divest from. She pointed out that when the RCB ditched the U.S. dollar in 2021, it increased its Euro shares instead of solely relying on non-G7 currencies like the Yuan. &#x201C;The RCB would like to avoid currencies like dollars, euros, and pounds. But it can&apos;t afford it economically,&#x201D; she said. The EU, nonetheless, has remained cautious and agreed in March to only use the profits generated from Russian assets, approximately $3.2 billion. The G7&#x2019;s ERA loans are so far the most notable breakthrough and will be in Ukraine&#x2019;s hands by the end of the year. While President Volodymyr Zelensky supported the $50 billion loan, he has stressed that the G7 should still go ahead with the full confiscation. The REPO Act is broad in terms of what it covers, meaning Trump can go after the property, bank accounts, and securities belonging to Russian state-owned companies in the U.S. in addition to oligarch assets. Vlasyuk believes going after Russian state-owned companies will be an easier option for Trump than oligarch assets. In the U.S., legally proving that individuals are directly complicit in Russia&#x2019;s aggression is an &#x201C;uphill battle,&#x201D; she said. But while the bill obligates the president to locate the Russian assets it does not force confiscation. Trump could simply leave them immobilized without transferring the money to Ukraine if he thinks there is a risk to the U.S. dollar. Already, Trump has raised alarm bells in Europe by indicating he could cut U.S. aid for Ukraine. If he decides not to act, then a cash-strapped Europe may consider liquidating the assets without Washington to keep funding Ukraine, although this could result in Russia divesting from the Euro, said Vlasyuk. Trump has insinuated that he will push for negotiations with Russia to freeze the war, previously claiming he could end it &quot;in 24 hours.&quot; Halushka says there is a risk that he could use the assets as a bargaining chip.

(Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)&#x201C;This approach is weak: Russia has already accepted the loss of these funds, and freezing them hasn&#x2019;t pressured Moscow into stopping the war,&#x201D; she said. Instead, Kyiv needs to convince its partners that it will be more worthwhile liquidating the assets for its needs, she added. The REPO Act does not state that the assets can be used for defense purposes. But if Trump pushes the EU to confiscate the money, then Europe could set aside part of the funds to purchase weapons from the U.S., either with the windfall profits or investing the confiscated money. This will see the EU increase its support and satisfy Trump while boosting the American defense industry and creating jobs, said Halushka. Ukraine will receive much-needed weapons and rely less on the political turbulence of its partners. &#x201C;If these assets are confiscated and a significant portion is directed toward purchasing American weapons for Ukraine, it creates a win-win situation,&#x201D; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-assets-seized-under-repo-act-face-uncertain-future-under-trump/	2024-11-26T08:25:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185636867.jpg
Kuleba: Joe Rogan, let’s talk and set the record straight on Ukraine	Joe Rogan lashed out at Ukraine on his latest podcast, expressing strong criticism of the United States for lifting restrictions on Ukraine&#x2019;s use of U.S.-supplied weapons to target Russian territory and launching an expletive-laden rant accusing President Volodymyr Zelensky of pushing to &#x201C;start World War III.&#x201D; Love him or hate him, Rogan commands an enormous, loyal audience. His platform thrives on pushing boundaries, challenging conventional ideas, and creating viral moments. But while he paints himself as a fearless truth-teller, it&#x2019;s striking how one-sided the conversation becomes when he tackles something as complex as Ukraine. Denigrating Ukrainians without giving them a chance to respond isn&#x2019;t just unfair &#x2014; it&#x2019;s emblematic of a larger issue: the persistent tendency to discuss Ukraine without involving Ukrainians. For years, Ukraine has been at the heart of global debates about war, world politics, and resilience. In Rogan&#x2019;s corner, everyone seems to have an opinion about us, but few take the time to actually listen to Ukrainians. On platforms like Rogan&#x2019;s &#x2014; where opinions flow freely and bold claims are the currency &#x2014; our voices are conspicuously absent. Rogan and other podcasters often criticize traditional media for silencing dissenting voices. That&#x2019;s fair. But when he speaks about Ukraine without inviting Ukrainian perspectives, doesn&#x2019;t he become the very thing he rails against? A show that prides itself on being a &#x201C;no-holds-barred&#x201D; forum for tough conversations can&#x2019;t ignore the glaring contradiction of excluding those most affected by the topic. The war Ukraine is fighting isn&#x2019;t just about NATO or territorial disputes &#x2014; it&#x2019;s about survival. Ukraine&#x2019;s struggle is about preserving a nation, culture, and right to live free from tyranny. These aren&#x2019;t abstract concepts or buzzwords for us; they&#x2019;re lived realities. Reducing them to fodder for a podcast feels not just dismissive but infuriating. American podcaster Joe Rogan (L) poses for a photo with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump (R) in New York City, NY, U.S., on Nov. 16, 2024. (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)I&#x2019;ve extended an open invitation to Rogan to have a real conversation &#x2014; to present the full picture, not just a one-sided narrative. Ironically, Rogan resembles the mainstream media he criticizes for distorting the truth, while I find myself in his usual role, trying to set the record straight. Quite the role reversal. But let&#x2019;s be honest &#x2014; Rogan likely won&#x2019;t respond. His goal isn&#x2019;t fostering genuine dialogue; it&#x2019;s reinforcing his narrative. He&#x2019;s playing to his audience, and challenging that dynamic isn&#x2019;t easy. Still, engaging voices like his isn&#x2019;t about ego &#x2014; it&#x2019;s about necessity. Rogan&#x2019;s comments serve as a wake-up call for anyone who argues &#x2014; like some did in response to my post on X &#x2014; that figures like me shouldn&#x2019;t &#x201C;lower themselves&#x201D; by engaging with people like him. Whether you like Rogan or not, his audience represents a critical segment of the conversation, including Americans who voted for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and whose views will shape the future of U.S.-Ukraine relations. Ignoring that reality doesn&#x2019;t make it go away. You can&#x2019;t break the echo chamber by pretending it doesn&#x2019;t exist. What Rogan may not understand about Ukrainians is that we&#x2019;re stubborn. We&#x2019;ve had to be. We&#x2019;ve built our strength not in gyms but in fields, factories, and battles. For centuries, we&#x2019;ve fought for our independence and our place in the world. So when someone comes after us, we don&#x2019;t back down. We engage &#x2014; with words, ideas, and, when necessary, fists. But as a diplomat and a fellow cigar aficionado, I suggested we start with a cigar.

Russian Defense Ministry admits that Ukraine hit airbase in Kursk Oblast with ATACMS	Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry admitted on Nov. 26 that Ukraine had targeted Russian S-400 air defense systems and an airfield in embattled Kursk Oblast with U.S.-made long-range ATACMS missiles over the past three days. The statement is the first public confirmation of the attacks by Russia, following multiple reports of strikes after Washington permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to the ministry, Ukrainian forces launched five ATACMS missiles on Nov. 23 near the village of Lotarevka, some 37 km northwest of Kursk, with three of them shot down. The other two missiles hit the positions of an S-400 surface-to-air missile division. &quot;The strike damaged a radar. There are casualties among the personnel,&quot; the Defense Ministry said. Previously, Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also claimed that Ukraine had struck a Russian S-400 radar in Kursk Oblast. &#xA0; Ukraine also fired eight ATACMS missiles on Nov. 25 at the Kursk Vostochny airbase in the town of Khalino in Kursk Oblast, seven of which were allegedly shot down by Russian air defenses, the Russian ministry claimed. One of the missiles &quot;reached its target,&quot; injuring two soldiers and damaging infrastructure, the ministry said. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. While OSINT analysts earlier reported the strike against the Russian airbase, the Ukrainian military has not commented on the attack.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-hits-airbase-in-kursk-oblast-with-atacms-missile-russian-defense-ministry-claims/	2024-11-26T07:22:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-26_15-09-07.jpg
Ukraine’s drones have a reputation for low cost. Buntar Aerospace wants to make them boutique	The day Russia invaded Ukraine, Ivan Kaunov watched from his 23rd-floor Kyiv apartment in disbelief as rockets came down on his city. He was 30, married, and running a fintech startup that was seeing remarkable traction. The scion of a Kyivan family that had gotten wealthy on construction and IT, Kaunov had gone to university for marketing, doing a student officer training program to satisfy Ukraine&#x2019;s theoretically mandatory but half-heartedly enforced nine-month military requirement &#x2014; &#xA0;training he never expected to use. &#x201C;I said &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll go fight if there&#x2019;s ever a war,&#x2019;&#x201D; chuckled Kaunov. &#x201C;I never thought it would happen. I was sure there would be no invasion. I was thinking, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s the 21st century.&#x2019;&#x201D; In mid-March 2022, he joined. Leading 150 fresh recruits to defend a village east of Bakhmut, he would find himself blown up by a rocket as his unit was pulling back from Russia&#x2019;s advance on the Donbas that May. A head injury meant rejoining infantry assaults was a no-go, but with drones, he could return to the fight. After spending around a year piloting mostly reconnaissance drones, Kaunov recognized the need for a more perfect guidance system. He assembled a wishlist of the best gear to put into a Ukrainian drone that would be meant for long-term, deep surveillance usage. He rallied enough interest to translate into funding for a prototype of the Buntar-1, the basis for his current company, Buntar Aerospace. Rather than fall to Russian jammers or a kamikaze attack, the envisioned Buntar &#x2014; the Ukrainian name for the Star Wars: Rogue movie &#x2014; would live to fly another day. Over the past year, Buntar has armed itself with nearly $3 million in investment from Ukraine, the EU, and the U.S. and is building what Kaunov hopes will be the Cadillac of Ukrainian surveillance drones &#x2013; high-cost, premium quality, and repeat usage &#x2014; in a major divergence from the cheap one-time kamikaze drones that have become symbols of Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russia&#x2019;s invasion. The company&apos;s latest model is the Buntar-3, a sleek machine to be sold in kits of two for some $200,000, decked out with Western components with the exception of Chinese wiring. The Buntar Aerospace team is currently taking the Buntar-3 along the front line for testing. Ukrainian drone pilots typically rely on cheap models &#x2014; initially Chinese-made consumer models like DJI Mavics &#x2014; but today, mostly analogs made in Ukraine. The assumption remains that most will fall in flight. Buntar says it is different in that it aims squarely for the top shelf of the market. The radios on the Buntar 1 are, for example, U.S. imports, a trio of high-end models from L3Harris, Persistent Systems MQ5, and Silvus. And the cameras, if including night vision, can run up to $75,000 &#x2014; the most expensive part of any recon drone. Buntar&#x2019;s premium drones recently started probing the front lines. But as with many of the most ambitious Ukrainian drone firms, the guiding light is not just to win the war, but, ultimately, the West, specifically a Western arms market that&#x2019;s been following the war in Ukraine raptly. The team recently began front-line tests on the Buntar-3 and boasts a connectivity time of 98% &#x2014; a massive improvement over the 30% of more rank-and-file drones that they attribute to the quality of components, which hail from the U.S. and U.K. in addition to Ukraine. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the biggest war since WWII. Lots of new technology, lots of electronic warfare,&#x201D; says Bohdan Sas, Buntar&#x2019;s Chief Technology Officer. &#x201C;Drones that were designed by civilian engineers for a civil environment before the war don&#x2019;t work in this war. So this is all custom.&#x201D; Beyond his experience at the front, the highly extroverted, heavily tatted, and always clean-shaven Kaunov is a convincing ambassador for the Buntar brand. His is a classic story of Ukraine&#x2019;s current generation of military tech startups: A soldier with a background in IT and Western financing who managed to blend the three into his own drone project. Kaunov&#x2019;s drone work lines up closely with the emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a game changer in Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russia. By 2023, the Ukrainian government understood it had a unique development on its hands and started pouring money into the domestic drone industry. That industry has grown rapidly and by many accounts is producing the majority of drones Ukraine is using on the front these days. The Buntar-1 in flight on June 29, 2024. takeoff at a test site in an undisclosed location, Ukraine on June 29, 2024. (Kollen Post / The Kyiv Independent)Given the ad-hoc means by which many drones make it to the front, hard numbers are tough to come by. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid-October that the government had already achieved its goal of one million Ukrainian drones produced in 2024. The Royal United Services Institute, a U.K.-based think tank, last year estimated Ukraine&#x2019;s drone losses at 10,000 units per month. Very few Ukrainian drones cost even the $20,000 that Buntar is asking for its cheaper recon drone, the Skyhopper. Buntar counts &#x201C;tens&#x201D; of its fixed-wing Skyhoppers already sold to the front. &#x201C;Each unit completes dozens of missions, maintaining high altitudes to avoid being shot down,&#x201D; says Kaunov. Thus far, Kaunov says only one Skyhopper has gone down &#x2014; due to friendly fire. &#x201C;I know exactly the tree it&#x2019;s in in no-man&#x2019;s land. Not worth trying to get,&#x201D; he says. The Buntar units 1, 2, and 3 are still in testing, with Buntar-1 seeing some performance at the front lines. Kaunov says the Buntar-3 has achieved a flight time of three hours &#x2014; putting it up there with the German Quantum Systems&#x2019; Vector and the Estonian Threod&#x2019;s EOS VTOL, two drones that Kaunov sees as future competitors, which similarly run nearly 200,000 euros per system. CoPilot, the company&#x2019;s navigating and auto-piloting software, is likely the most marketable of Buntar&#x2019;s products right now, provided it can readily adapt to new drone hardware and be brought on board new mission types. Software is easier to scale up than physical factories and the Ukrainian government maintains strict controls on the export of military goods. With its software registered abroad, CoPilot is theoretically free to go into the drone systems of foreign militaries. But here, Buntar has a leg up. Part of the firm&#x2019;s success is thanks to Kaunov&#x2019;s connections to the West, and, particularly, his knowledge of Western business financing. Prior to the full-scale invasion, his last project was FinMap, a still-functioning company selling B2B budgeting software. Kaunov&#x2019;s FinMap co-founder Oleksandr Solovei continues running FinMap today. As is typical of startups, Buntar remains a much more public-facing company than many of the massive drone makers who are at this point well-established in Ukraine but who keep relatively low profiles. Like FinMap, Buntar Aerospace operates via a U.K. company that has eased the process of getting Western investment and, Kaunov hopes, sales. Buntar has managed to gather up $2.7 million in funding in just 13 months of existence. By the standards of Silicon Valley, it&#x2019;s not a massive sum, but among the young generation of Ukrainian military tech startups, it&#x2019;s one of the larger publicly acknowledged war chests. Other leaders include drone software company Swarmer and disinformation startup Osavul, both using AI, who announced similar funding rounds in September. For comparison, many defense startups in Ukraine rely on $25,000 government grants to get off the ground. In addition to new drone models and workshops, Buntar has used the new funds to staff up, employing some 60 people, including Kaunov&#x2019;s father, Serhiy, and three brothers. Several of Buntar&#x2019;s investors remain unidentified. Buntar received a grant from Brave1, a government program for miltech, as well as various government awards. Private investors include several founders of Uklon, a Ukrainian equivalent to Uber. The funding allowed Buntar to acquire a smaller UAV manufacturer over the summer. Despite Buntar&#x2019;s financial savvy, questions remain about the battlefield readiness of Buntar drones. The Belgium-based Seven Capital is another early investor concerned about the core product. &#x201C;About Buntar, we&#x2019;ve had a lot of great feedback from investors. But not from the polihon (drone testing field). Not from soldiers. Not from our engineers,&#x201D; Brent Christiaens, founder and managing partner of Seven Capital, tells the Kyiv Independent. Buntar has already expanded rapidly, currently working on several updates to the Buntar-1, continued production of the Skyhopper, and a new line of kamikaze drones. The firm is currently working out production in the U.K., which would allow them to avoid the export controls currently holding more or less all drones made within Ukraine inside the country. Getting around those controls is, however, a controversial proposition during wartime. While the war guarantees local demand, it&#x2019;s tough to build a drone that can compensate investors and keep staff fed within Ukraine, where the Defense Ministry caps profits on military hardware at 25% over cost. Whether Western buyers will be open to a Ukrainian drone competing on equal footing with those built by German, U.K. or Israeli companies is a question that may well go unanswered until after the war. The Buntar team watch the Buntar-1 take off on June 29, 2024. takeoff at a test site in an undisclosed location, Ukraine on June 29, 2024. (Kollen Post / The Kyiv Independent)Buntar is in a fairly unique situation in that it has money and staff that allowed the project to draw eyes even before getting their first planes to market, thanks in no small part to Kaunov&#x2019;s marketing acumen. He anticipates the Skyhoppers, which Buntar prices at around $20,000, receiving a contract from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry before the end of this year, and says that the Buntar-3s just passed tests critical to securing such a contract of its own. But if the higher-end planes currently under testing don&#x2019;t pass muster, Buntar could well flounder. Kaunov anticipates a ceasefire of sorts in the next year but sees Ukraine continuing to buy up weapons for its arsenal afterward on the assumption that Russia will be back. Like many of his peers building defense tech in Ukraine, he&#x2019;s hopeful that before a ceasefire Buntar will prove itself in battle enough that Western militaries will clamor for it on the basis of quality, rather than cost. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-drones-have-a-reputation-for-low-cost-buntar-aerospace-wants-to-make-them-boutique/	2024-11-26T06:44:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/buntar-ground-rep.jpg
EU's upcoming Russia sanctions to target North Korean officials, Chinese, Indian companies, Ukrainian official says	The EU&apos;s 15th sanctions package will include 30 legal entities from at least eight countries and 50 individuals, the Ukrainian president&#x2019;s commissioner for sanctions, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, said on Nov. 26. According to Vlasiuk, &quot;companies that help Moscow obtain critical components&quot; will be on the sanction&#x2019;s list, &quot;including entities from Russia, Serbia, Iran, Hong Kong, China, India, the United Arab Emirates, and Thailand.&quot; The list will also include &quot;North Korean officials involved in the dispatch of troops to Russia,&quot; said the Ukrainian official who was involved in the package&apos;s preparations. North Korea is believed to have sent over 10,000 troops to boost Russian forces, with the first clashes with Ukraine already reported in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Ahead of the coming sanctions package, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called upon the EU not to sanction Chinese entities or individuals, claiming that China never supplied weapons to the parties to the conflict. Overwhelming evidence shows that Russian military hardware, especially drones, contain parts supplied by China. Recent reports indicate that the EU obtained evidence of China&apos;s production of &quot;lethal aid&quot; for Russia, namely attack drones. The upcoming package will also reportedly ban access for 45 Russian oil tankers to European ports and sanction oil transportation companies and their executives. Shortly after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU introduced sanctions on key figures of Russia&#x2019;s energy and military industry, curtailed Russia&apos;s access to Western-operated financial services, and froze Russia&#x2019;s assets held in Western bank accounts. Loopholes and malicious actors allowed countries and individuals to evade sanctions and continue doing business with Russia, necessitating the introduction of further packages and fine-tuning of the existing ones.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-15th-sanctions-package/	2024-11-26T06:10:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Supreme Court puts an end to oligarch Kolomoisky's appeal for restoring Privatbank ownership	Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court on Nov. 26 upheld earlier rulings on nationalizing Ukraine&apos;s largest bank and dismissed an appeal of its former owner Ihor Kolomoisky, ending a years-long case. Kolomoisky, one of the country&apos;s most well-known and controversial oligarchs, co-founded PrivatBank in 1992 but lost ownership to the state in 2016 after his management left a $5.5 billion hole in its balance sheet. The oligarch was later charged with embezzling $220 million from PrivatBank and has been in detention since September 2023 pending trial over multiple charges of fraud, illegal property acquisition, money laundering, and a murder plot. Kolomoisky is the richest businessman to be imprisoned in Ukraine&apos;s independent history. &quot;The Commercial Court of Cassation of the Supreme Court... rejected the cassation appeals of the former shareholders of PrivatBank Ihor Kolomoisky and the Cypriot company Triantal Investments Ltd.&quot; and upheld earlier rulings of the Commercial Court of the City of Kyiv from May and the Northern Commercial Court of Appeal from September, the statement read. The decision ended proceedings that had been ongoing for almost five years.	https://kyivindependent.com/kolomoisky-privatbank/	2024-11-26T05:40:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/kolomo.jpg
Russian soldiers suspected of executing 5 Ukrainian POWs near Pokrovsk	Russian forces apparently shot five unarmed Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in Donetsk Oblast earlier this November, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 26, launching a war crime investigation. According to the statement, Russian troops captured five Ukrainian defenders during an assault in the Pokrovsk sector. After forcing them to lay down their weapons and lie down on the ground, they are said to have shot them with automatic weapons. &quot;An investigation is currently underway to establish all the circumstances of the crime and the persons involved,&quot; the prosecutors&apos; statement read. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in the embattled Donetsk Oblast. Ukraine&#x2019;s Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said he had notified the United Nations and the Red Cross regarding the latest case from the Pokrovsk sector. &quot;I emphasize that the killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is qualified as a serious international crime,&quot; he wrote. Last week, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office reported two other Ukrainian POWs killed by Russian troops in the Pokrovsk sector. Law enforcement officers are investigating 53 criminal proceedings over the executions of 177 Ukrainian soldiers, while 37 proceedings of 109 executions were registered in 2024 alone, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office said on Nov. 22.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-soldiers-suspected-of-executing-5-ukrainian-pows-near-pokrovsk/	2024-11-26T05:08:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165903706.jpg
Opinion: Russia is leveraging gold and working with China to bypass Western sanctions	Since the West imposed unprecedented economic pressure on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the country&#x2019;s trade practices have undergone a dramatic transformation, with Russian international trade increasingly occurring in the shadows. Access to the goods it needs now depends on constant scheming. Given that Russia operates under informal rules, this shift comes naturally. Understanding this &#x2014; and, particularly, the role of Russia&#x2019;s new patron, China &#x2014; could help ensure that pressure on Russia&#x2019;s war economy is applied most effectively. History shows that when the Kremlin faces a crisis &#x2014; such as a war or a five-year plan &#x2014; officials and businesses become more entrepreneurial in an effort to meet extraordinary goals. Today, the Kremlin is encouraging officials and businesses to develop new workarounds &#x2014; informal or illicit activities &#x2014; that undermine conventional trading practices. These include the sale of Russia&#x2019;s most important commodity via a shadow fleet, the purchase of weapons with gold from Iran or North Korea, and a growing network of import-export entrepreneurs who channel foreign goods to Russia through third countries. Russia&#x2019;s most pressing trade challenge is how to pay foreign counterparts concerned about secondary sanctions, especially in China, on which Russia has become increasingly dependent for imports. Three trends are clear. First, Russia is formalizing informal trading. This began in 2022 with the legalization of gray imports, but now includes barter trading and exchange in kind. Barter trading has a long history in Russia, given its commodity-based economy, with the state historically striking deals for natural resources. However, barter relies on willing trade partners, and it remains to be seen how widespread it will become. Second, the Russian state is scrambling to create payment systems that avoid exposure to, or provide an alternative to, the dollar. As we saw during the recent BRICS conference in Kazan, these include central bank-backed digital currencies. While such systems may work in principle, Russian technologies often rely on foreign cooperation and components, and it remains unclear whether the Kremlin can count on uptake from its BRICS partners.

(Valery Shatifulin / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)A third trend is the use of gold and other precious stones, such as diamonds, as payment. This may be Russia&#x2019;s most promising workaround payment option. Russia is a major gold producer and hoarder, consistently producing over 300 tonnes of gold annually. Russian interests also control large stakes in gold-producing countries in Eurasia and Africa. Thus, even if Russia spends its gold, it has ample access to more. As recent research by RAND has shown, over the last 20 years, Russia&#x2019;s central bank has acquired nearly 2,000 tonnes of gold &#x2014; more than any other country by a wide margin. Moreover, the state regularly adds to a vault controlled by the Ministry of Finance, which holds an undisclosed amount of gold and precious stones that can be used at Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s discretion. There is little doubt that Russia is already using gold to pay for goods it cannot procure conventionally, or for transactions it wishes to obscure. An open-source investigation by Sayari, for example, revealed that unsanctioned banks were trading gold for cash in Turkey. Russia has also partly paid Iranian drone manufacturer Sahara Thunder in gold for 6,000 Shahed drones and related equipment. While it&#x2019;s unclear how much of a role gold plays in Russia&#x2019;s trade with China, it is certainly &#xA0;becoming a growing feature. Russian gold exports to China increased after the U.S., UK, and EU banned Russian gold imports in 2022. Chinese demand for gold has been very high from 2022 to the second half of this year, when rising gold prices slowed purchasing. According to World Gold Council data, the People&#x2019;s Bank of China has acquired more gold during this period than any other country. It&#x2019;s plausible that Beijing, like Moscow, holds undisclosed gold, as its declared reserves represent less than 5% of its overall holdings &#x2014; far less than comparable economies. Indeed, around half of global gold purchases since March are unaccounted for, and it&#x2019;s unclear what is driving such high demand. In 2023, China became a key hub for Russia&#x2019;s international gold trade after secondary sanctions deterred the UAE, which had become Russia&#x2019;s main partner after the West banned Russian gold imports. On the surface, China does not appear to covet Russian gold, given its security of supply and investments in foreign gold assets, including in Afghanistan, Ghana, and Tajikistan. Additionally, China does not hold significant investments in Russia&#x2019;s largest gold mining companies. It&#x2019;s also unclear how much Russian gold ore China now refines, since international demand for Russia-refined gold bars has fallen since 2022. However, the development of gold relations deserves further attention, especially considering the rising demand for gold among Chinese consumers, which may increase due to concerns over the stability of the domestic economy and potential renewed trade tensions with the incoming U.S. administration. If relations with the U.S. worsen, China may be more willing to collaborate with Russia in the creation of a de-dollarized trading bloc, where gold could play a significant role. This has already become an important rhetorical theme in their relations, and both Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have declared their intent to deepen cooperation at the BRICS summit. Recent reports suggest that China is providing direct support to Russian defense production, signaling that China is more willing to risk Western sanctions than previously thought. In August, China tightened controls on payments with Russian companies, causing delays in bilateral trade. However, it has not prevented traders from using gold to settle payments for Russian businesses. Reporting indicates that Russian companies have been selling gold in Hong Kong and depositing the proceeds in local bank accounts to pay Chinese suppliers in lieu of using yuan or rubles directly. In this way, China is tolerating Russian workarounds &#x2014; a form of preemptive sanctions evasion. Chinese tolerance for Russia-related risk is not unlimited, but it is clearly supporting Russia&#x2019;s workaround trade. The pressure on Beijing to assist Moscow is unlikely to subside, and gold offers a range of possibilities to extend and obfuscate their cooperation.

Russia confirms capture of UK national fighting for Ukraine	Russian authorities confirmed on Nov. 26 the capture and detention of James Scott Rhys Anderson, a U.K. national fighting for Ukraine in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The Russian Investigative Committee charged Anderson with &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;mercenarism,&quot; following its long-standing practice of persecuting foreign volunteers that end up in Russian captivity. A video purportedly showing the captured volunteer surfaced on Telegram channels on Nov. 24. Speaking with an English accent, the man identified himself as Anderson, a 22-year-old ex-British army signalman who, in his own words, came to Ukraine and joined the International Legion. Russia often presents foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war. Scott Anderson, the 22-year-old&apos;s father, told the Daily Mail that he &quot;was in complete shock and in tears&quot; when the fighter&apos;s commander sent him the video. &quot;I could see straight away it was him. He looks frightened, scared, and worried,&quot; Scott Anderson said, voicing fears that his son would be tortured in prison. Two other Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, were captured by Russian forces in Mariupol in 2022 and sentenced to death before being released in a prisoner exchange. Russia has ramped up pressure in Kursk Oblast to dislodge Ukrainian troops holding positions there since early August. Reuters reported on Nov. 23 that Ukraine had lost over 40% of territory previously captured during the incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-captures-uk-volunteer/	2024-11-26T04:28:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166685846.jpg
Ukraine's Defense Ministry investigating faulty mortar shells following complaints	An interdepartmental commission is investigating the supply of faulty 120 mm mortar shells to Ukrainian forces after multiple reports of them misfiring, the Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 26. The statement comes following complaints and videos shared on social media that show the mortar shells not exploding or failing to hit their targets. The ministry said it had withdrawn the batches of ammunition in question and would instead provide Ukrainian forces with imported shells. The Dzerkalo Tyzhnia news outlet reported in its investigation that this concerns 100,000 shells that would last for six months of front-line use, causing delays before the imported shells arrive. Artillery and mortar shells are crucial items on the front as Ukraine already struggles to match up with the better-stocked Russian forces. According to Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, the supply of the shells in question was a result of a deal between the Defense Ministry and the Strategic Industries Ministry to purchase ammunition from a domestic producer and thus decrease dependence on foreign supplies. The outlet did not name the factory commissioned to manufacture the shells but said it was part of the state-owned defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom and was often targeted by Russian attacks. The media investigation highlighted the Defense Ministry&apos;s supposedly inadequate quality control process. Warnings raised by some officials regarding the plant&apos;s ability to produce detonators for the shells &quot;disappeared&quot; during the process, and military officials failed to report initial problems with the shells that surfaced in September. In its statement, the Defense Ministry stressed that the Strategic Industries Ministry was responsible for carrying out the order. Preliminary conclusions named low-quality charges and poor storage conditions as possible causes. The State Bureau of Investigation has launched a criminal investigation, and &quot;appropriate personnel decisions will be made regarding the responsible officials,&quot; the statement read. The ministry promised new measures to improve quality control and improve the inspection process at all stages. Ukraine&apos;s defense sector has been plagued by several major procurement scandals throughout the full-scale war. The two most notorious scandals, one regarding inflated prices for food supplies and the other connected to low-quality winter jackets, prompted the dismissal of former Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-defense-ministry-investigating-faulty-mortar-shells/	2024-11-26T03:55:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182940696--1-.jpg
NATO Parliamentary Assembly calls for Ukraine's accession 'as soon as possible'	Delegates from NATO member states&#x2019; legislatures voiced their support for Ukraine becoming the 33rd member of the alliance in a resolution adopted by the NATO Parliamentary Assembly on Nov. 25. Independent from NATO, the assembly has no direct role in overseeing NATO policies. The assembly urged member states &quot;to step up political and practical efforts to help Ukraine receive an invitation and become the 33rd member of NATO as soon as possible,&quot; the resolution read. Kyiv submitted its application to join in September 2022, and in July 2024, the alliance affirmed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership&quot; &#x2014; though Ukraine has not received any definitive news about its future accession. Seven countries, including the U.S., Germany, and Hungary, are reluctant to greenlight a fast accession for Ukraine, Politico reported in October. Kyiv&apos;s entry would require a unanimous agreement among all 32 members. Members of the Assembly also urged for sustaining and increasing the &quot;military, financial, and humanitarian support for Ukraine, ensuring the timely delivery of munitions and advanced weapon systems, including air defense systems, long-range precision weapons, and multi-role fighter aircraft.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-parliamentary-assembly-ukraine/	2024-11-26T03:02:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416185.jpg
Russia launches record 188 drones against Ukraine overnight, Air Force says	Russia launched a record number of 188 Shaheds and other drones against Ukraine in a single night on Nov. 26, the Air Force said. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly shot down 76 drones across 17 oblasts, while 95 were &quot;lost,&quot; presumably thanks to electronic warfare means. Five drones flew to Belarus, according to the Air Force. Russia has deployed cheap &quot;kamikaze&quot; drones, like the Iranian-made Shaheds, against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure since the first year of the full-scale war. Moscow has intensified the drone attacks in recent months, with air raid alerts sounding daily in major cities like Kyiv. &quot;During the overnight attack, Russia launched a record number of Shahed-type attack drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles of an unknown type from the directions of Orel, Bryans, Kursk, and Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Russia,&quot; the Air Force&apos;s statement read. Moscow launched more than 2,000 strike drones against Ukraine in October, breaking the previous record set in September by nearly 700, according to Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. Talking to the parliament on Nov. 19, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had set a goal of developing an effective countermeasure to Shahed-type drone attacks. Ukraine was also attacked by four Iskander-M ballistic missiles overnight on Nov. 26, the Air Force said. At least two people were killed and over 40 injured in Russian attacks over the past day.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-record-188-drones-against-ukraine-overnight/	2024-11-26T02:45:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Ex-Minister Kuleba calls out Joe Rogan over 'freaking at Ukrainians,' asks for 'real conversation'	Ukraine&apos;s Former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Nov. 25 called out Joe Rogan for not allowing a pro-Ukrainian voice into his podcast after the popular U.S. podcaster lashed out against Ukraine over supposedly &quot;starting World War III.&quot; &quot;Freaking at Ukrainians without giving them a chance to speak isn&#x2019;t a fair fight,&quot; Kuleba wrote on X. &quot;If you ever feel like having a real conversation, let&#x2019;s sit down and chat about anything Ukraine-related &#x2013; dragons included. You know your stuff, I know mine. Cigars on me,&quot; he added. Kuleba&apos;s rebuke follows that of former professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko, who accused Rogan of &quot;repeating Russian propaganda&quot; after the U.S. podcaster lambasted Washington&apos;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia. Joe Rogan is one of the most popular podcasters in the world, with over 18 million followers on YouTube. In his recent episode, Rogan voiced fears that outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision on long-range strikes could lead to World War III. &quot;How are you allowed to do that when you are on your way out. Like people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore, maybe that would be a good thing we would like to avoid from a dying former president. The whole thing is nuts,&quot; Rogan said in a recent episode. During the electoral campaign, Rogan endorsed Donald Trump, who criticized military aid for Ukraine and said he would bring both sides to the negotiating table. The Biden administration has sought to speed up military support for Kyiv before Trump takes office in January. &quot;(Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr) Zelensky says Putin is terrified. F**k you, man. You f**king people are about to start World War III,&quot; Rogan said. Kuleba has been in office between 2020 and September 2024. He has been at the forefront of Ukraine&apos;s efforts to engage its international allies and secure new partnerships since the beginning of the full-scale war.	https://kyivindependent.com/kuleba-joe-rogan/	2024-11-26T02:06:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168226157.jpg
Russian lawmakers submit bill on Taliban's removal from terrorist list	A group of Russian lawmakers submitted a bill that would allow the Taliban Islamist movement to be removed from Russia&apos;s list of terrorist organizations, the State Duma&apos;s website said on Nov. 25. This comes as another step toward normalization of relations between Russia and the Taliban since the radical group seized power in Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021. If approved, the legislation will allow the Taliban to be delisted as a banned terror group if it &quot;stops carrying out activities aimed at promoting, justifying, and supporting terrorism.&quot; The bill was submitted by seven senators and five Duma members from the ruling United Russia party and the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR). Taliban is recognized as a terrorist group by the U.S., Canada, United Arab Emirates, and other countries. Its rule, which is not recognized by the international community, has been accompanied by a harsh crackdown on civil liberties and women&apos;s and minority rights. Russia has maintained contact with the Taliban-ruled Afghanistan without officially recognizing the new authorities. Russia&apos;s Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu visited Afghanistan on Nov. 25, saying that the removal of the Taliban from the list of terrorist groups is in its &quot;final stage.&quot; &quot;Let me confirm our readiness to establish a constructive political dialogue between our countries and among the goals would be providing an impulse for the process of a settlement among Afghans,&quot; Shoigu reportedly said. &quot;We have tried to ensure conditions for a growth in exports of Afghan goods and a growth in foreign investment.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-taliban-duma/	2024-11-26T01:52:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2175722618.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 2, wound 45 over past day	Russian attacks against Ukraine injured at least 45 people and killed at least two over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 26. In Kharkiv&#x2019;s Kyivskyi city district, a Russian S-400 missile injured 26 people and damaged more than 40 buildings and five cars, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel. In the town of Kupiansk, a Russian drone injured a 66-year-old man after crashing near an educational institution building. An air raid alert in Kyiv lasted for seven hours last night while Ukrainian air defenses downed Russian drones over the city. No casualties were reported, the regional military administration said. During a night attack on Ternopil Oblast, a critical infrastructure facility was damaged, causing blackouts, the regional military administration reported. One person died, and four were injured as a result of the Russian military&#x2019;s attack on critical infrastructure and residential areas of Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on his Telegram channel. One person was killed and another injured in Donetsk Oblast, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a 48-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man were injured in Nikopol due to a kamikaze drone strike, Governor Serhii Lysak reported on his Telegram channel. A gas station and a car were also damaged in the attack. In Odesa, the Russian military struck the center of the city, injuring 11 people and leaving one woman in a serious condition, Governor Oleh Kiper reported on his Telegram channel. &#x200C;&#x200C; The missile strike damaged residential buildings, cars, a dentist&apos;s clinic, a beauty salon, shops, and cars. Two educational institutions&#x2014;a school and a university gym&#x2014;were also damaged. &#x200C;&#x200C;&#x200C;&#x200C;In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 74-year-old man was wounded following a Russian strike, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported on his Telegram channel. Overnight on Nov. 26, the Russian military attacked Ukraine with four Iskander-M ballistic missiles from the Voronezh and Kursk regions. During the night attack, Russia also launched 188 Shaheds and other unidentified drones, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force reported. Air defense shot down 76 drones over 17 oblasts while 95 drones were lost across the country, and five of them left Ukraine&#x2019;s airspace to Belarus, the Air Force said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-2/	2024-11-26T01:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Odesa-Nov_-25.jpg
51% of Americans oppose military aid for Ukraine, poll shows	U.S. citizens remain split on whether to continue sending military support to Ukraine, with a razor-thin majority voicing opposition, according to a CBS/YouGov poll published on Nov. 25. While 49% of the respondents said the military support should continue, 51% were against it, underscoring the persistent divide in the U.S. society on the matter. The survey came at the heels of Donald Trump&apos;s election victory, which sparked concerns about the U.S. withdrawing its crucial support for Ukraine. Ukraine initially enjoyed bipartisan support in the U.S. at the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, but a part of the Republican Party has grown increasingly reluctant as the war progressed. The Republican-led House of Representatives delayed for months the approval of a $61 billion aid bill earlier this year, directly contributing to Ukraine&apos;s battlefield setbacks and underscoring how vital U.S. support is for Kyiv. Responding to a question on &quot;how much priority should (Trump) put on developing policies and plans to try to limit aid to Ukraine,&quot; 33% deemed it to be a high priority, 36% a medium priority, and 31% said it was not a priority at all. The survey involved a bipartisan pool of 2,232 respondents and was carried out between Nov. 19 and 22. In an earlier poll published by Pew Research in July, 48% of respondents said that the U.S. has a responsibility to aid Ukraine, while 49% said it does not. Democratic and Democratic-leaning respondents were more likely to give a positive answer.	https://kyivindependent.com/51-of-americans-oppose-aid-to-ukraine-poll-shows/	2024-11-26T00:35:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1244028095.jpg
UK not planning to send its soldiers to Ukraine, foreign secretary says	London is not planning to deploy its military personnel on the ground in Ukraine, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told journalists at the G7&apos;s ministerial meeting on Nov. 25. Lammy&apos;s comments came after the French outlet Le Monde reported that the U.K. and France have been discussing deploying soldiers or private defense contractors in Ukraine following Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election. &quot;We are not committing U.K. troops on the ground to Ukraine, but we continue to support Ukraine with training and military assistance, and we have been absolutely clear that we will continue to do that for as long as is required and is needed,&quot; Lammy said. &quot;That is certainly the U.K. position and remains the U.K. position at this time.&quot; French President Emmanuel Macron previously suggested deploying military trainers to Ukraine, but the idea has met strong opposition among several key allies, namely Germany. Le Monde wrote, citing undisclosed sources, that the matter was brought up during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&apos;s visit to France on Nov. 11. The U.K. and France are reportedly considering taking the lead in the pro-Kyiv coalition in the light of Trump&apos;s reelection. Trump has criticized military support for Ukraine and pledged to bring a quick end to the war, sparking fears he might withdraw Washington&apos;s crucial backing. Responding to a question about France deploying its troops in Ukraine, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the media that France would &quot;not discard any option.&quot; While the G7 foreign ministers were meeting in Italy, the defense ministers of the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Poland met in Berlin in a new &quot;E5 format&quot; to discuss increasing defense spending and supporting Ukraine. Speaking at the meeting, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius pledged to keep the Ukraine Defense Contact Group &quot;alive,&quot; while his British counterpart, John Healey, said that Europe must &quot;double&quot; its support for Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-not-sending-its-soldiers-to-ukraine-lammy/	2024-11-25T23:50:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2171444035.jpg
Russia's advance in Ukraine fastest since early 2022, analysts claim	The advance of Russian forces in Ukraine continues to gain pace, reaching a new weekly and monthly record, the independent Russian outlet Agentstvo reported on Nov. 25, citing its analysis of the DeepState monitoring group&apos;s data. Russia has captured 234.79 square kilometers (90 square miles) in the past week, which is the highest number in 2024, according to the analysis. Russian forces have taken 600 square kilometers (232 square miles) since the start of November, which is more than in the entire October, setting a new record since early 2022, Agentstvo wrote. The development comes at a critical moment as Ukraine faces the prospect of decreased U.S. support under Donald Trump&apos;s administration. As the president-elect pledged to bring both sides to the negotiating table, battlefield losses are likely to put Ukraine at a weakened position. The advance is reportedly the fastest near Velyka Novosilka, a village in southern Donetsk Oblast close to the administrative border with Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Ukrainian officials have increasingly raised concerns about a possible new Russian push in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the south, just as Russian forces continue to advance in the east, focusing their efforts near Pokrovsk and Kurakhove. According to Agentstvo&apos;s analysis of DeepState data, Russia captured around 187 square kilometers (72 square miles) in the south. Moscow&apos;s troops have also reportedly advanced 33 square kilometers (12.7 square miles) near Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in Donetsk Oblast, 10 square kilometers (3.8 square miles) in the east of Kharkiv Oblast, and 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) near Chasiv Yar. The Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify the claims. Russia&apos;s advance has picked up pace over the past months as Ukraine&apos;s military struggles to replenish its ranks, and Western arms were not flowing in as fast as Kyiv would have hoped. The outgoing Biden administration seeks to speed up materiel deliveries before Trump takes office. Washington has provided Ukraine&apos;s forces with new capabilities to stall the Russian advance, such as long-range strikes on Russian territory or anti-personnel mines.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-advance-in-ukraine-fastest-since-early-2022-analysts-say/	2024-11-25T23:10:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1239451817.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 733,830 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 733,830 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 26. This number includes 1,480 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,435 tanks, 19,256 armored fighting vehicles, 30,042 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,806 artillery systems, 1,254 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,004 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,552 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-733-830-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-25T22:28:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150597884.jpg
Estonia’s defense chief urges financial aid for Ukraine over foreign troop deployments, The Hill reports	Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said during the Halifax International Security Forum that Ukraine needs greater investment in its military production capabilities, not foreign troops on its battlefield. Speaking to The Hill, Pevkur stressed that Ukraine could manage its defense effectively if supplied with the necessary resources. &quot;As far as I know, Ukrainians can handle all of this, when we can deliver all what they need for fighting with Russia,&quot; Pevkur said. Pevkur highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s growing capacity to produce military equipment, including howitzers at six to seven times the rate of France. However, he noted a critical funding gap: &quot;Their industry is really ramping up production... but it only has $15 billion to spend, while its capacity is about $30 billion. So when you don&#x2019;t have anything to give from your own stockpiles, give them money. It&#x2019;s a simple message,&quot; he told The Hill. Reflecting on Ukraine&#x2019;s past counteroffensives, Pevkur called the lack of sufficient equipment during the surprise Kursk incursion in August a missed opportunity. &quot;There was a huge momentum in this war during the Kursk counteroffensive, but that time, Ukrainians didn&#x2019;t have enough equipment or enough firepower to push even further,&quot; he said. He urged Western allies to commit fully to helping Ukraine achieve victory, rather than merely sustaining its fight. Pevkur warned that the next six months of political transitions in the U.S. and Europe could embolden adversaries like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Estonia remains vigilant against potential hybrid attacks, with Pevkur citing suspected Russian cyberattacks, sabotage of Baltic undersea cables, and interference with flight communications as examples of ongoing threats. &quot;We know very clearly what Russia is capable of... That is why the prevention of those kinds of attacks, also reaction to those kinds of attacks, is very, very important,&quot; he said.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonias-defense-chief-urges-financial-aid-for-ukraine-over-foreign-troop-deployments-the-hill-reports/	2024-11-25T21:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2160736180.jpg
Germany to deliver 2 IRIS-T air defense systems to Ukraine by year's end, ministry says	Germany will supply Ukraine with two additional IRIS-T air defense systems, including the medium-range SLM and short-range SLS models, by the end of the year, Major General Christian Freuding, head of the Bundeswehr&apos;s Situation Center Ukraine, told journalists in Kyiv on Nov. 25. &quot;The next IRIS-T SLM (medium-range) and SLS (short-range) systems should arrive in Ukraine in the coming days and weeks, before Christmas,&quot; Freuding was quoted as saying. He added that Germany&#x2019;s support for Ukraine would continue beyond Christmas and the Feb. 23 federal elections in Germany. On Nov. 13, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine would receive the sixth German IRIS-T air defense system by the end of the year following his call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Ukraine will then have a total of seven systems in its arsenal. The IRIS-T is a state-of-the-art surface-to-air missile system designed to counter aircraft, helicopters, drones, and cruise missiles. In September, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced plans to deliver an additional 17 IRIS-T systems, further bolstering Ukraine&apos;s defensive capabilities. Germany has been a key defense partner for Ukraine since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, providing a range of equipment, including IRIS-T and Patriot air defense systems, anti-aircraft and artillery systems, armored vehicles, Leopard tanks, drones, and ammunition. On Nov. &#xA0;20, the German government announced a new military aid package featuring howitzers, vehicles, and hundreds of drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-to-deliver-2-iris-t-air-defense-systems-to-ukraine-by-years-end-ministry-says/	2024-11-25T20:34:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169569133.jpg
UK boosts Kyiv's arsenal with more Storm Shadows amid Starmer's support pledge, Bloomberg reports	The U.K. has delivered dozens of Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine, Bloomberg reports, marking the first major arms transfer under Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#x2019;s leadership. The unannounced shipments carried out weeks ago, were ordered after Ukrainian forces faced shortages of long-range missiles, according to sources familiar with the matter. Officials speaking to Bloomberg, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information, confirmed that the missiles were supplied before the U.K. and the U.S. authorized Ukraine to target locations inside Russia with long-range weapons. The exact timeline and quantity of the shipment remain undisclosed. &quot;We do not comment on operational detail, to do so would only benefit [Russian President Vladimir Putin],&quot; the Ministry of Defense told Bloomberg. The ministry reiterated the U.K.&#x2019;s &quot;ironclad&quot; support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukrainian forces recently used the Storm Shadow missiles to strike Russian targets in the western Bryansk region, one day after deploying U.S.-made ATACMS in similar operations. At the G20 summit in Brazil on Nov. 20, Starmer said his government was &quot;doubling down&quot; on its support for Ukraine but avoided disclosing specifics. Ukraine had previously used Storm Shadows against Russian forces in the Black Sea, though the U.K. government has not confirmed the total number supplied since the war began. The missiles, manufactured by MBDA, a defense company that provides missile systems for each branch of the armed forces, are precision-guided and boast a range exceeding 250 kilometers. Equipped with advanced navigation systems, they are designed to fly close to terrain at high speeds, enhancing their effectiveness in striking critical targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-boosts-kyivs-arsenal-with-more-storm-shadows-amid-starmers-support-pledge-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-25T17:51:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1905088005.jpg
No indication North Korean troops are moving into Ukraine, Pentagon says	The United States does not have any indication that there is a presence of North Korean troops in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said on Nov. 25. &quot;What we&apos;re seeing is that (North Korean troops are) positioned around the Kursk region, not moving into Ukraine at the moment,&quot; Singh said during a press briefing. The Pentagon&apos;s statement clarifies reports of approximately 11,000 North Korean troops amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, training alongside Russian troops in the fight against Ukraine. A Pentagon spokesperson said on Nov. 13 that some North Korean troops have already been deployed to fight together with Russian forces. A source with Ukraine&apos;s General Staff also indicated to Reuters on Nov. 23 that the majority of North Korean soldiers were finalizing training. In recent months, Russia has focused on regaining territory lost in the country&apos;s Kursk Oblast following a surprise Ukrainian incursion into the region in August. According to the source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, the Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations. Addressing unconfirmed reports that upwards of 500 North Korean troops have been killed in Kursk, Singh said that the U.S. could not independently confirm the casualties. &quot;What we&apos;ve said before is that they&apos;re in (the Kursk) region and certainly poised to engage the Ukrainians in combat. But I can&apos;t confirm those reports that there have been casualties yet.&quot; Moscow and Pyongyang signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, pledging to provide military support to one another if either country comes under attack. On Nov. 25, Reuters reported, citing researchers at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, that North Korea is expanding a key weapons production complex that assembles KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles used by Russia against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/no-indication-north-korean-troops-are-moving-into-ukraine-pentagon-says/	2024-11-25T17:20:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
G7 allies expected to increase pressure on China over support for Russia, Bloomberg reports	The foreign ministers of Group of Seven (G7) countries are expected to agree to increase diplomatic pressure on China over the country&apos;s support for Russia&apos;s &apos;war machine&apos; in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 25, citing an early draft of a communique seen by the publication. The draft communique, which vows to introduce &quot;appropriate measures consistent with our legal systems, against actors in China and in other third countries,&quot; is still in development as G7 foreign ministers meet in Italy on Nov. 25-26, Bloomberg reported. If adopted, the language of the communique would mark an escalation among G7 allies, with an April communique simply calling for China to &quot;ensure&quot; that it stops supporting Russia with dual-use goods. The reported draft communique comes as G7 allies attempt to increase pressure, as well as support for Ukraine, ahead of the January inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump &#x2014; who has repeatedly criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine and vowed to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war as soon as possible. The draft communique is also expected to reaffirm the G7&apos;s &quot;unwavering commitment&quot; to Ukraine. The escalatory tone comes as Western allies have reportedly accused China of militarily supporting Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reported on Sept. 25, citing European intelligence sources, that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war. The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Nov. 15, citing three EU officials. According to the draft communique, G7 allies will also &quot;continue to apply significant pressure on Russian revenues from energy, metals and other commodities through the effective implementation of existing measures and further actions against (Russia&apos;s) &#x2018;shadow fleet&#x2019;&quot; &#x2014; referring to Moscow&#x2019;s efforts to evade sanctions on the $60-per-barrel oil price cap imposed two years ago. Earlier on Nov. 25, the United Kingdom sanctioned 30 oil tankers of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; that carried billions of dollars worth of oil and oil products last year. Draft communiques are often subject to revision before a final draft is approved. China has repeatedly claimed to have positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war, but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Earlier in July, NATO&apos;s then-Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that allies agreed that Beijing is a &quot;decisive enabler&quot; of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-expected-to-increase-pressure-on-china-over-support-for-russia-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-25T14:20:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2152601390.jpg
Record number of Russian attack drones entered Belarus overnight, monitoring group says	A record 38 Russian Shahed-type attack drones entered Belarusian territory overnight on Nov. 24-25, with at least one of the drones reportedly shot down by the Belarusian Air Force, the monitoring group Belarusian Hajun reported. The airspace intrusions, which have increased in recent months, comes as Russia continues to intensify its drone attacks against Ukrainian cities. Russia launched a total of 145 drones at Ukrainian targets overnight, with Ukrainian air defenses downing 71 of the attack drones, Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said. The incident, marking the largest Russian drone incursion into Belarusian airspace since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marks one of the rare occasions when a Belarusian aircraft has downed a drone entering its airspace. Belarus&apos; military confirmed downing a Russian drone over its territory for the first time on Sept. 5. According to Belarusian Hajun, the Belarusian Air Force scrambled fighter jets four times over the past 24 hours to counter the attack drones. The monitoring group reported that the majority of the attack drones passed along Belarus&apos; southern border with Ukraine, particularly in Homel Oblast. Minsk has never publicly raised objections to Moscow &#x2013; its key ally &#x2013; over the reported drone incidents. Despite not being directly involved in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Belarus hosts Russian troops and missiles on its territory. The attacks come as Russia continues to increase its attacks against civilian targets, amid an expected harsh winter plagued by energy shortages. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 2 that Russia launched over 2,000 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in October, with the Air Force previously reporting that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. Later in the day on Nov. 25, a Russian drone attacked the village of Solonchaky in Mykolaiv Oblast while humanitarian aid was being distributed there, injuring five people with both aid workers and residents among the victims.	https://kyivindependent.com/record-number-of-russian-attack-drones-entered-belarusian-territory-overnight-monitoring-group-says/	2024-11-25T12:53:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1242279354.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukrainian drones reportedly hit oil depot in Russia's Kaluga Oblast	Key developments on Nov. 25: Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) hit an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 25. The Kaluganefteprodukt oil facility, which is used to support Russian aggression against Ukraine, was struck by drones at 0:30 a.m. on Nov. 25, leading to a fire, the source claimed. The successful attack was later confirmed by the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Kaluga, a city of roughly 340,000 people, lies approximately 290 kilometers (180 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Videos shared on local Telegram channels showed a fire and active air defenses in the city. Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha claimed that eight drones were shot down overnight, resulting in a fire at an industrial facility that was later extinguished. The official did not provide further details on possible damage and said there had been no casualties. According to Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, drones also targeted Kaluga&apos;s Taifun (Typhoon) factory, which produces radio-electronic equipment, missile and aviation components, and other military supplies. It remains unclear whether the Taifun factory suffered damage, as the target was not mentioned by the HUR source. Ukrainian forces also struck Russian targets in the Bryansk and Kursk oblasts overnight on Nov. 25, the General Staff reported. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims. Ukraine used U.S.-supplied longe-range ATACMS missile to strike targets inside Russia, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told journalists on Nov. 25. The confirmation by Washington came days after reports that Kyiv launched ATACMS missiles at a military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. The strikes with Western-made missiles were also reported in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Right now, they (Ukrainian soldiers) have the ability to use ATACMS to defend themselves in an immediate-need basis. Understandably, that&apos;s taken place in and around Kursk Oblast,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;We did change the guidance and gave them guidance that they can use them to strike these particular types of targets.&quot; Russia launched an attack against the central part of Kharkiv on the morning of Nov. 25, injuring at least 23 people, officials reported. Thirteen people have been hospitalized, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on his Telegram channel. The victims were at work or walking down the street, Spartak Borysenko, head of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office, told the Suspilne broadcaster. The Russian military likely struck a densely populated residential area in central Kharkiv with an S-400 missile, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported on his Telegram channel. &quot;(The missile) landed in a yard surrounded by multi-story buildings. Buildings and cars caught fire,&quot; he wrote. According to Borysenko, at least five cars were damaged, while the number of damaged buildings is still being determined. Later in a day, Russia also launched a missile attack against downtown Odesa, injuring at least 11 people, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. The aftermath of a Russian attack on the city of Odesa on Nov. 25, 2024. (State Emergency Service)Ukraine&apos;s 3rd Brigade liberated Kharkiv Oblast village, took POWsUkraine&#x2019;s Third Assault Brigade said on Nov. 25 that it pushed Russian troops out of the Kopanky village in Kharkiv Oblast, taking several prisoners of war (POW) from Russia&#x2019;s First Tank Army. Russian forces were reportedly pushed out after they attempted to break into Kopanky, a village in eastern Kharkiv Oblast close to the administrative border with Luhansk Oblast. The settlement lies around 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Kupiansk, a key logistics hub under increasing pressure from Russian troops. In a video published by the unit, seven POWs are seen in a basement-like room during a filmed interrogation. According to the unit, the POWs&apos; positions came under artillery fire from the Russian military after their capture. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the unit&#x2019;s claims or where the video was recorded. Ukraine is actively working on developing its own guided aerial bombs, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Anatolii Barhylevych reported on Nov. 24. &quot;We are actively working on it. I think we will achieve such success,&quot; he said on national television. According to Barhylevych, Russia holds the largest stockpile of aerial bombs inherited from the Soviet Union. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles but are far cheaper to produce. When launched from aircraft within Russian territory or Russian-occupied territories, they are beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defense.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-43/	2024-11-25T12:48:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-25-203124.png

UN has recorded 376 sexual violence cases related to Russian war against Ukraine	A total of 376 cases of sexual violence have been documented during Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) reported on Nov. 25. The figure includes 262 men, most of whom were tortured in captivity on occupied territories or in Russia, 104 women, as well as children &#x2014; 10 girls and two boys, according to the report. &quot;War-related sexual violence is a violation of international human rights, humanitarian and criminal law,&quot; the mission said. &quot;Preventing this kind of violence and bringing perpetrators to justice is a shared responsibility based on states&apos; human rights obligations.&quot; In April, Ukraine&apos;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya told the U.N. Security Council that Russia uses sexual violence as a weapon against civilians and prisoners of war. Citing testimonies from people released from Russian captivity, Kyslytsya said that over 50 percent of detainees suffered torture, rape, or other forms of sexual violence. The Kyiv Independent in June identified two Russian soldiers who were involved in the rape of two women during the occupation of Kyiv and Kherson oblasts in March 2022. Subsequently, Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office charged one of them, Mykola Senenko, with raping a woman in Kherson Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-records-over-370-sexual-violence-cases-related-to-russian-war-against-ukraine/	2024-11-25T10:01:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1240556838.jpg
Drone coalition to gather $1.8 billion by end of 2024, defense minister says	The international drone coalition is planning to gather 1.8 billion euros ($1.8 billion) by the end of 2024 to support Ukraine, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Nov. 25. &quot;This decision will allow Ukraine to strengthen its technological advantage on the battlefield and destroy the enemy more effectively,&quot; Umerov said. An allied initiative, co-headed by the U.K. and Latvia, was launched in January to bolster Ukraine&apos;s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which became a crucial capability on the battlefield. Nearly 20 countries joined the coalition as of late November. Riga will allocate 20 million euros ($21 million) this year for the effort. Umerov did not specify how much money other countries will allocate to the drone coalition. Ukraine is also working to scale up domestic production, aiming to produce at least 1 million drones in 2024. Kyiv employs long-range drones to strike deep into Russian territory, targeting military infrastructure such as airfields and logistics, as well as oil refineries and depots.	https://kyivindependent.com/drone-coalition-to-allocate-1-8-billion-to-ukraine-by-end-of-2024/	2024-11-25T09:07:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2069256477.jpg
Ukraine 'sees existing threats' from Russia in Zaporizhzhia sector, Zelensky says	Ukraine is tracking threats from Russian troops in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 25 following a report by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. &quot;We see the existing threats,&quot; Zelensky said. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, saying Moscow was deploying trained assault groups to front-line positions in mid-November. Russia is also carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, attempting to encircle the latter one. The president described the situation near the town of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast as &quot;the most difficult.&quot; &quot;We are working to strengthen our positions,&quot; he added. According to the president, Ukrainian soldiers also continue to hold positions in Kursk Oblast amid an ongoing nearly four-months-long incursion. Last week, Reuters reported that Kyiv had lost over 40% of captured territory in the Russian region due to Moscow&apos;s counterattacks. To aid Moscow&apos;s war effort, North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in Kursk Oblast. &quot;Our task is to destroy the Russian potential in the border area as much as possible,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-3/	2024-11-25T08:03:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-25_14-22-21.jpg
North Korea expands plant producing missiles used by Russia against Ukraine, Reuters reports	North Korea is expanding a key weapons production complex that assembles KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles used by Russia against Ukraine, Reuters reported on Nov.25, citing researchers at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) and satellite images. Moscow launched around 60 North Korean KN-23 missiles in 2024, CNN reported last week, citing an unnamed Ukrainian defense official. &#xA0;This accounts for nearly one-third of the 194 ballistic missile strikes tracked by Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force. August and September saw a surge in these attacks, with Ukrainian officials publicly identifying the KN-23 as a significant threat. The facility, known as the February 11 plant, is part of the Ryongsong Machine Complex in Hamhung, the second-largest city in North Korea. The plant was the only known manufacturer of KN-23 missiles, said Sam Lair, a research fellow at the CNS. Previously released videos by North Korean state-controlled media showed that the complex produced everything from tank wheels to rocked motor cases, Lair added. According to October satellite images, an additional assembly building is under construction, as well as a new housing facility that may be intended for workers, the think tank&apos;s analysis showed. The new assembly building is about 60 to 70% the size of the previous one where the missiles were assembled, Reuters reported. The researchers also suggested that the entrances to some of the complex&apos;s underground facilities had been improved. Moscow and Pyongyang signed a strategic partnership agreement in June, pledging to provide military support to one another if either country comes under attack. The Russian parliament ratified the defense treaty in October, amid reports that North Korea was sending troops along with weapons to aid Moscow&apos;s war against Ukraine. Pyongyang has sent an estimated 10,000 troops to Russia, many of whom are stationed in embattled Kursk Oblast and are engaged in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a Nov. 12 briefing.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-expands-plant-producing-missiles-used-by-russia-against-ukraine-researchers-tell-reuters/	2024-11-25T07:16:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2166581785.jpg
The Counteroffensive: Ukraine’s nuclear ambitions fueled by betrayal, hindered by feasibility	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This article was published by the twice-weekly newsletter &#x201C;The Counteroffensive with Tim Mak&#x201D; on Nov. 23, 2024, and has been re-published by the Kyiv Independent with permission. To subscribe to The Counteroffensive, click here. For a brief period just over 30 years ago, Ukraine possessed the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world. Its missiles could reach targets more than 10,000 kilometers away in just 25 minutes. But in 1994, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the newly independent country gave up all its nuclear weapons. In return, it signed the Budapest Memorandum alongside the United States, Britain, and Russia, which obligated them to provide security assurances. All illusions were shattered when one of the guarantor countries waged war against Ukraine, first in 2014 and then in a full-scale invasion in 2022. The nuclear threat in Ukraine has been rising. On Nov. 20, Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the country&apos;s legal threshold for a nuclear strike, allowing the possibility of a nuclear response to a conventional attack. Putin made the change after U.S. President Biden authorized Ukraine to use American-made missiles to strike inside Russia. The fundamental issue behind a potential Ukrainian nuclear program is the sense of betrayal: by Russia, for invading, and by the West, for failing to uphold its security assurances. Ukrainian officials continue to assert that the country has no plans to develop nuclear weapons and prefers a peaceful path. However, a recent poll showed that a majority of Ukrainians support the idea of returning to nuclear status. They see it as a means to deter Russia. If Ukraine is excluded from NATO and U.S. military aid, they believe restoring nuclear capabilities could bolster sovereignty independently. Last week, The Times of London speculated that Ukraine could build a basic nuclear bomb within a few months if the Trump administration stopped providing military aid. The spent nuclear fuel stored at Ukrainian power plants could be used to create a weapon similar to the &quot;Fat Man&quot; bomb dropped on Nagasaki during WWII. &quot;Statements about Ukraine&apos;s nuclear capabilities are made either by total ignoramuses or by Russian provocateurs... As a person who worked on this issue continuously in parliament, I can assure you 100% that the Ukrainian government has never raised the issue of using nuclear weapons at any level,&quot; former Ukrainian Minister Yurii Kostenko told The Counteroffensive. Kostenko, the former environment and nuclear safety minister, also led Ukraine&apos;s delegation for nuclear disarmament in the 1990s. After announcing its commitment to nuclear disarmament, Ukraine saw new prospects for its future. In 1992, the U.S. was even prepared to offer NATO membership as a security guarantee. But Moscow had other plans. Under immense Russian pressure, Ukraine didn&#x2019;t destroy its nuclear weapons independently. Instead, it handed them over to the Kremlin for destruction. &quot;From the very first minutes of the negotiation process on Ukraine&apos;s nuclear disarmament, one thing became clear: in the minds of the Russians, the Soviet Union had not collapsed &#x2014; it had merely transformed. Russia, or rather the Kremlin, still saw itself as having the right to control the actions of its former republics, as it had before,&quot; Kostenko recalled. The ex-minister explained that due to the Soviet-era mindset of the Ukrainian government at the time &#x2014; considering Russia as a &#x201C;big brother&#x201D; &#x2014; Kyiv ultimately surrendered over 170 intercontinental missiles, more than 40 strategic bombers, and thousands of nuclear warheads to Russia. It was a fatal mistake. In the 1990s, it was estimated that Ukraine could have restored its nuclear potential in five to seven years. According to Harvard nuclear disarmament expert Mariana Budjeryn, it would take a similar timeframe for Ukraine to rebuild such capabilities now, assuming the war ended and sufficient financial resources were available. However, this is purely theoretical &#x2014; the situation is far more complicated. To develop a nuclear weapon requires two key ingredients: significant financial resources and advanced technology. Today, Ukraine&apos;s economy is largely sustained by foreign aid, and it&#x2019;s clear that Kyiv won&#x2019;t be able to use Western funding to develop nuclear weapons. Finding the necessary funds within its own reserves is also highly unlikely, as other countries typically spend at least a billion dollars annually to maintain their nuclear capabilities. &quot;If you look at the financial capabilities of the Ukrainian state budget, it couldn&apos;t even finance the maintenance of the Ukrainian armed forces&#x2026; even non-nuclear ones,&quot; Kostenko said. U.S. President Bill Clinton (L), Russian President Boris Yeltsin (C), and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk (R) pose for a photo after having signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances.(Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Even if Ukraine could secure the funds to produce nuclear weapons, there remains the technical and engineering challenge. Ukraine has been involved in the production of nuclear weapons in the past. For example, manufacturers based in Ukraine produced one of the first Soviet intercontinental missiles. According to Budjeryn, Kyiv still retains some institutional knowledge of nuclear physics and certain industrial capacities inherited from the Soviet era. But much of this expertise and infrastructure has been lost over time. Ukraine is one of the most nuclear-dependent countries in the world, with nuclear energy accounting for more than half of its electricity production. Currently, there are four nuclear power plants in operation in Ukraine, and another, Chornobyl, has been decommissioned since 1986. Uranium and plutonium can be used to make nuclear fuel. Plutonium almost doesn&#x2019;t exist in nature, and its production requires a special kind of reactor that&#x2019;s not easy to build or conceal. Uranium, on the other hand, is a natural resource, and Ukraine has large reserves of this ore. It was from this material that the first Soviet warheads were produced. However, Ukraine is not a country capable of producing enriched nuclear fuel, even for peaceful purposes. Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine bought nuclear fuel from Russia but has since switched to purchasing it entirely from the United States. And this is far from the highly enriched uranium needed for weapons development. Ukraine is a part of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If it begins producing nuclear fuel for weapons, the IAEA will likely discover it. Ukraine would then need to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The only country to have done so is North Korea. Since then, it has been one of the most sanctioned countries in the world, which has severely impacted its economy. If Ukraine withdrew from the treaty, it could face a similar fate, the former nuclear safety minister believes. &quot;North Korea has been under sanctions for 12 years, Iran is under sanctions, and Ukraine will be under sanctions. The question is who will bring us shells, missiles, especially for air defense, because every day Russia shells peaceful cities,&quot; Kostenko said. To develop nuclear weapons, Ukraine would need specialized infrastructure it currently lacks. Uranium enrichment requires centrifuges &#x2014; machines that spin at incredibly high speeds to separate isotopes. This is a highly complex and costly process, involving thousands of centrifuges, the distribution of which is strictly regulated worldwide. Uranium can be enriched secretly by moving the production process underground, as Iran has been attempting to do for years. But even if Ukraine were to move all its production underground, it&#x2019;s unlikely the development of nuclear weapons could stay secret for long. Both Russian and Western intelligence services are more active than ever in the country. While Russian intelligence seeks to exploit vulnerabilities in Ukraine&#x2019;s defenses, Western agencies are closely monitoring the course of the war. &quot;The Ukrainian military has still managed to keep operations secret in several instances. The surprise in the Kharkiv region during the counteroffensive and in the Kursk region are examples. It is possible to maintain such secrecy for short periods,&quot; said Budjeryn. Even if Ukraine managed to keep its nuclear production secret, nuclear warheads alone are insufficient. Ukraine would need delivery systems to fire the weapons. Typically, nuclear forces consist of three components &#x2014; ballistic missiles, nuclear submarines, and strategic bombers &#x2014; collectively known as the &#x201C;nuclear triad.&#x201D; At present, Ukraine has no submarines in service, and its bombers have been transferred to Russia. This leaves the only viable option: to develop long-range missiles. &quot;A prototype of a short-range ballistic missile has already been developed, but we have yet to see whether there is any mass production of these systems, or how these systems might be used, for example, in a deterrence strategy with conventional or nuclear warheads,&quot; explained Budjeryn. Even if Ukraine developed these systems, it&#x2019;s unclear that nuclear weapons would guarantee peace. The presence of nuclear weapons hasn&#x2019;t always prevented conflict. For instance, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, yet their conflict has persisted for decades, with nuclear warheads failing to act as a deterrent. Kostenko is convinced that developing nuclear weapons, even if feasible, is a futile idea that would lead nowhere, as Ukraine lacks the capacity to compete with Russia&apos;s nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world. &quot;Why do we need nuclear weapons? Even if we were to reach a certain level of production, we would never be able to compete with Russia in terms of nuclear power to protect ourselves from a Russian savage wielding a nuclear club,&quot; the former minister remarked. Ultimately, the idea of a domestic nuclear program is less about policy than a signal to the world. Talk about this issue reflects Ukraine&#x2019;s grief and anger over once having the means to deter war on its land &#x2014; and, after giving it up, being left vulnerable to death and destruction due to promises unkept.

UK targets 30 tankers in its largest sanctions package against Russia's 'shadow fleet'	The United Kingdom sanctioned 30 oil tankers of Russia&apos;s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; that carried billions of dollars worth of oil and oil products last year, the government said on Nov. 25. &quot;Oil revenues are a crucial source of funding for the Kremlin&#x2019;s illegal war in Ukraine,&quot; the Foreign Office said in a statement. The latest sanctions follow Moscow&#x2019;s efforts to evade the West&apos;s attempts to stifle its oil revenues through the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed two years ago. &quot;Constraining these revenues, including by cracking down on the companies that insure these vessels, is vital for maintaining our shared security: degrading the Kremlin&#x2019;s war machine, clearing our shipping lanes of unsafe traffic, and protecting our international trade to make room for growth.&#x201D; the statement added. The sanctions expand the number of U.K.-sanctioned Russian vessels to 73, the biggest batch of sanctioned ships by a single Western country. The EU and U.S. have also targeted Russia&apos;s shadow fleet in previous rounds of sanctions, applying restrictions to individual tankers and shipping services. Russia has invested $10 billion to expand its shadow fleet since 2022, according to the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) Insititute. The fleet consists of old and poorly insured tankers that carried two-thirds of Russia&apos;s seaborne crude oil exports last year, the report showed.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-targets-30-tankers-in-its-largest-sanctions-package-against-russias-shadow-fleet/	2024-11-25T06:15:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1477538300.jpg
Ukraine's top energy company to receive $112 million from EU, US to restore facilities	DTEK, Ukraine&apos;s largest private energy company, will receive $112 million from the EU and the U.S. to restore facilities damaged in Russian attacks and prepare them for winter, the company said on Nov. 25. Russian attacks have destroyed 90% of DTEK&apos;s generation capacity during an aerial campaign in the spring and summer earlier this year, which aimed to knock out Ukraine&apos;s power grid. Moscow&apos;s forces launched another massive attack on Nov. 17, again targeting DTEK&apos;s power plants. The U.S. government is providing $46.1 million to purchase control systems and dozens of new transformers, while the European Commission pledged 62.8 million euros ($66 million) to restore 1.8GW of generating capacity and to protect power plant equipment from elements during the winter. &quot;The work will ensure a stable and reliable energy supply to more than 2 million Ukrainians,&quot; the company said in a press release. &quot;The United States is proud to support Ukraine&apos;s energy resilience with this critical aid package,&quot; said Geoffrey Pyatt, the assistant secretary of state for energy resources. &quot;By providing $46.1 million for control systems and new transformers, we are helping to rebuild and fortify Ukraine&apos;s energy infrastructure against Russia&#x2019;s unprovoked attacks.&quot; DTEK&apos;s CEO, Maksym Timchenko, said the company is &quot;deeply grateful for the unwavering support of the United States and the European Commission, and the leadership of the Ministry of Energy in delivering this vital aid.&quot; In turn, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), one of Ukraine&apos;s largest institutional investors, said it would not provide funds to DTEK due to its ownership by oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. &quot;The objective of freeing the economy from the influence of oligarchs is absolutely fundamental,&quot; EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso said, according to the Italian publication Corriere della Sera. Akhmetov is Ukraine&apos;s wealthiest man, with vast holdings in mining and metallurgy. Formerly a lawmaker of the pro-Russian Party of Regions, the business tycoon saw a large part of his assets lost during Russia&apos;s invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/dtek-112-million-from-us-eu/	2024-11-25T05:53:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2147953041.jpeg
5 injured by Russian drone during humanitarian aid distribution in Mykolaiv Oblast	A Russian drone attacked the village of Solonchaky in Mykolaiv Oblast while humanitarian aid was being distributed there on Nov. 25, Governor Vitalii Kim reported. Five people were injured, with both aid workers and residents among the victims. All of them were taken to hospital, and two are in serious condition, the governor wrote on his Telegram channel. The attack comes five days after Russian forces struck another humanitarian aid distribution point in Novodmytrivka in Kherson Oblast, reportedly targeting a building where volunteers were distributing bread to residents. A projectile struck the roof, damaging windows, the facade, and the roof itself. No injuries were reported in that case. Earlier today, Russian forces also struck houses in central Kharkiv, injuring 23, and also struck downtown Odesa, wounding 11, local authorities reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/5-injured-by-russian-drone-in-mykolaiv-oblast/	2024-11-25T05:11:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1489471985--1-.jpg
Trump's reelection revives talks in Europe on sending military personnel to Ukraine, Le Monde reports	Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election revived discussion among European allies on sending military personnel or private defense contractors to Ukraine, Le Monde reported on Nov. 25, citing undisclosed sources. The topic was reportedly brought up during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer&apos;s visit to France on Nov. 11, as London and Paris do not rule out taking the lead in the pro-Kyiv coalition, the outlet writes. There are fears that Trump&apos;s victory might lead to the U.S. withdrawing its support for Ukraine, leaving it up to European allies to help Kyiv resist Russian aggression. French President Emmanuel Macron previously suggested deploying military trainers to Ukraine, but the idea has met strong opposition among several key allies, namely Germany. According to Le Monde, discussions on the deployment of Western troops are still ongoing, but the details remain classified. One proposal reportedly involved allowing the Defense Conseil International (DCI), a 55%-state-held defense contractor, to help train Ukrainian troops directly in Ukraine, as it already does in Poland and France. Talking to the media on Nov. 23, France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the West should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support. When asked by the BBC whether sending French troops would constitute a so-called red line, Barrot said that France would &quot;not discard any option.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-talks-on-troop-in-ukraine/	2024-11-25T04:55:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184127273.jpg
Opinion: Nuclear escalation fears can't override Ukraine's right to defend itself	Following Donald Trump&#x2019;s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, publicly appealed to those who had voted for both her and Trump. She wanted to know what motivated such an apparently inconsistent choice, and the predominant answer she heard was that she and Trump seemed more sincere, whereas Vice President Kamala Harris came off as too calculating. It was a fruitful exercise, and we can ask the same of leftists who support both the Palestinians and Russia. After all, the latter has been bombing Ukrainian cities until they resemble Gaza, and just as the right-wing parties in Israel&#x2019;s government want to create a Greater Israel, the Kremlin hopes to create a Greater Russia. Russia&#x2019;s eliminationist project should thus remain top of mind whenever we assess developments on the ground. Immediately after the recent decision by U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration to allow Ukraine to launch U.S.-furnished ATACMS missiles (with a range of up to 190 miles, or 305.8 kilometers) into Russia, the Kremlin warned that any use of Western arms against the Russian Federation could trigger a nuclear response under its new nuclear doctrine. Nonetheless, the Ukrainians countered by firing six ATACMS missiles at a military facility in the Bryansk region (adjacent to the Ukrainian border) the next day. Although Russia claims that the damage was negligible &#x2014; five of the missiles were shot down, and there were no casualties &#x2014; following the letter of its new nuclear doctrine would mean that it is now at war with the United States and has the right to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. With some of those around Trump already accusing Biden of taking a dangerous step toward a new world war, is it fair to say that Ukraine went too far? Has it disturbed the fragile balance that kept the conflict limited? Before jumping to this conclusion, one must remember that the U.S. has permitted Ukraine to target locations primarily in Kursk, the border region from which Russia has been launching many of its attacks against Ukrainian positions. As Josep Borrell, the (outgoing) EU foreign-policy chief put it: &#x201C;Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provided to them not only to stop the arrow, but also to be able to hit the archers.&#x201D; Moreover, recall that Russia had escalated its own campaign against Ukraine mere days earlier, blanketing the entire country with drone and missile attacks against civilian energy infrastructure just before the onset of winter. While six Ukrainian missiles caused panic all around the world, Russia&#x2019;s systematic destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure has been normalized &#x2014; much like Israel&#x2019;s razing of northern Gaza.

(Libkos/Getty Images)The situation is as obscene as it is absurd. Russia, having launched a war of conquest against its peaceful neighbor, now wants to keep its own territory out of the war, and it accuses Ukraine, the victim, of &#x201C;expanding&#x201D; the conflict. If Russia is serious about its new nuclear doctrine, let us offer an equally serious counter-doctrine: If an independent country is attacked with non-nuclear forces by a nuclear superpower, its allies have the right &#x2014; even the duty &#x2014; to provide it with nuclear weapons so that it has a chance of deterring an attack. It is often said that Putin wants a return to the Soviet Union and Stalinism; but this is not right. Rather, his regime is sustained by a vision of the pre-1917 imperial era, when czarist Russia&#x2019;s zone of influence encompassed not only Poland but also Finland. Time will tell if Putin&#x2019;s neo-Czarism is more than a pipe dream. In the emerging multipolar world, the rise of strong empires, each with its own zone of influence, is quite conceivable. As Putin told the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June 2022, &#x201C;sovereignty cannot be segmented or fragmented in the 21st century.&#x201D; Upholding political sovereignty and national identity is essential, he said, but so is strengthening everything that &#x201C;determines our country&#x2019;s economic, financial, professional, and technological independence.&#x201D; Clearly, only a new imperial Russia, not Ukraine or Belarus or Finland, will be able to enjoy the full benefits of sovereignty. Making matters worse, on the same day that President Vladimir Putin announced the new Russian nuclear doctrine, the BBC reported that, &#x201C;air pollution in India&#x2019;s capital Delhi has soared to extremely severe levels, choking residents and engulfing the city in thick smog,&#x201D; disrupting air transport, forcing schools to close, and halting construction. &#x201C;And experts warn that the situation could get worse in Delhi in the coming days.&#x201D; While Russia indulges in imperial aggression and rattles its nuclear saber, hundreds of millions of people are finding it harder to breathe. Our media trumpet the use of Western weapons against Russia as front-page &#x201C;breaking news,&#x201D; and our blinkered leftists regard Ukraine&#x2019;s &#x201C;excessive&#x201D; defense as a dangerous escalation. A threat to our very survival, however, barely merits mention. Editor&#x2019;s Note: Copyright, Project Syndicate.

MP walks back his statement on number of IDPs returning to occupied territories	Ukrainian lawmaker Maksym Tkachenko said that his earlier statement about 150,000 internally displaced persons (IDP) returning to occupied territories was only his assumption, not based on real data, Ukrinform reported on Nov. 25. &quot;There is no such data. This was my unfounded and emotional assumption,&quot; Tkachenko told Ukrinform. &quot;I spoke incorrectly, so I&apos;m taking back my words,&quot; said the lawmaker who serves on a committee focused on human rights and the liberation of occupied territories. Tkachenko previously said during an interview with Ukrinform published on Nov. 24 that 150,000 IDPs have already returned to Russian-occupied territories, including 70,000 who have come back to the southern city of Mariupol. Tkachenko now explained that individual IDPs are forced to travel to occupied territories for various reasons, but &quot;it is by no means about hundreds or even tens of thousands, and general verified statistics cannot even theoretically exist.&quot; An estimated 3.7 million IDPs live in Ukraine as Russian aggression and occupation have driven them out of their homes. Many of them face difficulties securing housing and employment. The problem of mass displacement in Ukraine continues to grow as Russia&apos;s ongoing advance in the east leads to more civilian evacuations. Russia now occupies around 20% of Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/tkachenko-idps/	2024-11-25T04:20:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1239378487.jpg
You're repeating Russian propaganda,' Ukrainian boxing champion Klitschko responds to Joe Rogan	Ukrainian former professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko on Nov. 24 accused Joe Rogan of echoing Russian propaganda after the U.S. podcaster lambasted Washington&apos;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia. &quot;You talk about sending American weapons to Ukraine, which you believe will lead to World War III. (Vladimir) Putin&#x2019;s Russia is in trouble, so Putin wants to scare you and people like you. His war was supposed to last three days. It lasted three years thanks to the heroism and sacrifice of Ukrainians,&quot; Klitschko said in the video. Rogan, one of the most popular podcasters in the U.S. with over 18 million followers on YouTube, criticized the outgoing Biden administration for allowing Ukraine to strike with Storm Shadow and ATACMS missiles deep into Russian territory earlier this month. The podcaster voiced fears that the decision could lead to World War III. &quot;How are you allowed to do that when you are on your way out. Like people don&#x2019;t want you to be there anymore, maybe that would be a good thing we would like to avoid from a dying former president. The whole thing is nuts,&quot; Rogan said in a recent episode. During the electoral campaign, Rogan endorsed Donald Trump, who has criticized military aid to Ukraine and said he would bring both sides to the negotiating table. The Biden administration has sought to speed up military support for Kyiv before Trump takes office in January. &quot;Zelensky says Putin is terrified. Fuck you, man. You fucking people are about to start World War III,&quot; Rogan said. In his video, Klitschko asked for an invitation to Rogan&#x2019;s podcast to counter his views on Ukraine and Russia. &quot;If you invite me to your podcasts, we could discuss (our misunderstandings) like free men,&quot; Klitschko said at the end of the video.	https://kyivindependent.com/joe-rogan-klitschko/	2024-11-25T03:43:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2008030057.jpg
Ukraine's 3rd Brigade says it cleared out Kharkiv Oblast village, took ex-convict POWs	Ukraine&#x2019;s Third Assault Brigade said on Nov. 25 that it had cleared out Russian troops from the Kopanky village in Kharkiv Oblast, taking several prisoners of war (POW) from Russia&#x2019;s First Tank Army. Russian forces were reportedly pushed out after they attempted to break into Kopanky, a village in eastern Kharkiv Oblast close to the administrative border with Luhansk Oblast. The settlement lies around 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Kupiansk, a key logistics hub under increasing pressure from Russian troops. In a video published by the unit, seven POWs are seen in a basement-like room during a filmed interrogation. According to the unit, the POWs&apos; positions came under artillery fire from the Russian military after their capture. Russia has been recruiting prisoners for high-risk assault operations in Ukraine to offset its staggering losses during the full-scale war. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the unit&#x2019;s claims or where the video was recorded. The Third Separate Assault Brigade is known to have been operating around the village of Borova in Kharkiv Oblast. They launched a successful counterattack in the region in August, advancing almost 2 square kilometers deep into the front line area.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-3rd-brigade-kopanky/	2024-11-25T03:12:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1244040441.jpg
Russian attacks in Ukraine injure 5 over past day, including 13-year-old boy	Russian attacks across Ukraine injured at least five civilians, including a 13-year-old boy, over the past day, regional authorities reported on the morning of Nov. 25. A Russian attack against the Koriukivka district of Chernihiv Oblast on Nov. 24 injured a 28-year-old man, according to Governor Viacheslav Chaus. Three people were injured during Russian attacks on Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Three high-rise buildings and 22 houses were damaged. A Russian drone attack against the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight on Nov. 25 injured a 13-year-old boy, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. Industrial facilities in the city were attacked. Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Poltava, Zhytomyr, and Odesa oblasts were also attacked, but no casualties were reported. Russia continued to attack Ukraine later during the day on Nov. 25, hitting the cities of Kharkiv and Odesa with missiles and inflicting additional casualties. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 71 of the 145 Russian drones launched overnight, the Air Force said. Seventy-one other drones were &quot;lost&quot; across Ukraine, likely thanks to electronic warfare means, the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-106/	2024-11-25T02:46:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Donetsk-Oblast-Nov-25.jpg
UK national reportedly captured by Russia while fighting for Ukraine	A British national fighting for Ukraine has been captured by Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, according to multiple reports from Nov. 24. A video of a man in military fatigues, who identifies himself as former British army signalman James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, began circulating on Russian Telegram channels on Nov. 24. In the video, the man &#x2013;&#xA0;who spoke with an English accent &#x2013; says he signed up for Ukraine&apos;s International Legion, a unit made up of foreign volunteers, after serving in the British military from 2019 to 2023. When the footage was taken remains unclear, and its authenticity could not be independently verified. The man cannot speak freely as he was recorded while captured and apparently in the presence of Russian soldiers. The Russian state news agency TASS quoted a military source claiming that a &quot;U.K. mercenary&quot; has been detained in Kursk Oblast, an embattled region on the border with Ukraine. Russia often presents foreign volunteers fighting for Ukraine as &quot;mercenaries&quot; and claims they are not entitled to protection as prisoners of war. The U.K. Foreign Office told the media it was &quot;supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention.&quot; Scott Anderson, the 22-year-old&apos;s father, told the Daily Mail that he &quot;was in complete shock and in tears&quot; when the fighter&apos;s commander sent him the video. &quot;I could see straight away it was him. He looks frightened, scared, and worried,&quot; Scott Anderson said. Two other Britons, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, were captured by Russian forces in Mariupol in 2022 and sentenced to death before being released in a prisoner exchange. Russia has ramped up pressure in Kursk Oblast to dislodge Ukrainian troops holding positions there since early August. Reuters reported on Nov. 23 that Ukraine had lost over 40% of territory previously captured during the incursion.	https://kyivindependent.com/british-man-reportedly-captured/	2024-11-25T01:57:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2168599470.jpg

Ukrainian drones hit oil depot in western Russia's Kaluga Oblast, source says	Drones operated by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) hit an oil depot in the western Russian city of Kaluga, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 25. The Kaluganefteprodukt oil facility, which is used to support Russian aggression in Ukraine, was struck by the drones at 0:30 a.m. on Nov. 25, leading to a series of blasts and a fire, the source claimed. Kaluga, a city of roughly 340,000 people, lies approximately 290 kilometers (180 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. Videos shared on local Telegram channels show a fire and active air defenses in the city. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show active air defense during a drone attack in Kaluga, Kaluga Oblast, Russia, overnight on Nov. 25, 2024. (HUR source)Kaluga Oblast Governor Vladislav Shapsha claimed that eight drones were shot down overnight, resulting in a fire at an industrial facility that was later extinguished. The official did not provide further details on possible damage and said there had been no casualties. According to Andrii Kovalenko, the counter-disinformation chief at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, drones also targeted Kaluga&apos;s Taifun (Typhoon) factory, which produces radio-electronic equipment, missile and aviation components, and other military supplies. It remains unclear whether the Taifun factory suffered damage, as the target was not mentioned by the HUR source. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/kaluga-oil-depot/	2024-11-25T00:39:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Kaluga.png
Cargo plane crashes in Lithuania, leaving one dead	A DHL cargo plane flying from Leipzig in Germany crashed near the Vilnius Airport in Lithuania on the morning of Nov. 25, leaving one crew member dead and two injured, local media reported. The plane crashed a few kilometers south of the runway and hit a house, catching on fire. Three remaining people on board survived the crash, and 12 people were evacuated from the damaged house, according to authorities. The Boeing 737-476(SF) plane, operated by a DHL contractor Swiftair, crashed at about 5.30 a.m. local time south of the capital, officials said. Lithuanian authorities said it was too early to draw conclusions about the cause of the crash and that an investigation was underway. Two shipments from Lithuania to Leipzig caught fire earlier this year, with officials reportedly suspecting Moscow of a plot that saw several parcels sent by individuals to catch fire in Germany and the U.K. in July 2024. This could have led the cargo planes to crash if the fires happened during the flight.	https://kyivindependent.com/cargo-plane-crashes-in-vilnius/	2024-11-24T23:31:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Vilnius-Airport.jpg
Far-right Ukraine aid critic takes surprise lead in Romanian presidential election	Calin Georgescu, a far-right critic of Romania&apos;s pro-NATO and pro-Ukraine policy, is projected to enter the presidential run-off vote after a shock result in the first round on Nov. 24. Georgescu is leading the polls with 22.92% and roughly 99.9% of the vote counted, followed by center-left Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu at 19.17% and Elena Lasconi of the center-right Save Romania Union at 19.16%. The surprise outcome signals a possible shift within a country at NATO&apos;s eastern frontier that has been staunchly supportive of its Ukrainian neighbors throughout the full-scale war. Romania&apos;s head of state has a significant influence in some areas, such as foreign policy. George Simion, the leader of the far-right AUR Alliance, who has been banned from entering Ukraine over &quot;systematic anti-Ukrainian activities,&quot; is projected to come in fourth with 13.87%. The second round of the vote is scheduled to take place on Dec. 8. Georgescu has previously called for an end to Romania&apos;s support for Ukraine and lambasted the presence of a NATO missile defense station in Romania as a &quot;shame on diplomacy.&quot; Romania took a decisively pro-Ukraine stance under Ciolacu and outgoing President Klaus Iohannis, providing military, humanitarian, and economic support. The country is a key conduit for Ukraine&apos;s agricultural exports and has recently provided Ukraine with a Patriot air defense system. Romania shares a 610-kilometer (380-mile) border with Ukraine. Russian drone wreckage has been found on the Romanian side of the border on several occasions following Moscow&apos;s drone strikes against Ukrainian Danube ports, forcing Bucharest to ramp up security measures in the area. Georgescu, who has a strong presence on the TikTok social network, was considered to be a marginal candidate by previous surveys and was often not even listed among the top five presidential hopefuls. He ran as an independent candidate while a former member of the AUR Alliance. Georgescu left the party in 2022 after being criticized by his fellow party members for his overtly pro-Russian and anti-NATO views. He previously lauded Romania&apos;s World War II-era fascist leader, Ion Antonescu, as a national hero. Georgescu served as a special rapporteur in the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and has worked as an expert in sustainable development and the environment sector.	https://kyivindependent.com/romania-elections/	2024-11-24T23:02:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Picture1.png

Polish farmers lift blockade at Ukraine border	Polish farmers, who staged a protest in the village of Medyka and blocked the Sheghini border crossing with Ukraine, have suspended their blockade, Ukraine&#x2019;s State Customs Service reported on Nov. 24. The protest lasted for just over one day, starting on Nov. 23. The decision followed a meeting with Polish Minister of Agriculture Czeslaw Siekierski, during which farmers agreed to submit their demands by Nov. 26, with the minister promising a response by December 10. The blockade had restricted truck traffic from Ukraine, with only one truck per hour permitted from Poland to Ukraine. However, vehicles like buses, cars, humanitarian aid, and military convoys were allowed through. Farmers were protesting the Polish government&apos;s failure to maintain the agricultural tax rate in 2024 at the same level as in 2023, according to RMF24. They were also reportedly protesting over concerns about the European Union signing a free trade agreement with South American countries in the Mercosur bloc. &#x201C;We want to put pressure on the government to prevent this agreement from being reached,&#x201D; said Roman Kondrov, a protest organizer. As of November 24, truck traffic at the crossing has been fully restored, according to Ukraine&apos;s State Customs Service. Polish farmers have staged multiple protests at border crossings between Poland and Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, including protests against Ukrainian agricultural imports in the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-farmers-lift-blockade-at-ukraine-border/	2024-11-24T20:46:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2025718523--1-.jpg
Putin signs law prohibiting adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries that permit gender transition	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender transitioning is legal, the Russian government&#x2019;s legal information website published on Nov. 23. The law targeted at least 15 countries, including several in Europe, as well as Australia, Argentina, and Canada. Additional legislation approved on the same day prohibits promoting child-free lifestyles and imposes fines of up to 5 million rubles (about $50,000) for spreading such messages, framed as part of a Western agenda to weaken Russia. These moves align with Russia&apos;s broader recent push for &quot;traditional values,&quot; highlighted by past laws banning gender-transition procedures, LGBTQ+ information, and declaring LGBTQ+ activism as &#x2018;extremist.&#x2019; Putin has increasingly criticized Western liberal ideologies, describing them as a threat to Russia. The crackdown on dissent, activists, and independent media in Russia has escalated, especially since the war in Ukraine began in 2022. In November 2023, Russian Supreme Court&apos;s decision to label the &quot;international LGBT movement&quot; as &quot;extremist,&quot; has starkly intensified the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in general within the country.

Ukraine developing guided aerial bombs domestically, Chief of Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff says	Ukraine is actively working on developing its own guided aerial bombs, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Anatolii Barhylevych reported on Nov. 24. &quot;We are actively working on it. I think we will achieve such success,&quot; he said during a telethon on the air of Yedyni Novyny. Barhylevych pointed out that Russia holds the largest stockpile of aerial bombs inherited from the Soviet Union. Guided aerial bombs are precision-guided munitions that have a shorter range than missiles but are far cheaper to produce. When launched from aircraft within Russian territory or Russian-occupied territories, they are beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defense. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Oct. 21 that Ukraine has invested more than $4 billion in its defense production and urged international partners to invest further, recalling the recent successes of Ukrainian specialists in drone manufacturing.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-developing-guided-aerial-bombs-domestically-chief-of-ukrainian-armed-forces-general-staff-says/	2024-11-24T17:12:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1243505779.jpg
Lithuania delivers new military aid package to Ukraine	Lithuania has delivered another military aid package to Ukraine, Lithuania&#x2019;s Ministry of National Defense reported on Nov. 24. The aid package included generators, M113 spare parts, weapons, and ammunition, according to the ministry&apos;s post on X. &#x201C;Lithuania continues its unwavering support for Ukraine,&#x201D; the ministry said. &#x201C;Whatever it takes for Ukraine to win. Solidarity remains steadfast.&#x201D; Additionally, on November 23, the defense ministers of both countries signed a memorandum in Vilnius to establish a mechanism for supporting Ukraine&#x2019;s security. The agreement includes Lithuanian funding for the production of Ukrainian long-range drones. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and his Lithuanian counterpart also reportedly discussed plans to equip Ukrainian brigades, provide ammunition, strengthen air defense, and expand defense industry cooperation between the two countries as &quot;key priorities&quot; for 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-delivers-new-military-aid-package-to-ukraine/	2024-11-24T15:18:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/Zelensky-in-Lithuania.jpeg
UK businessman faces no charges after admitting to violating Russia sanctions	U.K. businessman David Crisp will not face criminal charges after he was caught on camera admitting to selling luxury perfume in Russia despite government sanctions, the BBC reported on Nov. 24. Crisp was arrested in 2023 by the U.K. agency responsible for sanctions enforcement, but the investigation was dropped earlier in 2024. There have been no criminal convictions in the U.K. for violating sanctions against Russia since the launch of the full-scale invasion, according to the BBC. A private investigator filmed Crisp confessing that he knowingly ignored trade sanctions in order to sell high-end perfume in Russia. The video, previously only shown in court, was obtained by the BBC. The investigator, posing as a Las Vegas businessman, asked Crisp about his dealings in Russia during a conversation in Dallas in July 2023. &quot;Don&apos;t tell anyone,&quot; Crisp said. &quot;We&apos;re doing really well. ... We ignore government edicts. They said we shouldn&apos;t, weren&apos;t allowed to trade there.&quot; Crisp told the agent that sales in Russia in 2023 were the same as in previous years, but that getting products to Russia &#x2014; including bottles of perfume worth over $1,200 &#x2014; was becoming increasingly challenging. The U.K. imposed sanctions against Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The restricitions specifically include bans on luxury perfume products. Crisp&apos;s former business partner, David Garofalo, hired the undercover investigator after he became suspicious that Crisp was continuing to sell to Russian customers in violation of sanctions. Garofolo described Crisp&apos;s statements in the video as &quot;sickening.&quot; &quot;He had actually gone out of his way to disguise the fact that he&#x2019;d continued selling to Russia,&quot; Garofalo told the BBC. &quot;He had deceived our in-house lawyer and misled our auditors.&quot; After Crisp&apos;s arrest, Garofolo took over full control of the company and halted all sales to Russia. Despite the evidence against Crisp, which also included company paperwork and international shipping data, the investigation against him was dropped in July 2024. The U.K.&apos;s HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) agency said it would take no further action against Crisp. Crisp is alleged to have hidden over $2.1 million in illegal sales to Russia. U.K. lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith criticized the government&apos;s track record on sanctions enforcement. &quot;In terms of prosecution and seriously pursuing people over sanctions, the U.K. is very poor indeed,&quot; Smith said. &quot;If we don&apos;t prosecute, who the hell is deterred from breaching sanctions?&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-businessman-faces-no-charges-after-admitting-to-violating-russia-sanctions/	2024-11-24T13:33:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-502473916.jpg
Russia preparing to break through to southern Donetsk Oblast, military says	Russian forces are preparing to break through to the southern part of Donetsk Oblast, Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, said on Nov. 24. Kyiv has been warning of a potential Russian offensive in the south, as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s eastern regions. &quot;The enemy is trying to break through to the south of Donetsk region, where Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts meet,&quot; Voloshyn told Apostrophe TV. Voloshyn said the push would likely concentrate around Velyka Novosilka, one of the largest settlements in the area. Russian troops are also gearing up for assault operations in the direction of Orikhiv and Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. &quot;There is a high probability that the enemy will also launch assault operations, trying to break into our defense,&quot; he said. Russian forces are creating assault groups, transferring ammunition, and conducting aerial reconnaissance with drones, Voloshyn said, citing Ukrainian intelligence. These actions signal preparations for an upcoming offensive. &quot;In addition, the enemy is actively trying to hit the previously scouted areas in these areas... and is finding out where our firepower is located, trying to suppress and destroy it to make it easier for them to conduct assault operations,&quot; he said. Ukrainian forces have been preparing for a Russian push in the south. Voloshyn on Nov. 12 said that Russia could launch a renewed assault on Zaporizhzhia Oblast &quot;any day.&quot; Ukraine is busy building heavy fortifications near Zaporizhzhia, the military told the Economist on Nov. 24. Earlier in October, Voloshyn said that Russian forces were massing for a breakthrough in the direction of Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The area was the main axis of Ukraine&apos;s southern counteroffensive in 2023, which led to the liberation of the settlement of Robotyne but achieved no major results. Russia is currently gaining territory in eastern Ukraine at a rapid rate, seizing towns in Donetsk Oblast at the cost of heavy personnel losses. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 2. that Ukraine is now facing &quot;one of the most powerful&quot; Russian offensives since the start of the all-out war.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-preparing-to-break-through-to-southern-donetsk-oblast-military-says/	2024-11-24T12:36:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1997061526.jpg
Air defense systems can counter Russia's Oreshnik missile, Zelensky says	There are already air defense systems that can successfully take down missiles like the &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; Russia&apos;s new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Nov. 24. Russia first launched the weapon in an attack against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Shortly thereafter, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that &quot;there are currently no ways of countering this weapon.&quot; Zelensky contradicted Putin&apos;s claim on Nov. 24, saying experts were currently analyzing the wreckage of the missile and working with allies to put together a suitable response. &quot;The world has air defense systems capable of countering such threats,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Everyone must focus on this. Russia must feel that every step it takes to expand the war has consequences for it.&quot; Ukraine is working with international partners &quot;to find a response together to this latest Russian escalation,&quot; he said. Since Putin&apos;s announcement unveiling the Oreshnik missile, experts have called into question his claims regarding the weapon&apos;s novelty. Analysts, including Pentagon officials, have said the missile appears to be based heavily on Russia&apos;s RS-26 Rubezh IRBM. In the wake of the Dnipro strike, Zelensky on Nov. 22 directed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with international partners on acquiring advanced air defense systems. Russia&apos;s IRBM attack followed Kyiv&apos;s first reported strike first successful strike on a military target on Russian soil using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The Kremlin previously threatened to &quot;respond accordingly&quot; to long-range strikes with American weapons. Zelensky said on Nov. 24 it was crucial for allies to respond swiftly and increase pressure on Russia. &quot;Putin cannot be given a single week to adapt or find countermeasures,&quot; he said. &quot;We must consistently do everything to force Russia into seeking peace &#x2014; true peace.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/air-defense-systems-can-counter-russias-oreshnik-missile-zelensky-says/	2024-11-24T11:27:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389.jpg
Trump's top security pick calls for end to escalation in Ukraine	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Nov. 24 that escalation between Russia and Ukraine must come to a &quot;responsible end.&quot; Waltz, like Trump, has expressed skepticism about ongoing U.S. military aid to Ukraine amid Russia&apos;s full-scale war. As national security adviser, he will play a key role in Trump&apos;s stated plan to bring about a negotiated end to the war. &quot;The President-elect has been very concerned about the escalation and where it&apos;s all going. ... We need to bring this to a responsible end,&quot; Waltz said in an interview with Fox News on Nov. 24. &quot;We need to restore deterrence, restore peace, and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it.&quot; Waltz&apos;s comments come as outgoing President Joe Biden looks for ways to shore up support for Ukraine ahead of Trump&apos;s inauguration. In recent days, the Biden administration has made a series of decisions aimed at giving Kyiv leverage in future negotiations. These steps including approving the delivery of anti-personnel mines and granting permission for Ukraine to launch U.S.-made long-range ATACMS at targets within Russia. Waltz criticized Biden&apos;s decision to send anti-personnel mines, comparing it to &quot;World War I trench warfare.&quot; Despite this criticism, Waltz said he and his transition team were collaborating with the current administration and that he had met with current U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. &quot;Jake Sullivan and I have had discussions, we&apos;ve met,&quot; Waltz said. &quot;For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity, that they can play one administration off the other &#x2014; they are wrong.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-top-security-pick-calls-for-end-to-escalation-in-ukraine/	2024-11-24T10:44:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2173993733.jpg
Russia’s ballistic missile test and Musk’s mockery of Zelensky | Ukraine This Week	In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s Anna Belokur reports on Russia&#x2019;s recent missile strike using a new ballistic weapon. Meanwhile, Twitter owner and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk throws an online jab at President Volodymyr Zelensky.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-ballistic-missile-test-and-musks-mockery-of-zelensky-ukraine-this-week/	2024-11-24T10:07:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_9958.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine has lost over 40% of territory previously gained in Kursk incursion, Reuters reports	Key developments on Nov. 23-24: Ukraine has lost over 40 percent of the territory it previously gained in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks, Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing a source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. &quot;At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres, now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,&quot; the source told Reuters. &quot;Now we control approximately 800 square kilometres. We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.&quot; Ukraine first gained a foothold in Kursk Oblast during a surprise incursion into the Russian region in early August. Since then, Russia has launched extensive counterattacks in an effort to take back the region. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration on Jan. 20, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations, The Telegraph reported. The source added that nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has previously said that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers have joined the counteroffensive in Kursk, with the General Staff source noting that the majority of North Korean soldiers was finalizing training along Russian forces. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify the information provided by the General Staff source. As Russia&apos;s attempt to take back Kursk continues to progress, Russia has also intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. Western allies should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support against Russian aggression, France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the BBC in an excerpt of an interview published on Nov. 23 . The comments come just days after U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S.-supplied long-range missile to strike targets within Russia, many months after President Volodymyr Zelensky first made the request. Barrot stated that Ukraine could use French-supplied long-range missiles &quot;in the logics of self defense&quot; to strike targets within Russia, but did not elaborate as to whether Kyiv has already used the French-provided weapons. &quot;(France) will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary,&quot; Barrot said. &quot;Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometer, the threat gets one square kilometer closer to Europe.&quot; During the interview Barrot also hinted France may eventually invite Ukraine to join NATO as part of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;We are open to extending an invitation, and so in our discussions with friends and allies, and friends and allies of Ukraine, we are working to get them to closer to our positions,&quot; he said. Days before Biden granted approval to use ATACMS in Russia, the leaders of France and the U.K. met in Paris on Nov. 11 to discuss a last-ditch attempt to persuade the U.S. to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with Western weapons before Donald Trump enters the White House in January. Over the past week, Russia has launched over 800 KAB-guided aerial bombs, nearly 460 attack drones, and more than 20 missiles, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 24. &quot;The air raid siren has sounded almost daily across Ukraine this week. Only last night, our air defense forces managed to shoot down about 50 attack drones,&quot; Zelensky wrote on Telegram, sharing a video showing Russian attacks across the country. On the morning of Nov. 21, Russia unveiled a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), dubbed &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack targeting the city of Dnipro in eastern Ukraine. &quot;Ukraine is not a testing ground for weapons. Ukraine is a sovereign, independent state. Yet Russia persists in its attempts to destroy our people, spread fear and panic, and weaken us,&quot; Zelensky said. He also reiterated the urgent need for bolstered air defenses. &quot;Ukraine needs more air defense systems, and we are working on this with our partners. It is crucial to strengthen the protection of our sky,&quot; he said. On Nov. 22, Zelensky instructed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with international allies to acquire advanced air defense capabilities. The IRBM attack followed Ukraine&#x2019;s reported first successful strike on a military target within Russian territory using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. Unlike cruise missiles, IRBMs are guided only in the initial phase of launch, making them less precise. However, their exceptional speed &#x2014; often exceeding 3,200 kilometers per hour as they near their targets &#x2014; makes them a formidable threat. Russia has recruited hundreds of mercenaries from Yemen to fight in its war against Ukraine, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Nov. 24. The recruits told the FT they had been promised lucrative jobs, &quot;high salaries,&quot; and even Russian citizenship. However, after arriving in Russia with the help of a Houthi-linked company, they were &quot;forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to the front lines in Ukraine,&quot; according to the report. The FT described the operation as a &quot;shadowy trafficking operation,&quot; underscoring the deepening ties between the Kremlin and Yemen&apos;s Iran-backed Houthi militants. Since the start of its full-scale invasion, Moscow has relied on various methods to enlist migrants and foreign nationals to offset its heavy battlefield losses while avoiding full-scale mobilization. Reports indicate that Russia has recruited individuals from Nepal, Somalia, India, Cuba, and other nations. North Korea has also sent an estimated 10,000 troops to Russia, many of whom are stationed in the western Kursk Oblast and engaged in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a Nov. 12 briefing. In October, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) revealed that Yemen&apos;s Houthi militants have been using Russian satellite data to target ships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles. The targeting information was reportedly provided through Iran&apos;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, enabling the Houthis to expand their strikes. This collaboration demonstrates how far Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to go to destabilize the Western political and economic order, the WSJ reported. Analysts suggest that Moscow aims to foment unrest from the Middle East to Asia to distract the United States. According to the FT, U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking confirmed that Russia is &quot;actively pursuing contacts&quot; with the Houthis, including discussions involving weapons transfers. While Lenderking declined to elaborate, he noted that Russian personnel in Sana&apos;a are facilitating this dialogue. &quot;The kinds of weapons being discussed are very alarming and would enable the Houthis to better target ships in the Red Sea and potentially beyond,&quot; Lenderking told the FT.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-has-lost-over-40-of-territory-previously-gained-in-kursk-incursion-reuters-reports/	2024-11-24T09:39:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166312696.jpg
The Week Ahead: Key Developments Impacting Global Politics & Markets	Editor&apos;s note: This article is a shortened on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Nov. 24-Nov. 30. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday.It is Thanksgiving next week. Expect significant disruptions to the business and political cycles. Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, is expected to travel to the US, aiming to meet with Trump and present an updated victory plan. We believe President-elect Donald Trump has challenged Zelensky&#x2019;s initial victory plan. Expect Yermak&#x2019;s overtures to include proposals on lend-lease terms for further military supplies, on business cooperation and mineral rights for American companies (incl. various sweeteners directed specifically at Elon Musk), and on using Ukrainian troops to replace US forces across Europe. In Romania, the first round of presidential elections, on Nov. 24, is expected to be close. Former far-right football hooligan and founder of the populist Alliance of the Union of Romanians George Simion has surged in the polls to almost 19%. While front-runner Social Democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is expected to comfortably win the first round, splitting of the center-right vote between rival candidates could allow Simion to make it to the final runoff. Montreal&#x2019;s NATO Parliamentary Session ends on Monday, Nov. 25 amidst growing fears of Russian hybrid warfare across Europe. Expect the recent sabotage of key communications cables in the Baltic and Trump&#x2019;s post-inauguration plans to be top of the agenda.

150,000 Ukrainian IDPs have returned to occupied regions, MP says	About 150,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have already returned to Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, lawmaker Maksym Tkachenko said in an interview with the news outlet Ukrinform published Nov. 24. There are nearly 5 million IDPs currently registered in Ukraine, including 3.6 million who fled or were forced from their homes after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to the Social Policy Ministery. &quot;About 150,000 internally displaced persons have already returned to the temporarily occupied territories,&quot; said Tkachenko, who serves in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&apos;s parliament, on a committee focused on human rights and the liberation of occupied territories. The figure includes around 70,000 who have returned to the southern city of Mariupol, which was occupied by Russian forces in May 2022 after a months-long siege. Of the approximately 200,000 people who fled Mariupol after the launch of the full-scale war, one third have now returned to the occupied city, Tkachenko said. &quot;According to estimates, this is approximately 67-70,000 people. In my opinion, these are terrible figures,&quot; he said. Inadequate support from the state is part of what prompts people to return to Russian-occupied areas, Tkachenko said. IDPs require more resources and government assistance in order to integrate into new communities. Many IDPs face difficulties securing housing and employment after fleeing their homes. The problem of mass displacement in Ukraine continues to grow, as Russia&apos;s ongoing advance in the east leads to more civilian evacuations. Russia now occupies around 25% of Ukrainian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/150-000-ukrainian-idps-have-returned-to-occupied-regions-mp-says/	2024-11-24T09:01:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178506540.jpg
Russian troops kill 2 civilian women, injure man in Donetsk Oblast's Toretsk, prosecutors say	Russian troops fatally shot two civilian women and injured a man in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast, the regional prosecutor&#x2019;s office reported on Nov. 24. According to the report, at around 6 p.m. on Nov. 21, Russian soldiers entered an apartment in a residential area of Toretsk and &quot;deliberately&quot; opened fire with automatic weapons on three civilians. Two women were killed on the spot, while a man sustained injuries, including fractures to his shoulder and collarbone. An investigation into the incident has been launched, the prosecutor&apos;s office said. Toretsk has emerged as one of the hottest areas in Donetsk Oblast in recent months as Russian forces press their offensive in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine has accused Russian troops of committing over 137,000 war crimes since the start of the full-scale invasion. These include the mass abduction of Ukrainian children, the torture of civilians in occupied areas, and widespread killings.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-kill-2-civilian-women-injure-man-in-donetsk-oblasts-toretsk-prosecutors-say/	2024-11-24T07:01:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2162608242.jpg

Ukraine downs 50 of 73 Russian drones in overnight attack, Air Force says	Ukraine shot down 50 of the 73 drones launched by Russia overnight on Nov. 24, the Air Force reported. Russia reportedly targeted Ukraine with Shahed drones and an unspecified type of drone launched from the Russian oblasts of Oryol and Bryansk. The drones were downed over Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Chernihiv, Sumy, Poltava, and Zhytomyr oblasts, according to the Air Force. There have been no reports of casualties or damage. As of 9 a.m. local time, four Russian drones remained in Ukrainian airspace, with combat operations ongoing. Kyiv authorities reported in the morning that air defense forces shot down more than a dozen drones targeting the capital. &quot;Preliminary reports indicate no damage in the capital, and no information about casualties has been received,&quot; the Kyiv City Military Administration wrote on Telegram. Russia has increased large-scale drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, depleting Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and targeting critical infrastructure. On Nov. 17, Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes of the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched overnight. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), reported on Nov. 18 that Russian forces are using cheap decoy drones with foreign components to overload Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems. According to HUR, Russian manufacturers produce the Gerbera drone &#x2014; a cheaper and less deadly equivalent of Iran&apos;s Shahed &#x2014; at a plant in Yelabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan, central Russia. These drones are reportedly made with components from the United States, China, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-50-of-73-russian-drones-in-overnight-attack-air-force-says/	2024-11-24T00:20:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/shahed.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 730,740 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 730,740 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 24. This number includes 1,020 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,423 tanks, 19,209 armored fighting vehicles, 29,864 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,765 artillery systems, 1,254 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,004 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,366 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-730-740-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-24T00:10:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183828650-1.jpg
Nearly 22,000 civilians have been evacuated from Kharkiv Oblast in 6 months, governor says	Nearly 22,000 residents have been evacuated from Kharkiv Oblast since May, with efforts ongoing to evacuate more residents from settlements near the front line, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Nov. 23. &quot;We are continuing evacuation efforts, bringing both children and adults to safety,&quot; Syniehubov said on air. Kharkiv Oblast has endured constant Russian attacks for over two and a half years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Syniehubov noted that the most targeted areas include the Vovchansk direction in the Chuhuiv district, the Lyptsi area, and the Kupiansk direction. The city of Kupiansk was briefly captured by Russian forces in 2022 before being reclaimed by Ukrainian troops. Its strategic value lies in its position as a key logistics and transportation hub, with several major highways and five railway lines converging within the city. The governor added that evacuees are being provided with humanitarian aid, psychological support, and financial assistance in relatively safe areas, including the city of Kharkiv, located less than 30 kilometers from the Russian border.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-22-000-civilians-evacuated-from-kharkiv-oblast-in-6-months-governor-says/	2024-11-23T21:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1973286879.jpg
Taiwan’s former president urges US to prioritize aiding Ukraine over Taiwan, Politico reports	Former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen emphasized the importance of U.S. support for Ukraine during the Halifax International Security Forum on Nov. 23, urging Washington to prioritize helping Kyiv despite the rising threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. &quot;They should do whatever they can to help the Ukrainians,&quot; Tsai said, according to a Politico report. &quot;We [Taiwan] still have time.&quot; Tsai&#x2019;s comments came after U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Samuel Paparo acknowledged that aiding Ukraine has begun to strain the U.S. military&#x2019;s capacity to prepare for potential conflict in Asia. Paparo highlighted the depletion of critical weapon stockpiles, including Patriots and air-to-air missiles. During her Halifax appearance, Tsai argued that Ukraine&apos;s success against Russian aggression would serve as a global deterrent. &quot;A Ukrainian victory will serve as the most effective deterrent to future aggression,&quot; she said. Taiwan has increased its defense spending by 80% over the past eight years, reaching $19 billion in 2024. However, Tsai dismissed calls for Taiwan to raise its defense budget to 10% of GDP, a suggestion made by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. &quot;We would have some difficulty accepting an arbitrary figure,&quot; she said, according to Politico. While the Biden administration has consistently defended its ability to balance support for Ukraine and preparations for a conflict with China, Trump allies argue otherwise. Tsai remained cautious about Taiwan&apos;s defense strategy under Trump&#x2019;s presidency, declining to comment on potential major arms purchases in early 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/taiwans-former-president-urges-us-to-prioritize-aiding-ukraine-over-taiwan-politico-reports/	2024-11-23T20:37:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2153264373.jpg
Mediazona confirms identities of almost 80,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine	Mediazona, an independent Russian outlet, together with BBC Russia, has confirmed through open-source research the names of 79,819 Russian soldiers killed since the start of Russia&apos;s all-out war. As Vladimir Putin boasted the new Oreshnik nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile, sparking renewed fears of nuclear escalation, Mediazona reported nearly 2,700 additional Russian military deaths in Ukraine over the past two weeks. The confirmed death toll now includes 17,000 volunteers, 14,500 recruited prisoners, and 9,700 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. The Nov. 22 report comes amid growing evidence of widespread violence within Russian military ranks. Recent incidents include the arrests of two commanders, known by the call signs Bely (&quot;White&quot;) and Gvozd (&quot;Nail&quot;), for confining subordinates in dog cages and the death of pro-Kremlin American volunteer Russell Bentley in a military detention facility. Since Russia began its full-scale on Feb. 22, 2022, over 4,364 Russian officers have been killed in combat in Ukraine. According to figures released by Kyiv, total Russian losses in Ukraine had exceeded 700,000 as of Nov. 4, marking an increase of 100,000 in just 77 days. The figures do not distinguish between those killed, wounded, missing, or captured, though they are widely understood to encompass all categories. These numbers mostly align with estimates from Western nations.	https://kyivindependent.com/mediazona-confirms-identities-of-almost-80-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine/	2024-11-23T18:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2159525304.jpg
Ukraine faces wave of attacks with North Korean missiles with Western components, CNN reports	Russia has ramped up its use of North Korean ballistic missiles in strikes against Ukraine, with approximately a third of its 2024 attacks involving these weapons, according to Ukrainian military officials and public records analyzed by CNN. The missiles, powered by Western-made components despite international sanctions, highlight a growing collaboration between Moscow and Pyongyang. North Korea&#x2019;s role in supporting Russia extends beyond weapons, with about 11,000 North Korean soldiers reportedly deployed to Russia&#x2019;s Kursk region. In 2024, Russia launched around 60 North Korean KN-23 missiles, accounting for nearly one-third of the 194 ballistic missile strikes tracked by Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force. August and September saw a surge in these attacks, with Ukrainian officials publicly identifying the KN-23 as a significant threat during that period. &quot;Since the spring, Russia has been using ballistic missiles and attack drones much more to strike Ukraine, and less use of cruise missiles,&quot; Yuriy Ihnat, acting head of communications for Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force, told CNN. Ukrainian investigators have uncovered evidence of extensive use of Western components in the KN-23 missiles. According to Ukraine&#x2019;s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO), nine Western companies, including manufacturers from the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, produced key components for these weapons. &quot;Everything that works to guide the missile, to make it fly, is all foreign components. All the electronics are foreign. There is nothing Korean in it,&quot; Andriy Kulchytskyi, head of the Military Research Laboratory at Kyiv&#x2019;s Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Expertise, told CNN. He noted that the missiles&#x2019; metal casing, which corrodes quickly, appears to be the only Korean-made part. Fragments of the missiles, some produced as recently as 2023, suggest a rapid supply chain funneling components to North Korea. Ukrainian Defense Intelligence officials estimate that about 70% of these parts are American, with the rest sourced from Germany, Switzerland, and other countries. A U.K.-based investigative group, Conflict Armament Research (CAR), previously found that 75% of components in one early KN-23 missile used against Ukraine came from U.S. companies. Missile strikes involving North Korean weapons have killed at least 28 people and injured 213 in Ukraine this year, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general. &quot;Investigating these missiles isn&#x2019;t easy due to the damage, but we can still identify the vast majority of components as Western-made,&quot; said a Ukrainian defense intelligence official. The exact routes by which components reach North Korea remain unclear, according to weapons-tracing experts, though evidence strongly suggests China as the primary conduit. &quot;We have successfully traced some of those components, and the last known custodians are Chinese companies,&quot; said Damien Spleeters, deputy director of operations at Conflict Armament Research (CAR), an organization that independently tracks diverted weapons. According to Spleeters, Chinese firms acquire the components from manufacturers and pass them through a network of intermediaries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-faces-wave-of-attacks-with-north-korean-missiles-with-western-components-cnn-reports/	2024-11-23T17:32:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185328948.jpg
Zelensky criticizes Brazil, G20 leaders for showing 'weak position on war'	President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized Group of 20 (G20) leaders on Nov. 23 following the most recent summit in Brazil, adding that Brazilian President Lula da Silva, the current holder of the G20 Presidency, showed a &quot;weak position&quot; on Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. The group, which includes Russia among its members, also includes a number of countries who have contributed to Russia&apos;s economic development throughout its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including China and India. Despite ongoing divisions among G20 nations regarding the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, negotiators managed to reach a consensus on a statement that broadly condemned the human suffering caused by both wars. For the first time since Russia&apos;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the leaders even came together for a group photo. The communiqu&#xE9; acknowledged the toll of the war in Ukraine and advocated for peace, yet stopped short of directly naming Russia. &quot;If we want good, normal relations between our nations, between our peoples, then, we should probably support people first, not aggressors, leaders of aggression in the world, like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, like today&apos;s modern Russia,&quot; Zelensky said. Zelensky added that a lack of a strong, unified condemnation by G20 leaders led Putin to strike Ukraine with new weapons, including Russia&apos;s use of the new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Dnipro on Nov. 21. &quot;Without a clear stance from major countries &#x2013; the United States, Brazil, Asian and African states &#x2013; agreements with Putin will amount to mere stalling tactics and further intimidation by Russia,&quot; the Presidential Office wrote in a news release.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-criticizes-brazil-g20-leaders-for-showing-weak-position-on-war/	2024-11-23T15:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1636007322.jpg
Russia damaged over 300 port facilities, 20 foreign vessels in the past year, Zelensky says	Russia has damaged 321 port infrastructure facilities, as well as 20 foreign merchant vessels since July 2023, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 23 at the International Conference on Food Security in Kyiv. Traveling along the Black Sea route, ships are regularly at risk of being attacked by Russia. Since the beginning of the all-out war, mines have also been drifting along the trade route, which also poses a risk to maritime transport. As a major grain producer, Ukraine exports about 6 million tons of grain per month through ports along the Black Sea. Following an initial blockade at the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, Russia unilaterally terminated the Black Sea grain deal last year forcing Kyiv to set up a new export route in the Black Sea. Initially envisioned as a humanitarian corridor to allow the departure of ships stranded there since the start of the full-scale war, it has since grown into a full-blown trade route. Last month, Russian forces struck a foreign civilian ships in Odesa, killing a 60 year-old Ukrainian port employee and injuring five foreign nationals. &quot;By attacking civilian vessels, Russia tries to weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s economy and put millions around the world at risk of hunger,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on social media following the attack in October. Speaking at the Grain from Ukraine conference during a program that included journalists from 10 different African countries, Zelensky said that the country&apos;s &quot;food exports provide food for 400 million people in 100 countries around the world.&quot; &quot;Food prices in Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, and other countries in Africa directly depend on whether farmers and agricultural companies in Ukraine can operate normally,&quot; Zelensky added. Attempting to strengthen ties with African nations amid Russia&apos;s continued influence in the region, Zelensky said that seven of the ten embassies that the country announced it was opening in African nations in December 2022 have already been opened, with an additional three opening in the near future.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-damaged-over-300-port-facilities-20-foreign-vessels-in-the-past-year-zelensky-says/	2024-11-23T12:36:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-1243863298.jpg
West should 'not set red lines' on providing military support for Ukraine, French foreign minister says	France&apos;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told the BBC in an excerpt of an interview published on Nov. 23 that Western allies should &quot;not set and express red lines&quot; on providing Ukraine with military support against Russian aggression. The comments come just days after U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine&apos;s use of U.S.-supplied long-range missile to strike targets within Russia, many months after President Volodymyr Zelensky first made the request. Days before the approval, the leaders of France and the U.K. met in Paris on Nov. 11 to discuss a last-ditch attempt to persuade the U.S. to allow Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with Western weapons before Donald Trump enters the White House in January. Barrot&apos;s comments come as EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola, on Nov. 23, also called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to send long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine &#x2014; even as Scholz has repeatedly denied the possibility of supplying Ukraine with the weaponry, fearing that Germany would be brought into the war with Russia. &quot;(France) will support Ukraine as intensely and as long as necessary. Why? Because it is our security that is at stake. Each time the Russian army progresses by one square kilometre, the threat gets one square kilometre closer to Europe,&quot; Barrot said. Barrot stated that Ukraine could use French-supplied long-range missiles &quot;in the logics of self defence&quot; to strike targets within Russia, but did not elaborate as to whether Kyiv has already used the French-provided weapons. During the interview Barrot also hinted France may eventually invite Ukraine to join NATO as part of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;We are open to extending an invitation, and so in our discussions with friends and allies, and friends and allies of Ukraine, we are working to get them to closer to our positions.&quot; Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron said he would consider sending French troops to Ukraine in the case of a Russian breakthrough at the front or if Ukraine requested it. When asked by the BBC whether sending French troops would constitute a so-called red-line, Barrot said that France would &quot;not discard any option.&quot; Barrot&apos;s comments comes as Russia continues to intensify its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. In total, almost 580,000 Russian soldiers are participating in combat against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/west-should-not-set-red-lines-on-providing-military-support-for-ukraine-french-foreign-minister-says/	2024-11-23T11:22:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-2185007597-612x612.jpg
Ukraine has lost over 40% of territory previously gained in Kursk incursion, Reuters reports	Ukraine has lost over 40 per cent of the territory it previously gained in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast due to Russian counterattacks, Reuters reported on Nov. 23, citing a source in Ukraine&apos;s General Staff. &quot;At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres, now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,&quot; the source told Reuters. &quot;Now we control approximately 800 square kilometres. We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.&quot; Ukraine first gained a foothold in Kursk Oblast during a surprise incursion into the Russian region in early August. Since then, Russia has launched extensive counterattacks in an effort to take back the region. NATO allies believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiming to recapture territory lost in Kursk Oblast before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s inauguration on Jan. 20, The Telegraph reported, hoping to gain leverage in future peace negotiations. The source added that nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Kursk Oblast, planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv has previously said that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers have joined the counteroffensive in Kursk, with the General Staff source noting that the majority of North Korean soldiers was finalizing training along Russian forces. The Kyiv Independent has not been able to verify the information provided by the General Staff source. As Russia&apos;s attempt to take back Kursk continues to progress, Russia has also intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. In total, almost 580,000 Russian soldiers are participating in combat against Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-has-lost-over-40-of-territory-previously-gained-in-russias-kursk-oblast-reuters-reports/	2024-11-23T09:48:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/GettyImages-1258245894.jpg
Russia's Oreshnik missile likely had no explosives and didn't cause much damage, Bild analyst claims	Russia&apos;s Oreshnik missile that targeted Dnipro on Nov. 21 likely carried no explosive charge and did not cause any significate damage, German media outlet Bild reported on Nov. 23, citing Bild military analyst Julian Ropcke. The Oreshnik nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile was likely a modification of Russia&apos;s RS-26 Rubezh missile, he said. Ropcke came to this conclusion by analyzing the available footage of the strike. The RS-26 missile would not contain explosives or a warhead and would have been equipped with a substitute of the same size and weight to simulate the appearance of a nuclear warhead, according to Ropcke. &quot;This demonstrates that it was a propaganda and political action rather than a military one. There was neither a nuclear charge nor explosives inside. That&#x2019;s why the damage is so insignificant,&quot; Ropcke said. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously claimed in an address on Nov. 21 that the Oreshnik missile was a newly designed weapon and that there was &quot;no way&quot; of countering this weapon with air defense. Putin went on to say that the missile could be equipped with a nuclear warhead but that missile launched at Dnipro had been a &quot;test launch&quot; which did not include one.	https://kyivindependent.com/bild-russias-oreshnik-missile-that-targeted-dnipro-was-actually-modified-rubezh-missile/	2024-11-23T09:15:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185260447.jpg
Zaluzhnyi: Use of technological advancements will prevent 'serious' front line breakthrough until 2027	Newfound technological advancements during wartime will prevent serious front line breakthroughs along the Ukraine-Russia border until around 2027, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., told Ukrainska Pravda in an interview published on Nov. 23. &quot;When robots began to appear massively on the battlefield, they made any movement of soldiers impossible. The inability to fight robots led to a standstill. We couldn&#x2019;t move forward towards the Russians, and the Russians, accordingly, couldn&#x2019;t move forward either,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. Zaluzhnyi added that this was a temporary period of adaptation and, based on his predictions, by around 2027, the use of such technology could become so commonplace that the potential to achieve serious breakthroughs on the front line would resume. Russia has intensified its attacks along the eastern front in recent weeks, putting Ukrainian forces under mounting pressure as they struggle to defend key positions. Russia also continues to increase its attacks against civilian targets, amid an expected harsh winter plagued by energy shortages. On Nov. 21, in a show of force, Russia launched a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Dnipro. The attack comes as news that Russia has began producing thermobaric drones to target Ukraine, which are capable of causing &quot;simply terrifying&quot; hard to civilian populations, including collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, and brain damage, according to a source familiar with Russian drone production. Despite the onslaught of attacks and use of new weaponry, Russian troops have sustained record casualties since the start of the full-scale war and have yet to fully breach Ukrainian defenses to seize the entirety of Donetsk Oblast and continue their assault. According to estimates by Ukraine&apos;s General Staff, Russia suffered a staggering 1,420 casualties on Nov. 22. &#xA0; Despite Russia tapping about 11,000 North Korean soldiers to support its attempt to regain territory in Kursk Oblast, questions surrounding their effectiveness remains amid significant language barriers as well as a lack of active combat experience. According to Zaluzhnyi, Russia is not able to expand the front line, as it would require huge resources &quot;which the Russians no longer have.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/zaluzhnyi-technological-advancements-during-wartime-prevent-serious-front-line-breakthrough-until-2027/	2024-11-23T08:43:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173728155.jpg
Media: EU parliament speaker calls for sending Taurus missiles to Ukraine	EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola is in favor of Germany sending long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine in light of Russia&apos;s recent escalatory measures, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported on Nov. 23. &quot;Yes, that is also the position of the EU Parliament,&quot; Metsola said in an interview, as quoted by FAZ. &quot;There is broad support for this demand. We will see whether there will be a corresponding change of course after the (German) federal election.&quot; Calls for Germany to supply Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles were renewed once the U.S. authorized Ukraine to use its ATACMS long-range missiles against targets in Russia earlier in November. A German government spokesperson told the AFP news agency on Nov. 18 that Scholz &quot;made his position clear&quot; on the matter following news from the U.S. and would &quot;not change his stance anymore.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly denied the possibility of supplying Ukraine with the weaponry, fearing that Germany would be brought into the war with Russia. However, Germany is set to hold elections in late February, and center-right CDU/CSU chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz has conveyed his openness to the delivery of Taurus missiles under certain conditions.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-broad-support-in-eu-parliament-for-germany-to-supply-ukraine-taurus-missiles/	2024-11-23T08:34:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1905669539.jpg
NATO Secretary General Rutte meets with Trump	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte met with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in Florida on Nov. 23, the military alliance reported. Rutte and Trump discussed a range of security issues facing NATO, according to the press release. No details were immediately available as to the specifics of the discussions. Rutte also reportedly met with U.S. Congressman Mike Waltz, who Trump picked as his national security adviser, as well as other members of Trump&apos;s incoming national security team. &#xA0;Waltz has previously expressed reservation over U.S. military aid for Ukraine, believing Europe should increase its spending. Rutte and Trump&apos;s meeting occurred against the backdrop of concerns that Trump&apos;s second term in office could see diminished support for Ukraine&apos;s war effort or even a lesser role played by the U.S. in the military alliance. In February, Trump stirred up controversy when, on the campaign trail, he said that Russia could do &quot;whatever the hell they want&quot; to NATO member countries failing to meet NATO&apos;s 2% defense spending criteria. Allies remain cautiously optimistic that Trump will continue supporting Ukraine and NATO, particularly if the efforts are framed as a demonstration of U.S. strength. During a meeting with European leaders in Budapest on Nov. 7, Rutte previously backed Trump&apos;s earlier attempts to get NATO countries to spend more on defense, beyond the current 2% of GDP target. After congratulating Trump on winning the election, Rutte wrote on Nov. 6 on X that &quot;his leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/nato-defense-secretary-mark-rutte-meets-with-trump/	2024-11-23T08:17:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/241123-SG-Trump_rdax_775x440s.jpg
Zelensky marks Holodomor Remembrance Day	President Volodomor Zelensky marked Holodomor Remembrance Day on Nov. 23, honoring the victims of the Soviet man-made famine that killed an estimated three to five million Ukrainians. The Holodomor occurred from 1932 to 1933 under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin&apos;s rule. The Ukrainian government has called on the international community to recognize it as a genocide against the Ukrainian people. On Holodomor Remembrance Day, Ukrainians traditionally light a candle at 4 p.m. and place it in their window to honor the memories of those who perished in the famine. &quot;They wanted to destroy us. To kill us. To subjugate us. They failed. They wanted to hide the truth and silence the terrible crimes forever. They failed,&quot; Zelensky wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. &quot;They wanted to confuse us, mislead us, make us doubt&#x2014;to forget, and in forgetting, to forgive. They failed.&quot; Several of Ukraine&apos;s European allies also marked Holodomor Remembrance Day. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola wrote that &quot;Europe joins the people of Ukraine to remember and pay tribute (to the victims).&quot; &quot;Russia continues what it started 91 years ago &#x2013; trying to erase the Ukrainian nation from the Earth. Then via manmade famine, today with rockets, missiles, bombs, murders, rape, attacks on ports, energy facilities,&quot; Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze wrote, noting that Latvia recognized the Holodomor as a genocide in 2008.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-marks-holodomor-remembrance-day/	2024-11-23T07:29:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1801988425.jpg
Bloomberg: Declassified US intelligence memorandum details Russia's suspected targeting of political adversaries abroad	A declassified U.S. intelligence memorandum sheds light on Russia&apos;s suspected assassination attempts of political adversaries abroad, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 23. The intelligence assessment, which Bloomberg obtained through the U.S.&apos;s Freedom of Information Act, details how U.S. intelligence believed in 2016 that suspected Kremlin-ordered assassinations abroad would likely persist. The document includes well-known cases, such as the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, a former FSB agent who defected to the U.K. Litvinenko accused Putin&apos;s regime of a number of crimes, including that the FSB was allegedly behind the 1999 bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and other Russian cities that were originally blamed on Chechen rebels. Among other things, he also said Putin and his circle had ties to organized crime. Litvinenko died of radiation poisoning in 2006 and blamed Putin before his death. British intelligence concluded that Russia likely carried out the assassination, according to the U.S. intelligence memorandum. The document also lists former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, who was poisoned on the campaign trail during the 2004 presidential election, leaving his face temporarily disfigured. It does not purport that Moscow was directly involved in his poisoning but states that his supporters believe Moscow was behind it. Yushchenko, a pro-West politician, barely survived a poising during his election campaign in which he faced pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, backed by Putin. Following the poising, Yushchenko went on to lead the Orange Revolution, a public uprising sparked by mass election fraud that saw Yanukovych being declared the winner. Following a new round of voting Yushchenko won and became Ukraine&apos;s third president only to lose to Yanukovych in the next election. Bloomberg noted that, although the document was dated, it showed that the U.S. believed Moscow&apos;s willingness to target people abroad&#x2014;ranging from Caucasus rebels to intelligence defectors and dissidents.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-document-about-assassinations-suspected-by-russia/	2024-11-23T06:32:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185260447.jpg
Media: Polish farmers block Ukrainian border crossing	Polish farmers staged a protest in the village of Medyka on the morning of Nov. 23, blocking the road leading to the Shehyni border crossing with Ukraine, Polish media outlet RMF24 reported. Farmers are protesting the Polish government&apos;s failure to maintain the agricultural tax rate in 2024 at the same level as in 2023, according to RMF24. They are also reportedly protesting over concerns about the European Union signing a free trade agreement with South American countries in the Mercosur bloc. Only one truck per hour traveling from Poland to Ukraine will be allowed to pass, according to RMF24. Trucks coming from Ukraine are not allowed to pass, but cars, buses, vehicles with humanitarian aid, and military convoys can pass the crossing. The protest is expected to last 48 hours, but if their concerns are not met, they are reportedly ready to protest &quot;around the clock&quot; until the end of the year, RMF24 wrote. Polish farmers have staged multiple protests at border crossings between Poland and Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, including protests against Ukrainian agricultural imports in the EU.	https://kyivindependent.com/media-polish-farmers-stage-protest-at-medyka-shehyni-border-crossing-unrelated-to-ukraine/	2024-11-23T05:20:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2025718523--1-.jpg
Ministry: Lithuania to fund production of Ukrainian long-range drones	Lithuania will fund the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced on Nov. 23. The long-term agreement between Ukraine and Lithuania includes an initial tranche of 10 million euros which has already been agreed upon and focuses particularly on Ukraine&apos;s Palianytsia missile-like drones. &quot;I expressed gratitude to the Republic of Lithuania for its steadfast support during these challenging times and personally thanked (Defense Minister Laurynas) Kasciunas for his leadership,&quot; Umerov wrote. Umerov and his Lithuanian counterpart also reportedly discussed plans to equip Ukrainian brigades, provide ammunition, strengthen air defense, and expand defense industry cooperation between the two countries as &quot;key priorities&quot; for 2025. The Defense Ministry previously announced on Nov. 22 that Sweden had also agreed to finance the production of long-range drones for Ukraine to aid the country in its defense against Russia&apos;s war of aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/ministry-lithuania-to-fund-production-of-ukrainian-long-range-drones/	2024-11-23T03:56:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/467809228_965309755417365_1519841508642714684_n.jpg
Russian forces reportedly advance near 5 settlements in Donetsk Oblast	Russian forces are reportedly advancing near five settlements in Donetsk Oblast, the crowd-sourced monitoring website Deep State reported on Nov. 23. The settlement of Velyka Novosilka was targeted directly by a military column of &quot;at least&quot; five armored fighting vehicles, as well as two others through tree lines south of the settlement of Rozdolne, according to Deep State. Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops out of Rozdolne, but the situation in the area remains &quot;extremely challenging,&quot; Deep State reported. In addition to Velyka Novosilka and Rozdolne, Russian forces are advancing near Maksymivka, Pustynka, and Toretsk, Deep State wrote. Russia has been mounting increasingly intense attacks along multiple areas of the eastern front, attempting to breach Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast and to reach the cities of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-reportedly-advance-near-5-settlements-in-donetsk-oblast/	2024-11-23T02:25:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183828650-1.jpg
Ministry: Sweden agrees to finance production of long-range drones for Ukraine	Sweden has agreed to finance the production of Ukrainian long-range drones, Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 22. The announcement came during Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov&apos;s working visit in Sweden and his talks with his Swedish counterpart Pal Jonson. The defense ministers also discussed plans for military aid to Ukraine in 2025, including efforts to equip military units with hardware, which Umerov said are in the &#x201C;final stages&#x201D; of negotiation. &#x201C;For us, this is not just about partnership but also about shared security,&#x201D; Umerov said, as quoted by the Defense Ministry. According to the Defense Ministry, Umerov also met with representatives of Swedish defense companies. Sweden announced a new aid package for Ukraine worth 9 million euros ($9.8 million) in early November, which included two vessels designed to enhance maritime security.	https://kyivindependent.com/defense-ministry-sweden-agrees-to-finance-production-of-long-range-drones/	2024-11-23T00:57:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/1_467842476_3de048d004.webp
General Staff: Russia has lost 729,720 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 729,720 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 23. This number includes 1,420 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,419 tanks, 19,192 armored fighting vehicles, 29,850 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,760 artillery systems, 1,254 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,004 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,365 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-729-720-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-22T23:10:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Republican senator, Trump ally rejects idea of negotiating with Putin	U.S. Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican and ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said on Nov. 22 that Russia could not be trusted to engage in peace negotiations to end the full-scale war in Ukraine. &#xA0; &quot;As much as I would like to believe we can negotiate with a tyrant, I suspect we may be deceiving ourselves,&quot; Rounds said at the Halifax Security Forum, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rounds&apos; remarks stand in stark contrast to the views expressed by Trump, who has repeatedly pressed for a swift deal to end the war. Trump has also spoken admiringly of Putin on a number of occasions. &quot;Do you believe that this tyrant, if you offer him a part of a free country, do you think he&apos;s gonna stop?&quot; Rounds said, as reported by Politico. &quot;I wish I could say there&#x2019;s an easy way out, there&apos;s not.&quot; While many of Trump&apos;s congressional allies have opposed ongoing military aid to Ukraine, Senate Republicans are generally pro-Ukraine and skeptical of negotiating with Moscow. Rounds went so far as to express frustration that the U.S. has not provided more weapons to Kyiv. &quot;I just feel so frustrated that we have not been able to provide them all of the equipment that they need, and all of the weapons systems that they need, in order to respond to the absolute tyranny coming from Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;I wonder why we haven&apos;t done more more quickly than we have.&quot; Rounds did not criticize Trump directly and pointed out that his views were not those of the incoming presidential administration. Trump takes office on Jan. 20, 2025. His push for speedy negotiations has sparked fears that Washington will pressure Kyiv to accept a deal that favors Moscow, including territorial concessions and a possible promise not to join NATO.	https://kyivindependent.com/republican-senator-trump-ally-rejects-idea-of-negotiating-with-putin/	2024-11-22T21:48:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1850051282.jpg
Whoever enters parliament enters Russia,' Georgian president says	Entering the Georgian parliament following the widely disputed results of Tbilisi&apos;s October parliamentary elections is the same as entering Russia, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said during an interview with local television on Nov. 22. &quot;Whoever enters the parliament today will enter Russia,&quot; she told the Georgian broadcaster Mtavari Arkhi. Zourabichvili has accused the ruling pro-Russian Georgian Dream party of rigging the recent elections and refused to accept the stated results. Along with other opposition party leaders, she has called for public demonstrations and a parliamentary boycott. &quot;I am sure that the parties will not enter the parliament,&quot; she said. According to Zourabichvili, the 2024 elections were defined by fraud on an unprecedented scale. &quot;There was, as always, what I call &apos;normal rigging,&apos; and they make fun of me for it, but the feeling that the elections and the country were stolen from us did not exist,&quot; she said. &quot;The situation is very different. Today, whoever enters the parliament will enter Russia.&quot; Official results of the October election show Georgian Dream securing nearly 54% of the vote, but pro-EU opposition leaders and international observers have highlighted widespread allegations of intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and vote-buying. The disputed results triggered large-scale protests in Tbilisi. Police began dispersing and arresting demonstrators on Nov. 18, though organizers promised to continue protesting. Zourabichvili also insists that if Georgian Dream continues to stand by the allegedly fraudulent election results, they will govern alone. &quot;They are alone,&quot; she said. &quot;They are alone in the parliament, they are alone in the government. The government, the parliament, is one-party, under the vertical of one person, and all the institutions that exist in the country are completely dependent on this one party.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/whoever-enters-parliament-enters-russia-georgian-president-says/	2024-11-22T21:13:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175488096-1.jpg
Crimean Tatar editor goes missing in occupied Crimea	Ediye Muslimova, the editor-in-chief of a Crimean Tatar children&apos;s magazine, disappeared in Russian-occupied Crimea on Nov. 21, according to the NGO Crimean Solidarity. Lutfiye Zudiyeva, a journalist and human rights activist, said Muslimova was seen being put into a white GAZelle vehicle by three unknown men near her home the morning of Nov. 21. Crimea has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Following Moscow&apos;s illegal annexation, Russia began targeting the peninsula&apos;s indigenous Tatar population, which has been particularly vocal in resisting the occupation. Muslimova&apos;s family became concerned after Muslimova, 61, would not answer or return calls, according to her niece, Elzara. &quot;I started calling &#x2014; she has two phones (a work phone and her regular phone), both phones are turned off,&quot; Elzara Muslimova said. &quot;There is no connection: no Telegram, no WhatsApp, no Viber.&quot; Zudiyeva&apos;s account of an apparent abduction was supported by Zarema Bariieva, manager of the Crimean Tatar Resource Center (CTRC). &quot;Recently, it became known that a 61-year-old woman is being held in the FSB (Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service) building,&quot; she said in a Facebook post. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these reports at the time of publication. Muslimova is the daughter of Crimean Tatar activitst Refat Muslimov and editor of the children&apos;s magazine &quot;Armanchyk,&quot; which has been published monthly since 2011. It is reportedly the only glossy children&apos;s magazine in the Crimean Tatar language. According to the CTRC, 70% of all political prisoners in occupied Crimea are Crimean Tatars.	https://kyivindependent.com/crimean-tatar-editor-goes-missing-in-occupied-crimea/	2024-11-22T19:50:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/armanchyk.jpeg
NASAMS air defense systems delivered to Ukraine, Canadian defense minister says	A promised shipment of air defense systems purchased with the assistance of the Canadian government has reached Ukraine, Canada&apos;s Defense Minister Bill Blair announced on Nov. 22. The U.S.-made National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) were first pledged to Kyiv back in January 2023. While Canada reportedly paid for the system, worth approximately $289 million, later in the spring, its delivery has been delayed. Blair said the NASAMS are now in Ukrainian hands. &quot;This ground-based air defense system will help Ukraine protect itself against destructive air attacks,&quot; Blair said. &quot;Canada&apos;s support for Ukraine is steadfast and we will continue to step up and build on our contributions to Ukraine in their fight against Russia&apos;s invasion.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky previously said on Nov. 4 that Ukraine expected to receive the defense system &quot;by the end of this year.&quot; The NASAMS delivery arrives as Ukraine faces intensified Russian aerial attacks, including the recently deployed &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), launched against Dnipro on Nov. 21. Following the strike on Dnipro, Zelensky reiterated the importance of advanced Western air defense systems, directing Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to begin new talks with partners on acquiring additional equipment. Ukrainian forces have been using NASAMS systems since November 2022, when the U.S. delivered the first batteries amid escalating Russian airstrikes.	https://kyivindependent.com/nasams-air-defense-systems-delivered-to-ukraine-canadian-defense-minister-says/	2024-11-22T18:54:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2002538371.jpg
Trump may name former intelligence director Richard Grenell as Ukraine peace envoy, Reuters reports	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is considering naming his former intelligence director, diplomat Richard Grenell, as a special Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on an end to Russia&apos;s war, Reuters reported on Nov. 22. Fox News previously reported on Nov. 13 that Trump planned to announce a special envoy to take the lead on peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Throughout his campaign, Trump insisted he would negotiate a swift end to Russia&apos;s all-out war in Ukraine if reelected. Grenell is a contender for the new position, four sources close to Trump&apos;s transition plans told Reuters. Grenell served as U.S. Ambassador to Germany during Trump&apos;s first presidential term and &#xA0;as acting National Intelligence Director for a period in 2020. He was also appointed Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations from 2019-2021. In July, Grenell told Bloomberg that a path to peace in Ukraine could include the creation of &quot;autonomous zones,&quot; though he did not explain what this would entail. &quot;Autonomous regions can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but you got to work through those details,&quot; he said. Grenell also said he did not think Ukraine should become a member of NATO in the near future. The sources who spoke to Bloomberg said it was still possible Trump could change his mind about establishing the Ukraine envoy position.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-may-name-former-intelligence-director-richard-grenell-as-ukraine-peace-envoy-reuters-reports/	2024-11-22T17:58:26-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162458237.jpg
Lukashenko threatens internet blackout during 2025 elections to prevent protests	Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has stated that he may completely shut down the internet during the 2025 presidential elections if protests similar to those in 2020 arise, state-run news outlet Belta reported on Nov. 22. &quot;If this [the protests] happens again, we will shut the internet down completely,&quot; Lukashenko said, admitting that internet shutdowns during the 2020 protests were carried out with his approval. Speaking at Minsk State Linguistic University, he justified the 2020 internet blackout by claiming it was necessary to protect the country&#x2019;s stability, as protests were allegedly organized online, particularly from abroad. Lukashenko also denied allegations of violence against demonstrators, asserting, &quot;No one was holding down or beating anyone,&quot; despite widespread reports of police brutality during the 2020 protests. Lukashenko, the country&apos;s leader since 1994 and Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s closest ally, has long been accused of staging fraudulent elections in Belarus. In 2020, during the last presidential election, Lukashenko maintained power despite the country&apos;s most prominent opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, receiving popular support &#x2014; claiming she won with 60 percent of the vote. Following the fabricated results, mass protest erupted in Minsk but were ultimately quelled with the support of Russia. According to the Belarusian human rights group Viasna, over 50,000 citizens have been detained for political reasons since the 2020 election. His remarks come as Belarus approaches its next presidential election, amid ongoing international scrutiny of his 30-year rule and the repression of dissent.	https://kyivindependent.com/lukashenko-threatens-internet-blackout-during-2025-elections-to-prevent-protests/	2024-11-22T16:29:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162854097.jpg
Ukraine begins talks with partners about advanced air defense systems, following Russia's ICBM strike	President Volodymyr Zelensky has directed Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to engage with partners on acquiring advanced air defense systems, according to Zelensky&#x2019;s statement on Nov. 22. This initiative is in response to Russia launching a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &#x201C;Oreshnik&#x201D; against Dnipro, east Ukraine, on the morning of Nov. 21. The attack came in the wake of what appeared to be Ukraine&apos;s first successful strike of a military target inside Russia using the U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. The IRBM missiles are only guided during the initial stages of launch, so they can be less accurate than cruise missiles, but have the advantage of reaching incredibly high speeds &#x2014; sometimes more than 3,200 kilometers per hour &#x2014; as they approach their targets. &quot;The Minister of Defense of Ukraine is already holding meetings with our partners regarding new air defense systems&#x2014;precisely such systems that are capable of protecting lives from new risks,&quot; Zelensky said on Telegram. He emphasized that Russia&apos;s testing of experimental missiles constitutes an international crime and criticized Moscow for escalating aggression despite global calls for peace. Zelensky promised to share details about the missile attack on Dnipro with international media, so that the full extent is known to global audiences.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-begins-talks-with-partners-about-advanced-air-defense-systems-following-russias-icbm-strike/	2024-11-22T14:14:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/Fwg-DGnWIAkfPD2.jpg
Hungary criticizes US sanctions on Gazprombank as 'threat to energy security', Bloomberg reports	Hungary criticized U.S. sanctions on Gazprombank, stating that they pose a threat to the energy security of Central European countries, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 22. The move is an &#x201C;attack on our sovereignty,&#x201D; Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, speaking at the Istanbul Energy Forum. &#x201C;Hungary is grateful to Turkey, Bulgaria, and Serbia for ensuring a very safe, very reliable, and very stable transit.&#x201D; Along with Slovakia and Austria, Hungary remains reliant on Russian gas, paid for through the now-sanctioned Gazprombank. Hungary receives roughly 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas on an annual basis under a 15-year deal signed in 2021. Gazprom and Hungary&apos;s MVM energy company signed a memorandum of understanding on increasing gas supplies at a forum in St. Petersburg on Oct. 10. Budapest is broadly seen as the most Moscow-friendly country within the EU and NATO, repeatedly obstructing aid to Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Szijjarto has also repeatedly visited Russia throughout the full-scale war, a step that his European colleagues avoided.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-criticizes-us-sanctions-on-gazprombank-as-threat-to-energy-security-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-22T13:22:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/upd_GettyImages-1240297857.jpg
What is Russia's Oreshnik missile, and what happens next?	Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 announced his country had launched a new type of missile in an attack on Ukraine, a demonstration of military might meant to deter Kyiv&apos;s allies from further support against his full-scale invasion. &quot;There are currently no ways of countering this weapon. The missiles attack targets at a speed of 10 Mach, that&apos;s 2.5-3 km per second,&quot; he said. &quot;We are ready for any developments. If anyone still doubts this, they shouldn&apos;t. There will always be a response.&quot; Putin said the &quot;new missile&quot; was called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; but analysts and officials have since questioned the novelty of the weapon, as well as how effective it could be to prevent allies&apos; support of Ukraine. According to Putin, Oreshnik, which means &quot;hazel&quot; in English, is a new invention that Western air defense systems would not be able to intercept. The Oreshnik is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead during this attack. &quot;In combat conditions, a test was carried out of one of the latest Russian intermediate-range missile systems. In this case, with a non-nuclear hypersonic version of a ballistic missile,&quot; he said in a live speech on Nov. 21. The Oreshnik described by Putin is so new that barely anything is known about it other than what he claimed during his speech. The reality however, appears to be slightly different. &quot;I&apos;d be extremely shocked if this missile system had more than 10% new parts,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;I think basically they just took apart the RS-26 or just cannibalized it, and then put together this new missile with a couple of upgrades, and a new paint job.&quot; The RS-26 Hoffman refers to is the RS-26 Rubezh, of which quite a bit is known. First produced in 2011, and successfully tested in 2012, the Rubezh is a 36,000 kilogram, nuclear capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with a known range of 5,800 kilometers. Its declared but undemonstrated range of 6,000 kilometers would only just nudge it into the category of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Its development and deployment was actually halted in 2018 in favor of the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle. The Rubezh is equipped with a MIRV payload, which stands for Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles, which can be seen in videos of the attack on Dnipro. Footage shows multiple projectiles hitting the ground, but without the large explosions normally associated with conventional missiles or payloads, suggesting it was carrying essentially a dummy warhead. On Nov. 22, HUR provided further details of Oreshnik, claiming it is actually just a different name for a previously known missile called &quot;Kedr,&quot; translated as &quot;cedar,&quot; which Russia tested in October 2023 and June 2024. The missile that struck Dnipro was equipped with six warheads, each containing six submunitions, and reached speeds exceeding Mach 11 (around 13,500 kilometers per hour) as it descended, HUR added. &quot;I think it&apos;s really important that we don&apos;t overreact,&quot; Hoffman said, adding the missile itself isn&apos;t anything particularly new despite what Putin said on Nov. 21. &quot;I like his &apos;hypersonic&apos; comment &#x2014; of course he had to put that in, but every medium-range ballistic missile will reach hypersonic velocity at one point, so this is just nothing,&quot; he adds. A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity echoed the sentiment, telling the Kyiv Independent that while &quot;we take all threats against Ukraine seriously, it is important to keep a few key facts in mind.&quot; &quot;Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon. &quot;Let me be clear: Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters, or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game changer in this conflict.&quot; What is potentially new is the global geopolitical situation, the level of tension, and the threats of escalation. The deployment of the missile came shortly after Russia adopted changes to its nuclear deterrence doctrine, which lowered the threshold for a nuclear response. The Kremlin was very clear that the doctrine changes were a signal to the West. &quot;While the doctrine serves as a signal to decision-makers and national security apparatuses, the missile strike is aimed at the general public,&quot; says Matej Kandr&#xED;k, the executive director at the Adapt Institute. Russia has deployed nuclear-capable missiles in Ukraine before, but Oreshnik&apos;s features, like its MRV (multiple reentry vehicle) capability, &quot;invoke the scary, apocalyptic image of nuclear war and therefore allow our imaginations to do a lot of the work for Putin,&quot; Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent. Russia has been employing covert or overt nuclear threats to deter international support for Ukraine since day one of the full-scale invasion. The Kremlin&apos;s &quot;red lines&quot; failed to influence the West from supplying tanks, fighter jets, and long-range missiles. Putin is now attempting to demonstrate strength after U.S. and British missiles struck targets on Russian sovereign territory. &quot;Putin&apos;s problem is that he is running out of ways to convey this message, given all the times that he and other senior Russian officials have warned against certain courses of action&#x2026; and hinted at dire consequences but then confined their escalation of the war to increasingly brutal attacks on Ukraine&apos;s civilian population and infrastructure,&quot; Mathers said. According to Kandrik, Putin&apos;s &quot;ideal outcome would be a prohibition on the use of U.S.-provided deep-strike weapons within its territory and restrictions on future deliveries of such systems.&quot; Mathers also sees it as an attempt to deter broader Western support for Ukraine. Western officials denounced the IRBM launch as an escalation but also made clear that it would not deter their support for Ukraine. &quot;Deploying this capability will neither change the course of the conflict nor deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,&quot; NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said. The calculus may change after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, as his team is likely to seek a quick settlement to &quot;get out&quot; of the conflict. It remains unclear whether the incoming president, who has often criticized military aid for Ukraine, will keep the long-range strikes policy in place if it could spark further escalatory moves by Russia. &quot;Putin knows that the clock is ticking for both Russia and Ukraine as we get closer to Jan. 20 and Donald Trump&apos;s return to the U.S. presidency,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Therefore, what Putin needs is to convey the impression that Russia is in a commanding position and can continue to fight for as long as it needs to in order to achieve victory.&quot; Experts say, however, that Oreshnik&apos;s launch is not the start of an escalation chain leading to a nuclear apocalypse. &quot;Let&apos;s keep a cool head&#x2026; . We have a mechanism in place. It&apos;s called an escalation ladder with a lot of steps to go through between nuclear saber-rattling or nuclear messaging, which is what&apos;s happening now, and the nuclear first use of preemptive strike,&quot; Mathieu Boul&#xE8;gue, a senior fellow at the CEPA think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;The Russian leadership is not suicidal. The moment they start going a bit too far in nuclear escalation&#x2026; this will be the end for the Russian regime.&quot; Federico Borsari, a resident fellow at CEPA, pointed out that Russia warned the U.S. about the missile&apos;s use in advance and that Iskander and Kinzhal missiles that Russia regularly uses in Ukraine can carry a nuclear warhead as well. Oreshnik&apos;s use &quot;is clearly a political message,&quot; but not one indicating a nuclear escalation, he concludes.	https://kyivindependent.com/what-is-russias-oreshnik-missile-and-what-happens-next/	2024-11-22T12:13:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Russian military shoot 5 Ukrainian POWs near Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast	Russian troops shot dead five captured Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers near Vuhledar in Donetsk Oblast in early October, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office said on Nov. 22. The killing of prisoners of war (POWs) is a violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a serious international crime. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched an investigation into the killing of Ukrainian soldiers near Vuhledar, from which Ukrainian forces withdrew on Oct. 2. Investigators believe the soldiers were shot dead on the day the Ukrainian army retreated as Russian troops stormed their positions, according to the statement. During one of the attacks, the Russian military captured five unarmed Ukrainian servicemen. &quot;They (the Russian military) killed one of them in a forest belt and took four of them to the road at gunpoint, where they also shot them dead,&quot; the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office said. The regional prosecutor&apos;s office earlier reported that in a separate incident the Russian military had shot dead two Ukrainian POWs in Donetsk Oblast&apos;s Pokrovsk district in mid-November.

Ukraine war latest: Russia likely used ballistic missile from 'Kedr' complex to strike Dnipro, intelligence says	Key developments on Nov. 22: The ballistic missile launched by Russia on Nov. 21 against the city of Dnipro was likely part of the &quot;Kedr&quot; missile complex tested in recent years, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. Several companies part of the Russian military-industrial complex were involved in developing &quot;Kedr,&quot; which was tested at the Kapustin Yar test site in 2023 and 2024, HUR said on Nov. 22. HUR&apos;s statement comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his televised address to the nation on Nov. 21 that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; The missile was launched at Dnipro from Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and covered nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) in 15 minutes, according to HUR. The missile was equipped with six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. The speed on the final section of the missile&apos;s trajectory was over Mach (&#x41C;) 11. At a temperature of 15&#xB0;C (59&#xB0;F), the speed of 1 M in the atmosphere is 1,225 kilometers per hour (716 miles per hour). &quot;It is an experimental system. Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s a medium-range ballistic missile. It is a carrier of nuclear weapons. The fact that they used it in a non-nuclear version is, as they (Russians) say, a warning from them that they have not gone completely crazy,&quot; military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said at an event on Nov. 22. Budanov called Russia&apos;s latest development &quot;a prototype,&quot; adding that it is not currently in mass production. Russian media circulated information about the development of a missile system called &quot;Kedr&quot; in 2021, labeling it &quot;a new-generation strategic complex.&quot; Initial reports by Ukrainian authorities suggested that Russia had test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile to target Dnipro. Later that evening, Putin said the new &quot;Oreshnik&quot; IRBM had allegedly been used. Little is known about the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; missile referred to by Putin, but military expert Yan Matveev told Russian independent media outlet IStories that it could be a modified version of the &quot;Rubezh&quot; IRBM. The RS-26 &quot;Rubezh&quot; is reported to have a range of up to 6,000 kilometers and can carry four warheads, each with an estimated payload of 0.3 megatons. Russia aims to launch the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into mass production, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Nov. 22 during a meeting with the representatives of the Russian Defense Ministry and the national military-industrial complex. Putin denied that the Oreshnik is a modernization of old Soviet systems, as the missile is allegedly based on &quot;the latest Russian developments.&quot; The Russian president added that there are no analogs of such weapons in the world, nor are there any means to intercept them. &quot;Given its striking power, especially in mass use, and combined with other high-precision long-range systems Russia also has, its use against enemy targets will be comparable to strategic weapons. Although the system is not a strategic weapon,&quot; Putin claimed. Russian forces still have a stockpile of these missile systems ready for use, according to Putin. The Russian president also said that Russia will continue to test the Oreshnik missile, including in combat conditions. Putin added that Russia is working on a series of medium- and short-range missiles. Several Russian systems are allegedly being tested and planned for mass production. Russia gave North Korea oil and anti-aircraft missiles in return for military support in Ukraine, according to a South Korean official, and satellite imagery analysis. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12. South Korea&apos;s national security advisor Shin Won-sik on Nov. 22 said Moscow had provided Pyongyang with economic and military technology in exchange for the troops. &quot;It is understood that North Korea has been provided with related equipment and anti-aircraft missiles to strengthen Pyongyang&apos;s weak air defense system,&quot; Shin said in an interview with South Korea&apos;s SBS News. Elsewhere, the BBC on Nov. 22 reported that Russia is estimated to have supplied North Korea with more than a million barrels of oil since March this year, a breach of international sanctions. Pyongyang is subject to a strict cap on oil transfers, imposed by the U.N. Security Council in 2017 after a series of nuclear weapons tests. The claim was based on an analysis of satellite imagery by the Open Source Center, a non-profit research group based in the U.K. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that the oil is payment for weapons and troops sent to Moscow to fuel the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership agreement in June. Under the treaty, the two countries pledge to help each other if either is attacked. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui visited Moscow and met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Nov. 4. &quot;Our country will stand firmly by our Russian comrades until the day of victory,&quot; Choe said, calling Moscow&apos;s offensive against Ukraine a &quot;sacred struggle.&quot; Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., claimed that the direct involvement of Russia&apos;s allies, such as North Korea, in the war against Ukraine was evidence of a global conflict. Nearly 60,000 Russian army personnel are currently stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Suspilne reported on Nov. 22, citing its undisclosed source in the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Earlier reports from Ukrainian authorities said Russia had amassed 50,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, including North Korean soldiers, to attempt to push the Ukrainian military out of its territory. Ukrainian forces will remain in Kursk Oblast as long as &quot;militarily possible,&quot; the source said. According to the source, the General Staff believes that the Russian troops are planning to reach the border with Sumy Oblast to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; there, as Ukraine looked to do with its incursion into Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk Oblast on Aug. 6. Russian forces have managed to reclaim around half of the territory initially captured by Ukrainian troops. Russia has also deployed thousands of North Korean troops in the embattled region, with some reportedly already clashing with Ukraine in small-scale battles. Around 11,000 North Korean soldiers were stationed in Kursk Oblast as of Nov. 4. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have suffered 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 injured, and 717 captured during the three months of the Kursk offensive. The war in Ukraine has reached a &quot;decisive phase,&quot; and the latest events demonstrate the real threat of a &quot;global conflict,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Nov. 22. Tusk&apos;s comments came in the wake of Russia&apos;s attack on Dnipro a day earlier, in which Moscow claims a new missile, an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; was tested. Speaking at the Congress of the Polish Teachers&apos; Union, Tusk referred to what he called &quot;the events of the last dozen hours&quot; as demonstrating there is a &quot;serious and real threat of global conflict.&quot; &quot;It would be hard for me not to say a few fundamental words today about the situation, because it is historic,&quot; he said in comments reported by Polish outlet Radio Zet. &quot;The war in the east is entering its decisive phase. We all know it. We feel that the unknown is approaching. None of us knows the end of this conflict, but we know that it is currently taking on very dramatic dimensions.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile&quot; in the attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Poland, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, is being pressured by Russia over the new U.S. missile defense base that opened in northern Poland on Nov. 13, as reported by Reuters. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also announced on Nov. 19 that key EU countries are ready to increase military and financial aid to Ukraine if the U.S. reduces its support.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-likely-used-ballistic-missile-from-kedr-complex-to-strike-dnipro-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T11:23:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2151313411.jpg
Russia plans to launch mass production of Oreshnik missile, Putin says	Russia aims to launch the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into mass production, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Nov. 22 during a meeting with the representatives of the Russian Defense Ministry and the national military-industrial complex. A day prior, Putin said in an evening address that Russian forces had used the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; to attack the city of Dnipro in Ukraine&apos;s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities have not yet provided an official report on Russia&apos;s weapon used in the recent attack. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR) suggested that this was not a new Russian design but part of Russia&apos;s Kedr missile complex that has been in development since at least 2021. Putin denied that the Oreshnik is a modernization of old Soviet systems, as the missile is allegedly based on &quot;the latest Russian developments.&quot; The Russian president added that there are no analogs of such weapons in the world, nor are there any means to intercept them. &quot;Given its striking power, especially in mass use, and combined with other high-precision long-range systems Russia also has, its use against enemy targets will be comparable to strategic weapons.

It was my first revolution' — Ukrainians look back on the Orange Revolution 20 years later	Two weeks before Ukraine&apos;s pivotal 2004 presidential election, 22-year-old filmmaker Iryna Tsilyk found herself at the center of a heated exchange during a trip to Moscow. The upcoming elections were a topic of group conversation and one Russian woman, bristling with anger, demanded, &#x201C;How dare you Ukrainians think you are independent?&#x201D; &#x201C;It was the first time in my life that I realized how much some Russians really hate the idea that we Ukrainians live in an independent country,&#x201D; Tsilyk told the Kyiv Independent. That animosity toward Ukrainian sovereignty would later come to manifest itself in the election results. Pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych was declared the winner over the pro-Western reformer Viktor Yushchenko in the Nov. 21, 2004 runoff, following widespread documented voter intimidation and electoral fraud. Outraged by the stolen election, Tsilyk and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians poured into the streets of Kyiv on the day after the election, demanding justice and a return to democratic principles. The Orange Revolution &#x2014; a two-month wave of peaceful protests, strikes, and sit-ins centered in Kyiv &#x2014; ultimately forced a new vote. Yushchenko triumphed, signaling a victory for Ukraine&#x2019;s democratic aspirations. &#x201C;It was a turning point when Ukrainians, myself included, understood that if we are united, we have the power to bring about positive change in our country,&#x201D; Tsilyk said. Twenty years after the Orange Revolution, as Ukrainians continue to resist Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war of aggression, many are looking back on the anniversary of that uprising as the first battle in their enduring fight for the nation&#x2019;s independence. The 2004 presidential election that sparked the Orange Revolution was perhaps the most heated election in Ukraine&#x2019;s recent history. Sitting President Leonid Kuchma, whose time in office had been overshadowed by a high level of corruption and events like the brutal murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, threw his support behind Yanukovych&#x2019;s candidacy as a continuation of the status quo. A wave of televised political smear campaigns attempting to portray Yushchenko as a fascist, coupled with his shocking poisoning in September 2004, defined the fraught lead-up to the initial vote. For many Ukrainians, all this underscored the high stakes of the election. Six weeks before the election, Yanukovych updated his campaign platform to include proposals for dual citizenship, elevating Russian to the status of a second state language, and rejecting NATO membership. On top of that, Russian leader Vladimir Putin arrived in Kyiv under the pretense of celebrating the anniversary of Ukraine&#x2019;s Soviet liberation from the Nazis on Oct. 28, but it soon became clear that he had other intentions, as he made a return visit leading up to the runoff vote. People shout during a celebration at Maidan Nezalezhnosti Square (Independence Square) as Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, the 50-year-old hero of the &quot;Orange Revolution,&quot; arrives there after an inaugural ceremony in the Parliament in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Jan. 23 , 2005. (Yuri Kadobnov /AFP via Getty Images)Supporters of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko in Kyiv, Ukraine on Dec. 3, 2004. (Sergei Supinsky / AFP via Getty Images)Appearing on Ukrainian national television, Putin tried to make it appear that he had no preferred candidate. He talked about how much he liked the Ukrainian language, poorly recited lines from 19th century national poet Taras Shevchenko&#x2019;s pivotal work &#x201C;Kobzar,&#x201D; and told Ukrainians to &#x201C;vote for the candidate they liked.&#x201D; But it was clear that Moscow favored Yanukovych as the next president of Ukraine, and the Yuschenko campaign publicly accused Putin of foreign election interference. In Kharkiv, Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest city, English teacher and interpreter Hennadii Tsupin recalled seeing people putting up posters with Yuschenko sporting a Hitler mustache as well as posters of Ukraine divided between East and West. &#x201C;We could also see that the nomenklatura &#x2014; employees of the state &#x2014; were ordered to support Yanukovych. Teachers and doctors, because they are paid by the state budget, were forced to attend meetings in support of Yanukovych. Workers of the state-owned enterprises, too,&#x201D; Tsupin said. When Yuschenko had come earlier in 2004 to visit Kharkiv with the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, some pro-Yanukovych agitators were waving the Russian flag and shouting angrily at Yuschenko supporters. The police had to separate them, and there was &#x201C;a lot of passion and anger in the air.&#x201D; Tsupin didn&apos;t consider himself an active participant in the Orange Revolution when it started, as he remained in Kharkiv, but he did his part to be an informed citizen during the election. He tied an orange ribbon to his Lada, the color of Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign. He also went to Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign headquarters and got some campaign stickers to distribute around the city. &#x201C;Because I am 1.90 meters (6 foot 2) I could stick them quite high up on metal posts, out of reach of Yushchenko haters,&#x201D; he recalled. When Yanukovych garnered 39.3% of the vote and Yushchenko 39.8%, the run-off vote was triggered, as presidential candidates needed to secure more than 50% of the vote to win. Journalist Olga Tokariuk was a 19-year-old university student in Kyiv during the 2004 election when she and three of her friends volunteered to work as election observers on behalf of Yuschenko&#x2019;s campaign during the Nov. 21 runoff vote. When asked where they would prefer to serve, their answer was simple: &quot;Anywhere.&quot; They were sent to Luhansk Oblast, having been told that &quot;nobody wanted to go there.&quot; The group arrived in Stanytsia Luhanska, a town that is under Russian occupation today. Tokariuk recalled how local residents were kind toward the outsiders and engaged in conversation with them in Ukrainian. At the polling station, Tokariuk witnessed firsthand how pro-Yanukovych people were trying to stuff the ballots. Election observers in support of Yanukovych&#x2019;s campaign also forced out pro-Yushchenko observers across numerous polling stations, Tokariuk among them, so they couldn&#x2019;t register any violations. &#x201C;It was really shocking how well-coordinated it all was,&#x201D; she told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;Almost all of our observers were expelled.&#x201D; &#x201C;Some of them were even taken to the forests with a sack put over their heads, intimidated, threatened with automatic weapons. Those elections were absolutely not free and transparent. We saw it with our own eyes.&#x201D; Returning from Luhasnk to Kyiv after observing the election fraud and voter intimidation in the runoff, Tokariuk and other election observers discussed their concerns over the experience. Exit polls suggested that Yuschenko had secured 52% of the run-off vote and Yanukovych only 43%, but the next morning, the Central Election Commission declared Yanukovych the winner by 2.5%. &#x201C;We decided that we had to do something,&#x201D; Tokariuk said. &#x201C;We soon learned that a lot of people had the same idea.&#x201D; An estimated 500,000 people gathered in central Kyiv in the days following the election results, many coming from cities across Ukraine to take part in the Orange Revolution. &quot;On the first day after the victory was declared for Yanukovych, I knew that I had to be there,&#x201D; said Khrystia Vengryniuk, who was a 17-year-old university student in the western city of Chernivtsi. Like many of her fellow Ukrainians, she understood that the election results had been rigged. &quot;I told my classmates that all of us needed to be there, not in class, because our future depended on it,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;There were a few other like-minded students in my group, and we stood on the central square in Chernivtsi. Later, we traveled to Kyiv to join (other protesters on) the Maidan.&quot; Vengryniuk had only brought her autumn coat with her to Kyiv but she was determined to stand on the central square day and night despite the cold. &#x201C;I had to fight for what I believed in,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It felt like everything in Ukraine would finally be okay, that we were breaking away from Russia for good.&#x201D; Tsilyk and her friends also took part in the Orange Revolution from the very first days. &#x201C;We got creative coordinating orange in our outfits,&#x201D; Tsilyk said, referring to the color of Yushchenko&#x2019;s campaign that later came to symbolize the revolution. The streets of Kyiv were a sea of orange. &#x201C;The entire atmosphere was vibrant and festive &#x2014; people were singing and chanting pro-Yushchenko slogans.&#x201D; Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko surround the parliament building in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 27, 2004. (Uriel Sinai/Getty Images)Despite the frigid weather and the high stakes of the protests, many Ukrainians remember the Orange Revolution as a largely peaceful, even celebratory moment. In stark contrast to the EuroMaidan Revolution, also known as Revolution of Dignity, a decade later, which saw over 100 protesters killed by the security forces of then-President Yanukovych, the Orange Revolution remained remarkably nonviolent. &#x201C;The biggest difference between the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity was that we actually felt safe,&#x201D; Tsilyk said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t recall ever feeling a sense of impending danger during that time.&#x201D; Many protesters also looked for ways to use their skills to support the revolution. As a journalism student, Tokariuk helped deliver a newspaper produced three times a day for the demonstrators who had gathered from all over the country. With no social media and few smartphones at the time, providing access to reliable information was essential. &#x201C;I was shouting, &#x2018;Latest news! Latest news!&#x2019; just like how newspapers were delivered in the old days,&#x201D; Tokariuk recalled. &#x201C;It felt incredible to be among the people, seeing how genuine our efforts were and how many had traveled from all over Ukraine to defend their choice (of Yuschenko). It was my first revolution. For many of us, it was our first experience of standing up for democracy.&#x201D; Ukraine&apos;s Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 3 that the election results could not be validated due to documented fraud, thereby annulling the results and triggering a second runoff vote. Under the watchful eye of both domestic and international election monitors, Ukrainians returned to the polls for a third time on Dec. 26. The Central Election Committee announced that Yuschenko had earned 51.99% of the vote and Yanukovych 44.20%. Yanukovych&#x2019;s inauguration as president occurred on Jan. 23, 2005, marking the end of the Orange Revolution. Vengryniuk recalled that the crowd was so massive at Yuschenko&#x2019;s inauguration that she began to worry that she would be crushed. Her friend&#x2019;s father helped move her through the swarms of people to a place where she could catch some air. &#x201C;Later, all of us &#x2014; adults and university students who had come together &#x2014; drank wine and pomegranate juice to regain our strength because the crowd had been so overwhelming,&#x201D; she said. Yushchenko would go on to face numerous challenges during his presidency, including infighting with political rivals and interference from powerful oligarchs whose influence he had hoped to subdue. The 2008 global financial crisis further compounded these setbacks in effective policy-making, as well as ongoing gas disputes with Russia, deepening his unpopularity among Ukrainians. During this period, Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions planned their political comeback. &#x201C;Unfortunately, Russian propaganda was incredibly strong back then, and people voted for Yanukovych the next time around. I still believe Yushchenko was a good president, though &#x2014; second only to Petro Poroshenko,&#x201D; Vengryniuk said. Yanukovych won against Yuschenko&#x2019;s prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election, and Ukrainians, as Vengryniuk lamented, &#x201C;had no idea what Ukraine would still have to endure in the years to come.&#x201D; Nevertheless, the Orange Revolution served as a crucial moment of political awakening for those involved.

(Mladen Antonov / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;The Orange Revolution helped me realize freedom and democracy are not free,&#x201D; Tokariuk said. &#x201C;They need to be protected and people need to defend their right to have free and fair elections.&#x201D; The success of the Orange Revolution also equipped many Ukrainians who participated with the resolve needed to face future challenges, including the Revolution of Dignity, the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the invasion of Donetsk and Luhansk a decade later, as well as Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war that erupted in 2022. &#x201C;Back then, I was overcome by this beautiful feeling that I am Ukrainian and we Ukrainians can do anything,&#x201D; Tsilyk said. &#x201C;Facing even bigger challenges today, I still carry this feeling with me today.&#x201D; Hi, this is Kate Tsurkan, thanks for reading this article. It was really empowering to hear from Ukrainians about their political awakening two decades ago and how that moment of triumph helped them brace for the hard times that would later come.

Ukraine to receive $4.8 billion from World Bank	Ukraine and the World Bank signed a loan agreement worth $4.8 billion, which Kyiv will use for priority budget expenditures, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and the World Bank&apos;s Eastern Europe Operations Manager Kevin Tomlinson signed the agreement for the loan on Nov. 22, which falls under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance (PEACE) project. As the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion continues to put pressure on Ukraine&apos;s economy, the World Bank plays a crucial role in supporting the country. The agreement provides for financial assistance from the U.S. and other partners. The U.S. government provides funding through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and in coordination with the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and State. The funds are then transferred to Ukraine&apos;s State Budget within the PEACE project and have gone primarily to the payment of pensions for the elderly, grants to internally displaced persons, and wages for teachers, first responders and emergency services staff. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, about $35.5 billion has already been allocated through the PEACE project to support social expenditures of Ukraine&apos;s State Budget, Ukraine&apos;s Finance Ministry said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-receive-4-8-billion-from-world-bank/	2024-11-22T10:02:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1243546154.jpeg

Nearly 580,000 Russian troops fighting against Ukraine, military intelligence says	Russia&apos;s ground forces participating in combat against Ukraine amount to almost 580,000 soldiers, Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence agency (HUR), told Interfax Ukraine on Nov. 21. Russia has been looking to increase the number of personnel to fight its war against Ukraine. The Russian government&apos;s recently exempted defendants from criminal liability if they join the Russian army and introduced additional financial rewards for contract service to shore up more manpower. Skibitskyi clarified that the number of Russian troops includes those serving in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast as they fight off Ukraine&apos;s incursion into the area, Interfax Ukraine reported. About 60,000 Russian military personnel are currently serving in Kursk, Suspilne reported previously, citing its undisclosed source in the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces. Skibitskyi added that a grouping of almost 35,000 Russian Guard troops, also known as Rosgvardia, was also deployed to the Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in June that nearly 700,000 Russian troops were fighting in Ukraine. In October, Russian casualties amounted to 600,000 since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to Pentagon estimates. The figure came at a particularly deadly stage of the war for Russian troops. According to reports from the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces, September was the second-most lethal month for Russian soldiers since February 2022. As casualties climb, Russian forces continue to press on in eastern Ukraine, focusing on the cities of Pokrovsk and Toretsk in Donetsk Oblast. Outnumbered and outgunned, Ukrainian soldiers are slowly losing ground under Russian pressure.	https://kyivindependent.com/nearly-580-000-russian-troops-engaged-in-combat-against-ukraine-military-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T08:27:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/03/GettyImages-1239919502-1.jpg
Russia likely used ballistic missile from 'Kedr' complex to strike Dnipro, intelligence says	The ballistic missile launched by Russia on Nov. 21 against the city of Dnipro was likely part of the &quot;Kedr&quot; missile complex tested in recent years, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) said. Several companies part of the Russian military-industrial complex were involved in developing &quot;Kedr,&quot; which was tested at the Kapustin Yar test site in 2023 and 2024, HUR said on Nov. 22. HUR&apos;s statement comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his televised address to the nation on Nov. 21 that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; The missile was launched at Dnipro from Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and covered nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) in 15 minutes, according to HUR. The missile was equipped with six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. The speed on the final section of the missile&apos;s trajectory was over Mach (&#x41C;) 11. At a temperature of 15&#xB0;C (59&#xB0;F), the speed of 1 M in the atmosphere is 1,225 kilometers per hour (716 miles per hour). &quot;It is an experimental system. Let&apos;s just say it&apos;s a medium-range ballistic missile. It is a carrier of nuclear weapons. The fact that they used it in a non-nuclear version is, as they (Russians) say, a warning from them that they have not gone completely crazy,&quot; military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said at an event on Nov. 22. Budanov called Russia&apos;s latest development &quot;a prototype,&quot; adding that it is not currently in mass production. Russian media circulated information about the development of a missile system called &quot;Kedr&quot; in 2021, labeling it &quot;a new-generation strategic complex.&quot; Initial reports by Ukrainian authorities suggested that Russia had test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile to target Dnipro. Later that evening, Putin said the new &quot;Oreshnik&quot; IRBM had allegedly been used. Little is known about the &quot;Oreshnik&quot; missile referred to by Putin, but military expert Yan Matveev told Russian independent media outlet IStories that it could be a modified version of the &quot;Rubezh&quot; ICBM. The RS-26 &quot;Rubezh&quot; is reported to have a range of up to 6,000 kilometers and can carry four warheads, each with an estimated payload of 0.3 megatons.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-likely-used-ballistic-missile-from-kedr-complex-to-strike-against-dnipro-on-nov-21-intelligence-says/	2024-11-22T08:16:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2006245916.jpg
Opinion: Berlin's coalition drama puts Ukraine — and Europe — at risk	Donald Trump&#x2019;s re-election has sent political shockwaves across the Atlantic, pushing Germany &#x2014; Ukraine&#x2019;s second-largest donor &#x2014; into a decisive moment. The election has intensified internal divides and sparked a reckoning over Germany&#x2019;s role in European security. For years, German leaders deferred tough decisions on Ukraine, relying on U.S. leadership to navigate international crises. But Trump&#x2019;s isolationist rhetoric and unpredictable foreign policy have disrupted that balance, forcing Berlin to confront its priorities. The fallout has already upended Germany&#x2019;s ruling coalition, setting the stage for early elections in February. At the heart of this crisis is a budgetary impasse that exposes deep divisions within Germany&#x2019;s coalition government over how to address economic stagnation, inflation, and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. Trump&#x2019;s victory raised urgent questions about Germany&#x2019;s capacity &#x2014; and willingness &#x2014; to lead Europe in the face of Russian aggression. Germany&#x2019;s recent political turmoil stems from a long-standing constitutional constraint: the &#x201C;debt brake,&#x201D; which limits public borrowing. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens, part of the country&#x2019;s ruling coalition, pushed for loosening these rules to counter economic stagnation and fund critical programs, including aid for Ukraine. The fiscally conservative Free Democrats (FDP), the coalition&#x2019;s third component, resisted, insisting on strict adherence to fiscal discipline. While the coalition eventually agreed to breach the debt brake under extraordinary circumstances &#x2014; such as a dramatic escalation in Ukraine &#x2014; Trump&#x2019;s return tipped the scales. His re-election reignited fears of a more isolationist U.S., prompting Chancellor Olaf Scholz to frame Trump&#x2019;s victory as a &#x201C;fundamental change&#x201D; that demanded increased military and financial commitments to Ukraine. Yet, these proposals met resistance from the FDP, which suggested alternative funding mechanisms, such as using frozen Russian assets. The standoff proved insurmountable, leading to the coalition&#x2019;s collapse. Scholz has consistently emphasized Germany&#x2019;s 30 billion euros ($31.7 billion) in aid to Ukraine, framing the support as vital for both European security and long-term stability. &#x201C;A Russian victory would cost us much more,&#x201D; he asserted in a televised address following the coalition&#x2019;s collapse. However, his actions often fell short of his rhetoric. Over the past two years, Germany&#x2019;s contributions to Ukraine &#x2014; including tanks, air defense systems, and humanitarian aid &#x2014; have been incremental and politically contentious. Key military systems, like Taurus missiles, remain undelivered despite growing calls for stronger support. Public opinion has also shifted. Far-left and far-right voices now question the cost of the war, advocating negotiations with Russia. Parties like the far-left B&#xFC;ndnis Sarah Wagenknecht and the far-right Alternative f&#xFC;r Deutschland (AfD) have gained traction, particularly in economically weaker regions, by appealing to voters frustrated with rising gas prices and prolonged military involvement. Meanwhile, Germany&#x2019;s mainstream parties have struggled to articulate a clear endgame for the war or its broader implications.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s re-election has thrust Germany into an uncomfortable spotlight, forcing it to reassess its reliance on U.S. leadership. For Ukrainians, who have tirelessly campaigned for German military support, this moment feels both urgent and uncertain. Activists continue to demand the delivery of advanced systems, like the Taurus missile, which could change the trajectory of the war. Yet Germany&#x2019;s hesitancy remains, with many decisions still tied to Washington&#x2019;s lead. The upcoming February elections could mark a decisive shift. Conservatives, currently leading in polls, have signaled stronger support for Ukraine, including commitments to deliver more military aid if Russian attacks on civilians persist. However, there&#x2019;s a catch: If the SPD joins the next government as a junior coalition partner, its pacifist leanings could again temper Germany&#x2019;s response at a critical juncture. Even within the SPD, opinions are evolving. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius recently acknowledged that Germany must become &#x201C;ready for war,&#x201D; signaling a potential shift in the party&#x2019;s stance. Yet Scholz&#x2019;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin &#x2014; criticized by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as &#x201C;opening Pandora&#x2019;s box&#x201D; &#x2014; underscores the precariousness of Germany&#x2019;s position. Trump&#x2019;s return to power has exposed Germany&#x2019;s vulnerabilities and its dependence on American leadership. The collapse of its coalition government is both a symptom and a consequence of these pressures, as economic, political, and geopolitical challenges collide. Germany now faces a stark choice: step into a leadership role in supporting Ukraine or remain reactive, paralyzed by internal divisions and external unpredictability. The February elections will be pivotal in determining Germany&#x2019;s future course. While a conservative-led government could bring renewed vigor to Ukraine&#x2019;s cause, the specter of continued SPD influence looms large. For Europe, this moment demands bold action and a departure from past hesitations. For Germany, it&#x2019;s an opportunity to define its legacy &#x2014; not as a reluctant actor, but as a leader shaping a new chapter for Ukraine and Europe.

Opinion: With soaring interest rates and stagflation risks, Russia will face deep economic crisis regardless of war’s outcome	The recent hike in Russia&#x2019;s key interest rate to 21% by the Central Bank in late October has stirred renewed debate among media and economists about the Russian economy&#x2019;s outlook and how economic trends could influence Kremlin policies. Today, few predict an &quot;imminent collapse&quot; of the Russian economy. However, signs of deteriorating trends and economic challenges confront Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime with a dilemma: continuing the aggressive war or quickly ending it are both likely to lead to an economic crisis. Observers point out several unique features of the Russian economy that cast doubt on claims of its &quot;sustainable development&quot; and &quot;prosperity.&quot; First, the current key rate is more than double the official annual inflation rate, resulting in a double-digit real interest rate &#x2014; an unusual scenario. This could suggest that actual inflation is much higher than official reports indicate and that inflation expectations among the public and businesses exceed the Russian Central Bank&apos;s estimates (over 13%). Even if official inflation figures aren&#x2019;t distorted, the calculation methods don&#x2019;t account for changes in the consumer basket due to sanctions, such as the replacement of Western goods with cheaper Chinese alternatives. Second, despite the high interest rate, loan volume continues to grow, as noted by Elvira Nabiullina, governor of the Bank of Russia &#x2014; a concern for the central bank. Credit growth is currently driven by increased business lending, while consumer lending has declined in response to high rates and the end of the subsidized &#x201C;preferential&#x201D; mortgage program in summer 2024. Commercial lending rates have risen to 25&#x2013;30% and above, signaling heightened inflation expectations, a shortage of working capital due to increased sanctions-related costs, and labor shortages. These factors create significant risks of defaults and bankruptcies. Third, the planned increase in budget spending for 2025 significantly exceeds even optimistic GDP growth projections. The Russian government has forecast real GDP growth at 2.5% for 2025. However, even Russian analysts suggest growth will likely not exceed 2%, and the International Monetary Fund recently lowered its 2025 forecast to 1.3%. Meanwhile, planned federal expenditures are set to rise by nearly 12% (from 37.2 trillion rubles in 2024 to 41.5 trillion in 2025). Direct military spending for 2025 is expected to reach an unprecedented 13.5 trillion rubles (about $140 billion). Even within Russia, economists doubt that the government&#x2019;s projected budget deficit of under 1% of GDP is realistic. This is reflected in declining liquid assets in the so-called &quot;National Wealth Fund,&quot; which, as of summer 2024, stood at just over $55 billion &#x2014; less than half of what it was at the start of the full scale war in 2022. The revival of the Russian economy in 2023&#x2013;24 is attributed to two main factors: stable oil and gas revenues and significant growth in war-related government spending. Despite sanctions, Russia has found new markets (mainly China and India), and has employed a &#x201C;shadow fleet&#x201D; and other strategies to evade sanctions. However, both the Russian Central Bank and the Russian parliament are now warning of stagflation (recession combined with high inflation). Resources are dwindling, fiscal stimuli are no longer effective, supply-side constraints (labor shortages and lack of access to technology and modern equipment) are intensifying, and production cannot keep up with demand, driving inflation. This trajectory will likely lead to a severe economic crisis; the only question is when. Ending the war also carries significant risks for the Russian economy. Exiting the &quot;Keynesian trap&quot; of increased budget expenditures will be painful, as a decrease in aggregate demand could worsen stagflation tendencies and trigger a major downturn and crisis.

(Alexander Kazakov / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)Over the course of the war, a significant &#x201C;war party&#x201D; has formed in Russia, involving both elites and ordinary citizens. Officials have gained new avenues for corrupt enrichment through sanctions circumvention schemes, while businesses have filled market gaps left by Western companies. Families of soldiers or those working directly or indirectly for the military-industrial complex are earning incomes they couldn&#x2019;t have imagined pre-war. By various estimates, direct war beneficiaries include 15 million people or more, comprising over 10% of the Russian population. Additionally, increased payouts in the contract army and military-adjacent sectors, coupled with an obvious labor shortage, have driven up wages in other parts of the economy. Though public opinion polls indicate broad support for the war, it&#x2019;s evident that the conflict has allowed a sizable portion of the population to escape the &quot;poverty trap.&quot; A return to pre-war conditions and the end of war-related expenditures will inevitably trigger an economic crisis and heightened social tension. By launching the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian regime set itself up for a dilemma in which both continuing and ending the war will almost certainly lead to an economic &#x2014; and possibly political &#x2014; crisis. Given this, it seems prudent for Ukraine&#x2019;s allies to make Russia&#x2019;s continued aggression significantly more painful. Enhancing sanctions to meaningfully reduce Russia&#x2019;s export revenues and restricting imports of critical technologies and equipment would serve this goal. The problem is not that sanctions &#x201C;don&#x2019;t work&#x201D; but that they&#x2019;ve been applied slowly and inconsistently, with enforcement often lacking. Sometimes, sanctions inadvertently benefit Russia; for example, capital outflow restrictions have consolidated capital domestically, providing Putin&#x2019;s regime with additional resources. A better approach would be to encourage the maximum outflow of capital &#x2014; including financial and human resources &#x2014; by avoiding restrictions on emigration opportunities for Russians opposing the regime. By intensifying sanctions and closing enforcement loopholes, the prospects for Russia&#x2019;s &#x201C;celebration&#x201D; of a prolonged, low-cost war will be sharply reduced, far below the five years or more predicted by a recent analysis in The Economist.

War in Ukraine at 'decisive stage,' risk of 'global conflict,' Poland's Tusk says	The war in Ukraine has reached a &quot;decisive phase,&quot; and the latest events demonstrate the real threat of a &quot;global conflict,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Nov. 22. Tusk&apos;s comments came in the wake of Russia&apos;s attack on Dnipro a day earlier, in which Moscow claims a new missile, an intermediate-range ballistic missile (ICBM) called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; was tested. Speaking at the Congress of the Polish Teachers&apos; Union, Tusk referred to what he called &quot;the events of the last dozen hours&quot; as demonstrating there is a &quot;serious and real threat of global conflict.&quot; &quot;It would be hard for me not to say a few fundamental words today about the situation, because it is historic,&quot; he said in comments reported by Polish outlet Radio Zet. &quot;The war in the east is entering its decisive phase. We all know it. We feel that the unknown is approaching. None of us knows the end of this conflict, but we know that it is currently taking on very dramatic dimensions.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile&quot; in the attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Poland, one of Ukraine&apos;s staunchest supporters, is being pressured by Russia over the new U.S. missile defense base that opened in northern Poland on Nov. 13, as reported by Reuters. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski also announced on Nov. 19 that key EU countries are ready to increase military and financial aid to Ukraine if the U.S. reduces its support.	https://kyivindependent.com/war-in-ukraine-at-decisive-stage-risk-of-global-conflict-polands-tusk-says/	2024-11-22T06:48:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2183928589.jpg
Belarus Weekly: New Russian military doctrine to cover Belarus with nuclear umbrella	Belarus&#x2019; authorities are on full alert ahead of upcoming presidential elections in January 2025, new wave of police raids target relatives of political prisoners. Belarusian police conduct counter-protest drills to prevent &#x201C;manifestations of extremism and terrorism&#x201D; during the election campaign. Russia&#x2019;s military doctrine was updated, covering Belarus with a Russian nuclear umbrella. No change in the U.S. nuclear posture. Polish broadcaster TVP appoints new leadership to flagship Belarusian-language channel Belsat amid heated debate over the channel&apos;s independence and future. Record 49 Russian Shahed-type drones entered Belarus&#x2019;s airspace in October, Belarusian Hajun monitoring group reports. The Belarusian authorities have launched another wave of raids and arrests across the country ahead of the presidential elections scheduled for Jan. 26, 2025, targeting political prisoners&#x2019; relatives, human rights activists reported on Nov. 15. Since the previous presidential elections in 2020, which sparked nationwide protests, over 3,500 individuals have been recognized as political prisoners by human rights organizations. Nearly 1,300 of them remain behind bars. Over the four-year-long crackdown on dissent in Belarus, 65,000 people have been subjected to politically motivated persecution. Belarus&#x2019;s KGB security agency unleashed a new round of raids on Nov. 14, targeting the relatives of political prisoners in the country&#x2019;s Hrodna and Brest regions, and in the capital Minsk, according to reports by human rights groups Viasna, Dissidentby, and the &#x201C;Country to Live In&#x201D; foundation. The raids constitute the third attack in a &#x201C;terror campaign&#x201D; this autumn, potentially targeting several hundred people, says Andrei Stryzhak, the head of Solidarity Foundation BYSOL, a group helping to evacuate dissidents from Belarus and assisting those suffering from persecution in the country. The activist said the raids were occurring against the backdrop of an &#x201C;imaginary thaw&#x201D; in relations between the regime and its opponents, coinciding with the release of 31 political prisoners and the permitting by the authorities of a family visit to Maria Kalesnikava, a prominent opposition leader who had been held incommunicado for over 600 days. According to BYSOL&#x2019;s leader, this round of repression has hit the northern Belarusian regions of Polatsk and Navapolatsk. With the rapid approach of the presidential election, to be held ahead of schedule on Jan. 26, 2025, the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has launched a &#x201C;pre-election intimidation campaign,&#x201D; human rights activists from the Viasna Center report. Belarusian police are to conduct exercises in Minsk and regional centers to ensure &#x201C;the prevention of manifestations of extremism and terrorism&#x201D; ahead of the January presidential elections, the Interior Ministry announced on Nov. 19. The 2025 Belarusian presidential elections, scheduled for Jan. 26, are intended to extend the rule of the country&#x2019;s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, for a seventh consecutive term in office. The previous presidential race sparked protests nationwide after the pro-Lukashenko Central Elections Committee announced his victory amid widespread claims of vote rigging. The police drills, which were scheduled to take place between Nov. 19 and 22, were to &#x201C;demonstrate the readiness&#x201D; of the police to respond to possible &#x201C;complications of the situation in the country during the election campaign.&#x201D; The exercises involve practicing street closures, and using smoke, flash and gas bombs and special equipment to disperse protests. &#x201C;The goal (of the exercises) ... is to prevent manifestations of extremism and terrorism, the involvement of citizens in illegal actions, and the suppression of violations of public order,&#x201D; the Interior Ministry said in a post on its official Telegram channel. A video accompanying the post shows the detention of alleged offenders, scenes from a polling station, and shots of riot police countering groups of people with placards. Belarus Security Council Secretary Alexander Volfovich said the exercises were routine ones, but claimed that exiled opponents of the Lukashenko regime &#x201C;are using all levers and opportunities to try to sway the situation again.&#x201D; Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian opposition leader who claimed to have beaten Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, said the exercises were intended to intimidate the opposition. &#x201C;Training to suppress citizens isn&#x2019;t a sign of strength &#x2013; it&#x2019;s a sign of fear,&#x201D; she wrote on X. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed Russia&#x2019;s updated nuclear doctrine, providing for nuclear retaliation in the case of armed aggression against Belarus, according to a presidential decree published on the government website on Nov. 19. The revised deterrence policy suggests that &#x201C;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&#x201D; could trigger a nuclear response. The updated doctrine also considers any large-scale cross-border attack involving aircraft, missiles, or drones to be grounds for consideration of a nuclear strike. The publication of the doctrine comes on the heels of the United States giving Ukraine permission to strike targets in Russia with the U.S.-supplied long-range missiles. The White House National Security Council said that Russia&#x2019;s lowered threshold for nuclear retaliation did not come as a surprise, but also provided no reason for the United States to adjust its own nuclear posture. Putin first proposed making changes to the doctrine on Sept. 25 amid discussions in the United States and the U.K. about allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with Western-supplied long-range conventional missiles. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, an ally of the Kremlin, welcomed the inclusion of Belarus under Russia&#x2019;s nuclear umbrella, saying it was &#x201C;long overdue.&#x201D; &#x201C;An attack on Belarus is World War III,&#x201D; Lukashenko said on Sept. 27, alleging NATO countries were deploying troops at the border with Belarus. Although a non-nuclear state, Belarus reportedly has Russian nuclear weapons deployed on its territory following the signing of the agreement on May 25, 2023 on placing Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Lukashenko also attended Russian nuclear military drills, during a sudden inspection of the country&#x2019;s tactical nuclear weapons launchers in May 2024. Forty-nine Russian Shahed-type combat drones entered Belarus&#x2019;s airspace in October &#x2014; the highest number recorded in a month, the Belarusian Hajun war monitoring project wrote. Russian Shahed-type drones began to cross regularly into Belarus in July this year, with Ukraine reportedly using electronic warfare measures to send the drones off course. Amid intensified attacks against Ukraine in subsequent months, incursions of Russian drones into Belarus surged from infrequent, isolated instances to 27 stray drones being spotted over Belarus in September. Throughout October, 33 stray drones returned from Belarus to Ukrainian territory, while the location of 14 was lost, according to the monitoring group. One drone crashed in Kalinkavichy, roughly 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, overnight on Oct. 3, after three Shahed drones flew into Belarusian airspace. Lukashenko was traveling by helicopter over the country at the time of the drone incursion. Another UAV was downed by the Belarusian Air Force over the country&#x2019;s Homel Oblast overnight on Oct. 20. It was the second instance of the Belarusian military downing a Russian UAV since the incursions began. &#x201C;At the moment, there is no reason to believe that Russian UAVs of the Shahed-136/131 type will stop flying into Belarus in the near future,&#x201D; Belarusian Hajun said in its report. Lukashenko claimed on Oct. 4 that the Belarusian Air Force downs &#x201C;a lot of drones,&#x201D; both Russian and Ukrainian, and attributed the incursions to the work of radio-electronic warfare equipment and mistakes by drone operators. No proof of Ukrainian drones entering Belarusian airspace has ever been presented. Minsk, Russia&#x2019;s staunchest ally, has never publicly raised objections with Moscow over the reported drone incidents. Polish Public Broadcaster TVP has appointed new leadership to its flagship broadcaster for Belarus, Belsat, in a move to integrate the exiled Belarusian-language television channel into its Center for Foreign Language Programs &#x2013; despite calls for Belsat&#x2019;s operations to remain independent. On Nov. 15, TVP appointed Alina Koushyk, a former anchor and producer at Belsat, as the head of the Belarusian editorial office. Koushyk, who had left Belsat two years ago for a role in Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya&#x2019;s shadow cabinet, said, &#x201C;We aimed to advocate for Belsat to remain an independent channel, but unfortunately, our efforts did not succeed.&#x201D; The merger comes amid broader restructuring of Poland&#x2019;s state media following the defeat of the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party in the 2023 parliamentary elections, with the new government saying it was seeking to &#x201C;restore impartiality&#x201D; to TVP. The restructuring implies Belsat&#x2019;s formerly separate airtime will be split into three sections &#x2013; six hours each for Belarusian-language programming, the Russia-focused news channel Vot Tak, and a Ukrainian-language broadcaster that has yet to be formed. Koushyk replaces Aleksy Dzikawicki, a co-founder and acting director of Belsat, who on Nov. 19 requested that his contract be terminated. Dzikawicki said he had requested early dismissal to avoid having to carry out an order to formally liquidate Belsat as an independent entity within TVP. Belsat started broadcasting in 2007 as the first Belarusian-language TV channel, offering coverage in the Belarusian language, which has been gradually excluded from Belarusian public life by the Lukashenko regime. Belarus is low in the press freedom rating, ranking 157th among 180 countries in 2023. Almost no independent media are left in Belarus due to the Lukashenko regime&#x2019;s efforts to stamp out a free press, which have seen 40 media professionals prosecuted, outlets being branded as &#x201C;extremist,&#x201D; and punishments introduced for sharing &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; content. The potential downsizing of Belsat to only one of several editorial offices within the Center for Foreign Language Programs has drawn criticism from Belarusian opposition leaders. However, TVP World director and editor-in-chief Micha&#x142; Broniatowski has denied that Belsat will lose its independence after the merger, saying &#x201C;Belsat&#x2019;s editorial office will be fully Belarusian, there will be no &#x2018;orders&#x2019; to cover what the Foreign Ministry wants, or not to cover what it does not want covered.&#x201D; In March, Belsat, lost 47% of its total financing from the Foreign Ministry and Poland&#x2019;s TVP, and its longtime director, Agnieszka Romaszewska-Guzy, was dismissed. The International Press Institute (IPI) has urged Poland&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry to reconsider the decision, warning of the &#x201C;disastrous impact&#x201D; on the accessibility of independent Belarusian news. While acknowledging Poland&#x2019;s financial burden, the IPI called for measures to ensure Belsat&#x2019;s survival as a vital platform for European security. The restructuring is set to be finalized on March 1, 2025.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-new-russian-military-doctrine-to-cover-belarus-with-nuclear-umbrella/	2024-11-22T04:46:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1798032839.jpg
North Korea received anti-aircraft missiles, oil from Russia in exchange for troops, reports say	Russia gave North Korea oil and anti-aircraft missiles in return for military support in Ukraine, according to a South Korean official, and satellite imagery analysis. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in the western Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12. South Korea&apos;s national security advisor Shin Won-sik on Nov. 22 said Moscow had provided Pyongyang with economic and military technology in exchange for the troops. &quot;It is understood that North Korea has been provided with related equipment and anti-aircraft missiles to strengthen Pyongyang&apos;s weak air defense system,&quot; Shin said in an interview with South Korea&#x2019;s SBS News. Elsewhere, the BBC on Nov. 22 reported that Russia is estimated to have supplied North Korea with more than a million barrels of oil since March this year. The claim was based on an analysis of satellite imagery by the Open Source Centre, a non-profit research group based in the U.K. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the BBC that the oil is payment for weapons and troops sent to Moscow to fuel the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership agreement in June. Under the treaty, the two countries pledge to help each other if either is attacked. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui visited Moscow and met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Nov. 4. &quot;Our country will stand firmly by our Russian comrades until the day of victory,&quot; Choe said, calling Moscow&apos;s offensive against Ukraine a &quot;sacred struggle.&quot; Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., claimed that the direct involvement of Russia&apos;s allies such as North Korea in the war against Ukraine was evidence of a global conflict.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korea-received-anti-aircraft-missiles-oil-from-russia-in-exchange-for-troops-reports-say/	2024-11-22T03:41:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157652819.jpg
Shahed drones that hit Sumy equipped with shrapnel munitions, regional governor says	Russian Shahed-type drones that attacked Sumy overnight were equipped with shrapnel munitions, Regional Governor Volodymyr Artiukh reported on Nov. 22. Russia struck a residential area in the city killing two people and injuring 12, according to local officials. &quot;These weapons are used to kill people. Not to destroy structures, just to kill more people,&quot; Artiukh said in a video uploaded to the Sumy Regional Military Administration&apos;s Telegram channel. &quot;Just as the previous missile strike [had] cluster munitions, today again drones [are] equipped with shrapnel,&quot; he added. &quot;The same goes for other strikes, in other places where private homes were hit, people were injured and killed. This is pure genocide.&quot; The Sumy regional prosecutor&apos;s office is conducting a pre-trial investigation into potential &quot;war crimes resulting in the deaths of people.&quot; Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Residents of the vulnerable border communities experience multiple attacks per day.	https://kyivindependent.com/shahed-drones-that-hit-sumy-equipped-with-shrapnel-munitions-regional-governor-says/	2024-11-22T02:32:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-22-at-12_24_00.png
White House sees no indication of Russia preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine	The Biden administration has not seen any &quot;indications of Russia preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine,&quot; &#xA0;White House Press Secretary Karin Jean-Pierre said on Nov. 21. Speaking at a press briefing, Jean-Pierre also said the administration was &quot;not surprised by Russia&apos;s announcement that it would update its nuclear doctrine,&quot; and they believed it was &quot;irresponsible rhetoric.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the country&apos;s new nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes should be seen as a &quot;certain signal&quot; to the West. &quot;This is more of the same irresponsible rhetoric that we continue to hear from Russia, which we have seen for more than two years now, if you think about their aggression, their war against Ukraine,&quot; Jean-Pierre said. &quot;We haven&#x2019;t seen any indications of Russia preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. &#xA0;We just have not seen that. &quot;And observing no changes to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear posture, we have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture or doctrine in response to Russia&#x2019;s statements.&quot; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh on Nov. 20 also dismissed Russia&#x2019;s rhetoric surrounding its nuclear policy as a continuation of its behavior over the past two years. Since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has made a series of nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West, none of which have materialized.	https://kyivindependent.com/white-house-sees-no-indication-of-russia-preparing-to-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine/	2024-11-22T02:00:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2036341931.jpg
Russia's experimental weapons 'will not change the course of the war,’ NATO says	Russia&apos;s use of a purported new ballistic missile &quot;will not change the course of the conflict, or deter NATO allies from supporting Ukraine,&quot; NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said on Nov. 21. Dakhlallah&apos;s comments came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack on Dnipro in eastern Ukraine earlier that day. &quot;The Russian attack on Dnipro on Thursday is yet another example of Russia&apos;s attacks on Ukrainian cities,&quot; Dakhlallah said in comments reported by the Guardian and AFP. Putin said the attack was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russian oblasts using Western-supplied long-range missiles. On Nov. 17 U.S. President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. On Nov. 19, Ukraine launched ATACMS missiles for the first time in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, and on Nov. 20, it made its first use of UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. After depicting such a move as crossing another &quot;red line&quot; the Kremlin had drawn, Russian President Vladimir Putin previously said his country would respond. &quot;They probably considered testing a nuclear warhead, which was also rumored to happen soon, but decided that&apos;s too intense, and that could invite too much backlash, especially from partners, such as China and India,&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;They probably thought that (the IRBM strike) is the next best option because it sends a clear signal to the West, while potentially not antagonizing critical international partners,&quot; he added. &quot;So this strike is not for military value, this is purely, purely for political purposes.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-experimental-weapons-will-not-change-the-course-of-the-war-nato-says/	2024-11-22T01:31:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185213511.jpg
Ukrainian parliament meeting canceled due to credible threat of Russian strike in Kyiv, source confirms	A Ukrainian parliament meeting scheduled for Nov. 22 has been canceled due to the credible threat of a targeted Russian strike on government buildings in Kyiv, a Ukrainian lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent. Lawmakers were planning to hold an hour-long Q&amp;A session at the Verkhovna Rada, the source added. An air raid alert was on in Kyiv and several central and eastern oblasts in the late morning of Nov. 22 due to a reported drone threat. The development comes amid escalating tensions in Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 21 said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Putin warned that Russia would use weapons against any country whose arms are used to strike Russian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-parliament-meeting-canceled-due-to-threat-of-russian-strike-source-confirms/	2024-11-22T00:59:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
North Korea's Kim accuses US of stoking potential 'thermonuclear war'	North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Nov. 21 accused the U.S. of stoking global tensions that could escalate &quot;into the most destructive thermonuclear war.&quot; Speaking at a military exhibition in Pyongyang, Kim claimed his previous experience of negotiating with Washington had proved to him that the U.S. was &quot;aggressive and hostile&quot; towards his country. &quot;Never before have the warring parties on the Korean peninsula faced such a dangerous and acute confrontation that it could escalate into the most destructive thermonuclear war,&quot; he said in comments reported by Reuters. &quot;We have already gone as far as we can on negotiating with the United States, but what we became certain of from the result is not the superpower&apos;s willingness to coexist, but its thorough stance of power and aggressive and hostile policy toward us that can never change.&quot; Kim&apos;s comments came on the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country had launched its &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik,&quot; in an attack on Dnipro, eastern Ukraine that morning. He said the test was in response to Ukraine targeting facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range, Western-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance. Putin warned that Russia would use weapons against any country whose arms are used to strike Russian targets. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in the western Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12. Russia is mustering a force of 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, to launch a counter-offensive against a Ukrainian salient in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, the New York Times reported on Nov. 10. The new force comes as Russia saw its heaviest losses last month, and the North Korean troops could be replacing injured and killed Russian soldiers, according to some experts.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-koreas-kim-accuses-us-of-stoking-potential-thermonuclear-war/	2024-11-21T22:50:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181560378.jpg

2 killed, 12 injured in Russia's attack on Sumy	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia struck a residential area in the city of Sumy overnight on Nov. 22 with Shahed drones, killing two people and injuring 12, local authorities reported. First responders have been dispatched to the site of the attack, and rescue operations continue as of 7 a.m. local time. Sumy Oblast Military Administration did not provide further details at the time of publication. Russian strikes against Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months. Russia&apos;s overnight missile attacks on Sumy on Nov. 18 killed 11 and injured 89, including 11 children, after a ballistic missile struck a residential building. Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts.

Ukraine's former commander-in-chief says Russia’s allies’ involvement signals global conflict	Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine&apos;s former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., claimed that World War III is underway. Speaking at the Ukrainska Pravda-100 award ceremony on Nov. 20, Zaluzhnyi pointed to the direct involvement of Russia&apos;s allies in the war against Ukraine as evidence of a global conflict. &quot;I believe that in 2024, we can absolutely assume that World War III has begun,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. He emphasized that Ukraine is no longer fighting Russia alone. &quot;Ukraine is facing soldiers from North Korea. Let&apos;s be honest. Iranian-made Shaheds [loitering munitions] are killing civilians in Ukraine quite openly. It&apos;s missiles made in North Korea that are being launched onto Ukraine, and they are openly declaring this. Chinese-made shells are exploding in Ukraine, and Chinese parts are used in Russian missiles.&quot; Zaluzhnyi argued that military experts widely agree these developments signify a world war. He urged global leaders to recognize the situation and take decisive action. &quot;What we&apos;ve expected for so long has started. But I want to say that God Himself is giving a chance, not only to Ukraine but to the whole world, to have time to draw the correct conclusions now,&quot; Zaluzhnyi said. &quot;It&apos;s still possible to stop it here, on the territory of Ukraine. But for some reason, our partners do not want to understand this. It&apos;s obvious that Ukraine already has too many enemies. Ukraine will survive through technology, but it is unclear whether it can win this battle alone. So I believe that the world war has already begun.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-former-commander-in-chief-says-russias-allies-involvement-signals-global-conflict/	2024-11-21T20:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173728155.jpg
US warned Ukraine, other allies ahead of Putin's 'experimental intermediate-range ballistic' attack	Russia launched a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) against Dnipro, eastern Ukraine, on the morning of Nov. 21. A U.S. official confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that the U.S. warned Kyiv ahead of the attack that this type of weapon may be used against Ukraine. &quot;Russia likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles,&quot; the official said, adding that Ukraine has withstood countless attacks from Russia, including from missiles with significantly larger warheads than this weapon. Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed in a televised address to the nation later that day that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; The attack came in the wake of Ukraine&apos;s apparent first successful strike on a military target inside Russia using the U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. Putin said the strike was a direct response to the U.S. and the U.K. jointly approving Ukraine&#x2019;s use of Western-supplied long-range missiles to target Russia. The Russian missile targeted an industrial enterprise in the city, and two fires broke out following the attack, Governor Serhii Lysak said. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was damaged as well. At least two people are reported to have been injured. &quot;Russia may be seeking to use this capability to try to intimidate Ukraine and its supporters or generate attention in the information space, but it will not be a game-changer in this conflict,&quot; the official told the Kyiv Independent. Little is known about the &quot;Oreshnyk&quot; missile referred to by Putin, but military expert Yan Matveev told IStories that it could be a modified version of the Rubezh. The RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile is reported to have a range of up to 6,000 kilometers and can carry four warheads, each with an estimated payload of 0.3 megatons. Fabian Hoffmann, a defense expert and doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo, told the Kyiv Independent that the Rubezh is equipped with a MIRV payload, which stands for Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles. Ukraine&apos;s U.S.-supplied Patriots have been effective at intercepting the ballistic missiles launched by Russia to date, but according to Defense Express, they are not currently optimized to intercept ICBMs. If Russia began to regularly launch ICBMs, Ukraine&apos;s air defenses would need to be bolstered by more advanced air defense systems like the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense), the outlet reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-warned-ukraine-other-allies-ahead-of-putins-experimental-intermediate-range-ballistic-attack/	2024-11-21T18:36:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-21_10-53-05--3-.jpg
High-ranking North Korean general injured in Ukrainian strike on Kursk, WSJ reports	A high-ranking North Korean general was wounded in a recent Ukrainian missile strike on Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Nov. 21, citing undisclosed sources. This marked the first injury of a senior North Korean military figure confirmed by Western officials. The WSJ source noted that the attack may have targeted a command post used by Russian and North Korean forces near the Bariatinsky estate in Maryino. The general&#x2019;s identity and the circumstances of the injury remain undisclosed. North Korea has dispatched 10,000 troops to Russia, with most of them deployed in the western Kursk Oblast and taking part in combat, a Pentagon spokesperson said during a press briefing on Nov. 12.

Russia pre-notified US of 'Oreshnik' missile strike before attack on Dnipro	Russia gave the U.S. a brief advance warning of the intermediate-range ballistic missile strike on Dnipro before the attack, according to comments a U.S. administration official made at a briefing on Nov. 21. &#x201C;The United States was pre-notified briefly before the launch, through nuclear risk reduction channels,&#x201D; Defense Department Deputy Spokesperson Sabrina Singh said. The warning, sent 30 minutes before the launch, was also confirmed by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The U.S. had previously alerted Ukraine and its allies that Russia might test such an experimental missile. In the early hours of Nov. 21, a country-wide air raid alert sounded due to the threat of ballistic missiles, and later, the launch of several Russian Tu-95MS bomber aircraft. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, the attack targeted the city of Dnipro using a number of different missile types. Late on Nov. 21, Putin said in a televised address that the attack was a test of Russia&apos;s &quot;newest missile,&quot; an IRBM called &quot;Oreshnik.&quot; Russia regularly uses close, and short range ballistic missiles in aerial attacks against Ukraine, but IRBMs and ICBMs are far larger, can be equipped with nuclear payloads, and are designed to hit targets at far longer ranges.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-pre-notified-us-of-oreshnik-missile-strike-before-attack-on-dnipro/	2024-11-21T14:47:02-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228238620.jpg
UK sanctions Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash and others in anti-corruption crackdown	The U.K. has sanctioned Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, along with Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, and Latvian politician Aivars Lembergs, according to the U.K. government&#x2019;s website statement on Nov. 21. The statement noted that freezing their assets is part of a crackdown on global corruption and &quot;dirty money.&quot; Firtash allegedly laundered hundreds of millions of pounds from Ukraine and invested significant amounts of the gains in U.K. property. His wife, Lada Firtash, was also sanctioned as she &#x201C;profited from his corruption and holds UK assets on his behalf.&#x201D; Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized the sanctions as a step toward holding corrupt elites accountable for exploiting public resources. Firtash, formerly a close associate of pro-Russian ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, accumulated much of his wealth by buying Russian gas and selling it in his home country. U.S. prosecutors charged Firtash with racketeering and bribery in 2014 and he was briefly arrested in Austria before posting bail. The Ukrainian tycoon has so far avoided extradition from Austria&apos;s capital, where he resides.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-sanctions-ukrainian-oligarch-dmytro-firtash-and-others-in-anti-corruption-crackdown/	2024-11-21T13:33:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/WhatsApp-Image-2023-10-03-at-11.25.04.jpg
Recent Russian attacks hit 3 of Ukrainian energy giant DTEK's 5 operational thermal power plants, Reuters reports	Russia&#x2019;s missile strikes on Nov. 16-17 hit three of the five operational thermal power plants owned by Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, leaving one plant offline, Reuters reported on Nov. 21, citing unnamed sources. The strikes targeted energy facilities across Ukraine in one of the heaviest assaults on the country&#x2019;s power grid since the start of the full-scale war, with Russia launching approximately 120 missiles and 90 drones. DTEK reported &#x201C;heavy damage&#x201D; to its equipment following the attack, marking the eighth mass assault on its energy plants this year. According to the source, two of the damaged facilities have resumed partial electricity production, while the third remains offline. An unnamed official confirmed to Reuters that power plants and distribution stations were damaged during the Nov. 17 strikes but declined to provide specific figures on power losses, calling the information &#x201C;too sensitive.&#x201D; Ukraine reintroduced rolling blackouts on Nov. 18, with outages lasting four to eight hours at a time and occurring multiple times daily. Officials have warned that Russia may continue targeting the energy grid as winter approaches, repeating a strategy used during spring and summer and throughout the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023. In September, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian attacks had destroyed all of Ukraine&#x2019;s thermal power plants and most of its hydroelectric capacity. Ukrainian authorities and energy companies have been working to repair and reinforce the grid in anticipation of renewed attacks. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Ukraine&#x2019;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter&#x2014;around one-third of peak demand. By comparison, the summer shortage was 2.5 GW, which already resulted in prolonged blackouts in Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/recent-russian-attacks-hit-3-of-ukrainian-energy-giant-dteks-5-operational-thermal-power-plants-reuters-reports/	2024-11-21T12:22:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2147766702.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia launched new 'Oreshnik' intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine, Putin claims	Key developments on Nov. 21: Russian President Vladimir Putin said that during the Nov. 21 strike on Dnipro, Russia tested a new intermediate-range ballistic missile &#x2014; Oreshnik (Hazel). Russian forces launched a missile attack on the city earlier in the day, reportedly using a new type of ballistic missile. Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the type of missile used in the strike. Putin claimed Ukraine targeted facilities in Russia&apos;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. In response, Russian forces launched a combined attack on a defense industry facility in Dnipro, according to the Russian president. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance.Putin warned that Russia would use weapons against any country whose arms are used to strike Russian targets.Putin claimed that the U.S. was allegedly planning to produce and deploy medium- and shorter-range missiles in Ukraine. The Russian president also promised that he would warn Ukrainian civilians and citizens of other countries in advance to leave the area of possible weapons impact.President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier that Putin is using Ukraine as &quot;a testing ground&quot; by launching missiles at Ukrainian cities.The recent attack against damaged an industrial enterprise, two houses, and nine garages and caused two fires, said Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was also damaged, Mayor Borys Filatov said.Two people were injured in the strike. Russian authorities reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the border regions of Rostov and Voronezh on Nov. 21, claiming that an industrial facility had been hit. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that its forces intercepted two drones over the two regions, making no mention of possible damage or whether some of the drones slipped through the defenses. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said on his Telegram channel that a fire broke out at an industrial facility in the central Konstantinovsky district because of a &quot;drone crash.&quot; Slyusar claimed that firefighters quickly extinguished the fire. The type of the facility and the full extent of damage were not specified. Another drone was reportedly downed in Rostov Oblast&apos;s Myasnikovsky district, inflicting no damage. No casualties were reported. The airport in the city of Volgograd, lying northeast of Rostov Oblast, temporarily suspended operations due to safety concerns, the Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all of the claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Two industrial facilities &#x2013; including a factory producing cargo drones for the Russian military &#x2013; and a military arsenal were allegedly hit during drone attacks overnight on Nov. 20. Hungary is deploying air defense systems near the Ukrainian border, citing increased risks after the West allowed the use of long-range weapons inside Russian territory, Defense Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky said on Nov. 20. The minister ordered the deployment of air defense systems in the country&apos;s northeastern regions, saying that &quot;the war has entered its most dangerous phase.&quot; Szalay-Bobrovniczky attributed this escalation namely to the easing of restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with Western arms and linked it to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s approval of an updated nuclear doctrine. This decision comes after two Russian missiles were shot down on Nov. 17 in Zakarpattia Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region bordering Hungary and home to an estimated 75,000 ethnic Hungarians. On that occasion, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that it was necessary to &quot;strengthen efforts to bring peace&quot; as &quot;each day brings with it the risk of escalating war.&quot; Budapest has consistently criticized and obstructed Western military support for Ukraine, claiming it would lead to an escalation, and has maintained warm ties with Moscow throughout the full-scale war. Previously, Russian drones and missiles launched during strikes on Ukraine have crossed into the airspace of other countries, namely Poland, Latvia, Romania, Moldova, and Belarus. The latest development in Hungary follows a series of increasingly strong resolutions by Ukraine&apos;s Western allies. After U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged that the Biden administration would bolster support for Kyiv before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, President Joe Biden on Nov. 17 allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS missiles to strike a Russian military arsenal in Bryansk Oblast on Nov. 19 and allegedly also used U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow on Nov. 20, marking the first instance of these weapons being used on Russian soil. Other Western allies have expressed their position on their own supplied weapons. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Nov. 18 that Paris &quot;remained open&quot; to allowing Ukraine to use French long-range missiles to strike military targets inside Russia, reported Le Monde. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that she &quot;understands&quot; the U.S. response to Russia, but Rome makes a &quot;different choice&quot; and focuses on air defenses for Ukraine. Russian forces are suspected of summarily executing a group of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported on Nov. 20. Lubinets said that the prisoners were &quot;surrounded&quot; but gave no other details, in particular on the number of victims. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian POWs are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. &quot;I have sent letters to the U.N. and the ICRC about this crime,&quot; Lubinets said, reporting the suspected crime on his Telegram channel. &quot;The international community must act immediately. The occupying country has once again violated the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war,&quot; he added. The Armyinform news outlet ties this announcement to a video taken by a drone camera purporting to show the execution. It shows 10 unarmed people lying on the ground with at least five armed men standing over them. &#xA0;At one point, they start shooting at the people on the ground. Heavy fighting has been ongoing in the Russian border region of Kursk since Ukraine launched an offensive there in early August. Earlier the same day, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced another shooting of captured Ukrainian military personnel by Russian troops in the Pokrovsk area in Ukraine. Former Prosecutor General Kostin on Oct. 15 called the killing of captured Ukrainian service members in captivity a &quot;deliberate policy of the Russian Federation.&quot; The execution of prisoners of war constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Convention. Russian forces had executed at least 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022 as of Nov. 6, authorities said at the time, while the number continues to grow. On top of that, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity, according to a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is on the verge of a blackout after Russian attacks on power lines left the plant connected to only one line, the Energy Ministry reported on Nov. 21. This is the second time this week that the plant has been seriously threatened by a blackout, which could compromise conditions for safe operation and cause an accident. At the moment, the plant is connected to the Ukrainian power grid by only one transmission line. Similar incidents have been reported throughout the full-scale war, with Kyiv accusing Russia of threatening the security of the plant. Russia has occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear station in Europe, since March 2022. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko confirmed that if the last line is cut off, there will be a complete blackout, as reported by the Energy Ministry&apos;s Telegram channel. The Zaporizhzhia plant is not the only one causing concern. The Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and Southern Ukrainian plants were forced to decrease output on Nov. 17 after a massive Russian aerial strike targeted several substations critical to their power supply. Greenpeace warned that Ukraine&apos;s power grid was at &quot;heightened risk of catastrophic failure&quot; after the mass missile and drone attack targeted the electrical substations. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, confirmed in a statement on Nov. 17 that Ukraine&apos;s nuclear power plants had to reduce their electricity production as a precautionary measure due to large-scale missile attacks. The attacks on Ukraine&apos;s infrastructure led to &quot;increased nuclear safety and security risks,&quot; Grossi agreed. Allowing Ukraine to regain control &quot;is the only way to ensure the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,&quot; Halushchenko said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-launches-new-oreshnik-intermediate-range-ballistic-missile-against-ukraine/	2024-11-21T12:12:37-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-21_10-53-05.jpg
UK prepared to fight Russia if it invades Eastern European NATO member, British general says	The U.K. is prepared to send its soldiers to fight Russia if it invades a NATO country on the alliance&apos;s eastern flank, Rob Magowan, the deputy chief of the British defense staff, said on Nov. 21, Politico reported. Concerns over rising Russian aggression are growing in Europe, fueled by Moscow&apos;s advances in eastern Ukraine. Uncertainty about Europe&#x2019;s readiness to defend itself has been compounded by Republican Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly stated that the U.S. might not support allies that fail to meet NATO defense spending commitments. When asked how many British brigades could be deployed to NATO&apos;s eastern flank in the event of significant Russian escalation, Magowan assured lawmakers that the U.K. would respond immediately if called upon. &quot;I don&apos;t think anybody in this room should be under any illusion that if the Russians invaded Eastern Europe tonight, then we would meet them in that fight,&quot; Magowan told the House of Commons defense committee. Magowan noted that the British Armed Forces possess &quot;a range of operational risks and operational strengths.&quot; His comments follow the U.K. Defense Ministry&apos;s announcement on Nov. 21 that the British Army had completed live-fire testing of its Archer mobile howitzer, a rapidly deployable artillery system. The tests were conducted during a 12-day NATO exercise in Finland. Despite this, the British government has expressed concern over the state of its military, with the British Army now at its smallest size since the 1700s, Politico reported. In an interview last month, U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said the condition of the armed forces was &quot;far worse than we thought&quot; when his Labor Party took office this summer. The government is currently conducting a Strategic Defense Review, according to the outlet.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-prepared-to-fight-russia-if-it-invades-eastern-european-nato-member-british-general-says/	2024-11-21T11:33:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/GettyImages-1253226504.jpg
Investigation: Who helped Russians increase production of domestic attack drones despite sanctions	An American-made HIMARS artillery system races down a Ukrainian road as a kamikaze drone hunts it down. The drone flies into the vehicle, followed by an explosion. The scene was caught on video by a Russian reconnaissance drone in mid-November. The drone that hit the HIMARS was a Lancet &#x2014; one of Russia&#x2019;s most used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Russia has used thousands of them against Ukraine. The weapons are produced by Zala Aero Group, a privately-owned group of Russian companies, with the state holding a minority stake in one of its entities. It is one of the largest manufacturers of Russian combat drones attacking Ukraine. Like other Russian defense producers, the group has been targeted by Western sanctions and export restrictions that seek to undercut the Russian war effort by prohibiting the sale of defense-related parts and tech to Russia. In theory, the sanctions are supposed to be effective against the production of drones, which are highly dependent on imported parts. In reality, the use of Zala Aero&#x2019;s drones in the Russian war against Ukraine has been growing. Over the past year, it tripled. An investigation by the Kyiv Independent has found that Zala Aero has managed to continue to grow, despite sanctions, by feeding its production through a reliable system of Chinese suppliers. The investigation started when the Kyiv Independent obtained emails of Zala Aero Group employees that were hacked by Ukrainian intelligence. The emails illustrate how much Zala Aero&apos;s drone production depends on imported components. The Kyiv Independent tracked down Russian tax data on the suppliers of the Zala Aero Group and Russian customs records on the imported goods it was purchasing. This revealed the ecosystem of suppliers &#x2014; foreign and domestic &#x2014; that feed Zala Aero&#x2019;s drone production. Having read through thousands of lines of Zala Group business transactions and hundreds of work papers, the Kyiv Independent can now show how China came to the aid of this part of the Russian military machine, likely supplying it with more than just Chinese components. We also looked into what can be done to close the loopholes and stop Russia&apos;s deadly drone production, which is still dependent on imports. The most well-known military products of the Russian Zala Group are the Lancet attack drones and Zala reconnaissance UAVs. The Lancet kamikaze drones attack Ukrainian infantry and military vehicles, while the reconnaissance drones work alongside them, serving as the eyes of the Russian army to help identify targets. L: Russian Lancet attack drone. R: Zala reconnaissance drone. (Zala Aero)Lancet kamikaze drones can&#x2019;t fly as far as Iranian Shaheds and their Russian-made versions, the Geran, which attack Ukrainian cities far from the battlefield every night. Instead, Lancet drones are used on the battlefield, targeting the Ukrainian military along the entire front line. Lancets can carry 3-5 kilograms of explosives and fly 20-40 miles &#x2014; enough to damage, and sometimes destroy, large military vehicles, including tanks, artillery systems, and planes on the ground. Russia first used them in Syria. Since mid-2022, Lancets have been a mainstay of the Russian drone arsenal in Ukraine. Zala doesn&#x2019;t just supply the Russian war &#x2014; it appears to fully align itself with it. Zala Aero Group publicly brags about fresh Lancet attacks on equipment provided to Ukraine by its partners. The group claims Lancets have hit German Leopard and American Abrams tanks, American Paladin, British M777, and French Caesar howitzers, as well as Ukrainian-made vehicles. &#x201C;Targets are being hit round-the-clock,&#x201D; one of the company&#x2019;s social media posts boasted of the use of Lancets in October 2024. &#x201C;The work is carried out along the entire front line and in the rear.&#x201D; Among the hacked emails obtained by the Kyiv Independent, there is a letter by a Russian army commander, dated April 2023. In the letter, he addresses the CEO of Zala Aero, commending the company&#x2019;s instructors who help in training the Russian military to operate their drones. &#x201C;I look forward to further cooperation,&#x201D; the letter concludes, &#x201C;and increasing the production and supply of unmanned aerial vehicles and loitering munitions.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s exactly what happened next &#x2014; Zala began producing more drones. Russia has used around 7,000 Lancet drones against Ukraine as of early November 2024, the Ukrainian Air Force told the Kyiv Independent. &#x201C;There is a steady increase in the use of these munitions,&#x201D; they added. A Russian site monitoring military equipment losses, Lostarmour, lists over 2,500 Lancet drone attacks against Ukraine, confirmed by video evidence. Even this limited data is enough to spot a clear trend: The confirmed use of Lancet drones in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine in the first 10 months of 2024 increased almost threefold compared to the same period in 2023: 1,654 cases versus 629, according to Lostarmour. &#x201C;Up to eight Lancets can fly over us per day, and they always work in tandem with Zala drones that guide attack drones,&#x201D; a Ukrainian soldier currently participating in the operation in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Region told the Kyiv Independent. The soldier is not publicly identified due to security restrictions. Besides the effect on the battlefield, there is another indicator that Zala is growing its output: The group has been investing in production. Since mid-2022, they started building new production facilities and buying equipment, according to Agiya Zagrebelska, a Ukrainian expert on sanctions policy who has been closely watching Zala. The internal documents obtained by the Kyiv Independent also show that, after the start of the full-scale war, the company has bought new equipment. In September 2022, one of the Zala Aero Group&apos;s key companies, Aeroscan, ordered seven milling machines for a total of nearly $800,000. These machines are used in drone production that were manufactured by the Chinese company YangSen. There wouldn&#x2019;t be anything odd about a military manufacturer growing in the time of war &#x2014; except that this manufacturer can&#x2019;t work without imported parts, which international sanctions have cut off &#x2014; in theory. Like all kamikaze drones, Lancets self-destruct when they attack, making it difficult to analyze their hardware. One thing is certain: A lot of their parts aren&#x2019;t of Russian origin. The internal correspondence contains an audio recording of a meeting between representatives of the Russian government and drone manufacturers that offers a glimpse into just how concerned they were with the industry&#x2019;s dependence on imports. The meeting most likely took place in Moscow in February 2023. At one point, Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s special representative for technological development, and a namesake of the Russian president&#x2019;s notorious spokesman, appears to pop up into the room &#x2014; the meeting&#x2019;s chairman notes his brief appearance, but Peskov isn&#x2019;t heard talking. The meeting focused on the upcoming Unmanned Aircraft Systems project &#x2014; a Russian state program that aims to support and grow the Russian drone industry from 2024 to 2030. The project has since been approved and launched. Almost every person speaking at the meeting raised the problem of drone manufacturers&apos; dependence on imported electronic components and engines. &#x201C;I&apos;m very much concerned about components, I&apos;m very much concerned about onboard electronic equipment,&#x201D; the meeting&#x2019;s chairman, whom we identified as Vasilii Shpak, deputy industry and trade minister of Russia, said at the beginning of the meeting, setting the tone. During the conversation, Shpak noted he had a wealth of experience in delivering components from anywhere in the world to meet the needs of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine. &#x201C;The more serious difficulties we face are the lack of domestic motors for our heavy machines that we want to launch&#x2026; and the fact that some of the components we want to replace are not always available in Russia,&#x201D; said Nickolay Burdin, commercial director of the Russian private company Aeromax. &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t do without imports for now,&#x201D; the chairman summarized. Another document the Kyiv Independent found in the correspondence also illustrates Zala Group&apos;s dependence on imports. The document is a 2019 Microsoft Word file titled &#x201C;List of electronic components.&#x201D; It apparently refers to the electronic components that Zala Aero Group was using or was going to use in the production of its drones back then. The document lists 24 components manufactured by Keysight Technologies, a U.S. company. Five years later, the Lancet drones still use foreign parts of mixed origin. Ukraine&#x2019;s military intelligence agency, known in Ukraine as HUR, maintains a public register of foreign components discovered in captured Russian weapons and military equipment. It includes a list of components found in three Lancet models that were downed in Ukraine. Among them, there are no components from Keysight Technologies. But there are products from many others. The Lancets had components from a number of American companies: Nvidia, National Semiconductor, Microchip Technology, Micron Technology, Xilinx, Texas Instruments, Atmel Corporation, Analog Devices, Qorvo, Maxim Integrated Products, Bel Fuse, and Semtech Corporation. There were also components from other countries: Swiss companies STMicroelectronics, U-blox, and TE Connectivity; the German company Infineon Technologies; Dutch companies NXP Semiconductors and Skoopia; and South Korea&#x2019;s Ricci Microwave and SK Hynix, and others. Some of the components remained unidentified, their origin unknown. Among the imported components required by Zala Aero, one will find chips, microprocessors, cameras, video encoders and decoders, microcontrollers, transceivers, resistors, transistors, and batteries. A screenshot from the website, run by Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence, that lists some of the components found in a Russian Lancet drone in Ukraine. (War-sanctions.gur.gov.ua)So the question is: How did Zala Aero Group, so dependent on imported components, manage to increase drone production despite the sanctions and export restrictions that were meant to stop the flow of microelectronics and machine tools into Russia? Following the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, a number of countries imposed export controls, prohibiting the sale of microelectronics, motors, and machine tools to Russia. Instead of getting the necessary supplies from America or Europe, Russian producers now buy them from third countries. Russia&#x2019;s biggest helper here is China. This country makes up for Russia&apos;s deficit both with its own production and as a distributor of foreign manufacturers. China has become the lifeline of the Zala Aero Group. We have studied the import data of several Zala Aero Group companies in 2022-2024, received with the help of OCCRP, an international investigative journalism group. We identified the two companies that imported foreign parts for Zala Aero&#x2019;s drone production &#x2014; OMP and Spetstechnotrade. The two companies have different owners than the rest of the group. One was founded by a Zala Aero employee and another &#x2014; by an employee&#x2019;s father. The ownership structure appears to be an attempt to safeguard the companies from a direct association with military production, which could have complicated foreign trade for them. These two companies are suppliers to Zala Aero&#x2019;s two main drone manufacturers &#x2014; Aeroscan and CST, according to Russian Tax Service data. The import records indicate they have purchased goods from a number of Chinese and Hong Kong suppliers: Jiangxi Xintuo Enterprise, Bestop Globle MFG, Star Rapid Manufacturing, Microblock technology, Gpcomm technology, and M-Function investment management. Chinese and Hong Kong partners supplied Zala Aero&#x2019;s companies with motors, electrical conductors, carbon fiber products, aluminum alloy frames, and aluminum products worth millions of dollars. These components are used in drone production. Some of these Chinese and Hong Kong entities are listed in customs databases not only as sellers but also as manufacturers of the sold products, including motors. The Kyiv Independent sent out inquiries to several Chinese and Hong Kong companies selling components to Zala Aero Group, asking about the products they sell ending up in Russian drone production during the war. Other companies from the list of suppliers have no public representation or contact details. One of the suppliers, Star Rapid Manufacturing, responded. According to their reply, the Russian company OMP misinformed the company, claiming its business activities were not related to military production. &#x201C;At the time of our dealings, OMP presented itself as an independent entity, and OMP confirmed that the parts were not related to military equipment,&#x201D; wrote the company. &#x201C;Upon becoming aware of OMP&#x2019;s association with Zala Aero Group, which we were previously not aware of, and their inclusion in sanctions, we promptly ended our business relationship with OMP.&#x201D; Sanctions against the Zakharov family and Zala Aero Group companies. (The Kyiv Independent)But the two affiliated companies, OMP and Spetstechnotrade, don&#x2019;t cover all of Zala Aero&#x2019;s needs for imported components. Zala Aero also uses other, unaffiliated external Russian suppliers. These Russian intermediaries import and resell components, both Western and Asian-made. One of them is a Moscow-based supplier named Online Trade. In 2024, this company repeatedly sold goods to several entities of Zala Aero Group: CST, Aeroscan, and Spetstechnotrade. Evidence of these deals is found in the leaked data of the Russian Tax Office. The data doesn&#x2019;t specify which items Online Trade supplies to Zala Aero, but the import database shows that Online Trade has been bringing large volumes of video cameras and lenses, as well as microelectronics, to Russia. The Russian company bought the cameras from a number of companies, including the Hong Kong-based companies Angco International Trading and Union Camera Hong Kong. They are distributors, not producers: They resell cameras, including Western-made ones. Its chains like that &#x2014; a Hong Kong reseller, a Russian broker, and finally a Russian drone manufacturer &#x2014; that put a Western-made camera inside a drone that hunts down Western-donated equipment on the battlefield in Ukraine. Online Trade is not the only Russian intermediary reselling imported components to Zala Aero Group. Other Russian companies also supplied it with items in 2024: Chip and Dip, Hartis DV, Raidecs, San Susi, Fotopark, and others. Among the Hartis DV suppliers was a Hong Kong company Izzition E-Technology which calls itself a distributor of Western brands like NXP, Altera, and Xilinx. The NXP and Xilinx products were found in Russian Lancets downed in Ukraine. For details about the import procurement of Zala Aero&#x2019;s Russian suppliers, see the following chart: Supply chains of some of the imported components for Zala Aero. (The Kyiv Independent)Sanctions against the suppliers of Zala Aero Group and its intermediaries. (The Kyiv Independent)The China problemChina has become a convenient back door for Russian companies in need of the goods that fall under export restrictions, imposed by a number of countries to deprive Russian military production of key components. Before selling sensitive goods to China, companies from those countries have to check that they will not be heading to Russia. In reality, often, only the &#x201C;first-tier&#x201D; buyer ends up checked, and not the end consumer to whom goods will be resold. In an effort to publicly distance itself from Russia&#x2019;s, China promised to tighten restrictions on the supply of drones and components to Russia. But experts are somewhat skeptical about the actual impact of these statements, given previous experience. &#x201C;China has proven itself unwilling to strictly enforce export restrictions on electronic goods, especially those produced by Western firms, from going to Russia,&#x201D; Spencer Faragasso, a senior research fellow with the Institute for Science and International Security (U.S.), told the Kyiv Independent. China has positioned itself as neutral in the ongoing war but has been supplying Russia with materials that directly boost its war machine, receiving military technology support from Russia in return, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said recently. &#x201C;The sanctions coalition countries have three options for responding to China&apos;s role in supporting Russia&apos;s military machine,&#x201D; says Agiya Zagrebelska, the Ukrainian sanctions expert. &#x201D;The first is to escalate economic restrictions with China. But let&apos;s be honest, no one is ready to take this step, because China is too big a market. The second option is to leave everything as it is. And the third is what we are proposing: the implementation of real penalties against component and machine tool manufacturers (in the form of) investigations and fines.&#x201D; Zagrebelska says that manufacturers pay attention only to the first buyer in the chain because no one punishes them for turning a blind eye to where the goods end up. &#x201C;We call it willful blindness. We are convinced that with all the modern capabilities of big data and artificial intelligence, a manufacturer is able to identify risky buyers by their typical characteristics,&#x201D; says Zagrebelska. A similar idea of fines for Western producers combined with government support to move their plants outside of China has also been proposed by the American Institute for Science and International Security. &#x201C;The unfortunate reality is that Western electronics companies, particularly those based in the U.S., have not done enough. They can legitimately be accused of helping to arm Russia in its bloody attacks on Ukraine,&#x201D; the Institute writes in a recent report. &#x201C;Western countries are supplying Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment to defend Ukraine from Russian weapons that could not function without Western electronic goods. Halting the flow of these items can have a meaningful impact on Russia&#x2019;s ability to field its weapons against Ukraine.&#x201D; The owners of Zala Aero Group, Aleksandr Zakharov and his family, are among the main beneficiaries of the Russian war&#x2019;s insatiable hunger for drones. In the first quarter of 2024 alone, Aeroscan, a company part of the Zala Aero Group, earned nearly $90 million by supplying the Russian Defense Ministry, military units, and the logistics center of Russia&#x2019;s National Guard with products, according to Russian Tax Service leaked data. The leaked emails of Zala Aero&apos;s employees allow us to map out the roles that members of the Zakharov family play in the business. The elder Zakharov is the main owner and chief designer of Zala Aero. His son Nikita Zakharov is the founder of several Zala Aero Group companies, mostly involved in software development. Recently, the Russian tax authorities closed public access to the data on the founders and managers of the companies created by Nikita Zakharov in the Russian company register. This is done for companies that perform state defense contracts or are under international sanctions. Zala Aero founder Aleksandr Zakharov with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an undated photograph.

(Russian Research and Development Institute of Robotics and Control System)Aleksandr Zakharov&apos;s wife Svetlana (L), daughter Maria (R). (Social media)The father and the son appear to be the brains behind Zala Aero Group. In the email leak available to us, there is a document called &#x201C;Structure.&#x201D; It contains a list of employees of the entire group as of February 2021. Some of the employees are marked as supervised by Aleksandr Zakharov, others are supervised by his son Nikita. It marks employees as subordinated to AV, which it explains stands for Aleksandr Vladislavovich Zakharov, or NZ, for Nikita Zakharov. Zakharov&apos;s wife Svetlana is in charge of the administrative side of the business, including renting production facilities. Their daughter Maria is the founder of several software development and research companies that until recently were part of the group, but that are now being dissolved. Until recently, Zakharov&apos;s younger son Lavrentii was not publicly listed among the founders of any Russian companies. He resided in Europe and attended a London university, occasionally visiting Russia. However, our documents show that he was involved in his Russian family&#x2019;s business even while studying in London. The leaked correspondence contains his reports on the flaws in the TiEn unmanned flight simulator, another development of the Zala Aero Group, which he apparently tested. The reports date back to July 2019, when Lavrentii Zakharov was 20 years old. At the time, he was studying at University College London and was a member of the UCL Eurasian Business Society, an organization that unites the Russian-speaking community in London. At the same time, he managed to test a drone simulator developed by his family&#x2019;s company. Lavrentii Zakharov seen in a group photo posted by the Instagram account of the UCL Eurasian Business Society on Nov. 22, 2018. (UCLEBS/Instagram)Lavrentii&#x2019;s European life was marred in the summer of 2023, when independent Russian investigative outlet iStories revealed that the son of the Russian drone tycoon had interned at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Affairs in Geneva. The story also found that the Zakharov family owned an apartment in central London worth 1.5 million pounds. The investigation also revealed that none of the family members were under personal international sanctions at the time, despite their business&#x2019;s role in Russia&#x2019;s war effort. After the story ran, the Zakharovs were sanctioned by the U.K. and the U.S., which means that their assets in these countries should be frozen. The UN Institute has removed the page that mentioned Lavrentii Zakharov&apos;s internship. He has the internship marked as completed in September 2023 on his LinkedIn page. Lavrentii Zakharov seen in group photos taken at the United Nations offices in Geneva in June 2023. (ibei.org)London building where the Zakharov family bought their apartment in 2018. (Google Maps)Alleged view of the apartment apartment at 47 Marsham Street, London, UK.&#xA0;The EU and other Western and non-Western countries haven&#x2019;t imposed personal sanctions on the Zakharovs yet. Our investigation shows that after the scandal, the youngest Zakharov apparently returned to Russia. In December 2023, Lavrentii Zakharov founded his own company in Moscow called Zakharov and Grek Technical Bureau, a technology consulting firm. And in 2024, we spotted him in a photo with Russian model Natalia Kozyreva, taken in Moscow, apparently on her birthday. Lavrentii Zakharov with Russian model Natalia Kozyreva in Moscow in 2024. A Google Street View screenshot from the same location confirms the photo was taken in Moscow. (Instagram, Google Maps)The sanctions seem to have brought the entire Zakharov family to Russia. This is where their effect has been exhausted, for now. But this does not mean that the channels that feed the Russian military machine can&#x2019;t be cut off. Western suppliers could stop selling critical components to Chinese intermediaries that resell them to Russia. Chinese companies could also adhere to their government&apos;s stated policy of not selling drones and components to the aggressor. Together, these steps would deprive Russia of some of the key weapons it uses to wage its war in Ukraine. Hey! This is Alisa Yurchenko, I wrote this story. Thank you for reading this far, it was a long one to get through. It&#x2019;s upsetting that the Russian manufacturer at the center of the story can still produce weapons that attack Ukraine, even though Russia doesn&#x2019;t make critical components for them domestically. But I&apos;m glad that I was able to demonstrate how the manufacturer imports the components from abroad. I hope this will draw attention to the problem, which is actually much broader than a single drone manufacturer. This by no means signals that sanctions are useless. On the opposite: The story shows how dependent Russian manufacturers are on imported components, and how vulnerable they really are to trade limitations. It means that if sanctions and exports controls are improved, and enforced, they have real potential of severely undermining Russia&#x2019;s war effort.

US imposes sanctions on over 50 Russian banks, including Gazprombank	The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian banks, including Gazprombank, securities registrars, and financial officials, according to a Nov. 21 statement. The U.K. and Canada sanctioned Gazprombank during the first weeks of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022. The U.S., however, had previously avoided strict measures against the bank. &quot;Today&apos;s sanctions targeting Russia&apos;s largest remaining non-designated bank, as well as dozens of other financial institutions and officials in Russia, will further diminish and degrade Russia&apos;s war machine,&quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. The U.S. had refrained from targeting Gazprombank to allow European countries to continue paying for Russian gas supplies, as the bank is the primary channel for energy-related payments, Financial Times reported. &quot;This sweeping action will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.&quot; The outlet also noted that Russia used Gazprombank to purchase military equipment, pay soldiers, and compensate the families of those killed in the war in Ukraine. The new U.S. sanctions will close one of Russia&apos;s few remaining avenues for international banking, barring Gazprombank from conducting transactions in dollars. In addition to Gazprombank, the U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned over 50 Russian banks connected to the international financial system, more than 40 securities registrars, and 15 financial officials. OFAC also issued an alert detailing the sanctions risks associated with Russia&#x2019;s financial messaging system, which the Kremlin is using to evade existing restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-imposes-sanctions-on-over-50-russian-banks-including-gazprombank/	2024-11-21T10:50:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1258690185.jpg

Russia used intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine, Putin says	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated Russia tested its new intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, in a strike on Dnipro on Nov. 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. Russian forces launched a missile attack on the city earlier in the day, reportedly using a conventional intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the type of missile used in the strike. Putin claimed Ukraine targeted facilities in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk and Bryansk oblasts with long-range ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles on Nov. 19 and 20. In response, Russian forces launched a combined attack on a defense industry facility in Dnipro, according to the Russian president. The Oreshnik missile is designed to carry nuclear weapons. However, Putin said it was not armed with a nuclear warhead in this instance.Putin also warned that Russia would use weapons against any country whose arms are used to strike Russian targets.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-used-intermediate-range-ballistic-missile-against-ukraine-putin-says/	2024-11-21T10:00:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1246327671.jpg
Russian FM spokesperson asked not to comment on ballistic missile strike on Ukraine during briefing	Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova received a call during her Nov. 21 press briefing instructing her not to comment on the latest ballistic missile attacks on Ukraine. Zakharova gave the briefing following a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro earlier that day, allegedly involving an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). If confirmed, it would mark the first use of an ICBM in war, a weapon primarily designed for long-range nuclear strikes. During the briefing, Zakharova stood near the microphone, allowing a man&apos;s voice on the phone to be heard saying: &quot;Masha, our strikes with ballistic missiles, which we did not talk about , are not commented on at all.&quot; Zakharova replied, &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; Zakharova stood near the microphone, so an unnamed man on the phone could be heard telling her: &quot;Masha, our ballistic missile strikes, which we didn&apos;t talk about, we don&apos;t comment on at all.&quot; Zakharova replied: &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; A recording of the exchange has circulated online and through various media outlets. Zakharova later told Russia&apos;s state-owned TASS news agency that the call was to &quot;clarify whether the Foreign Ministry could comment on the topic.&quot; She added, &quot;The answer was received during the briefing &#x2014; the Foreign Ministry does not comment. So, there is no intrigue.&quot; Russia allegedly used the Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, during the Nov. 21 attack, Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. President Volodymyr Zelensky said an investigation is ongoing but noted that the missile&apos;s &quot;speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-fm-spokesperson-asked-not-to-comment-on-ballistic-missile-strike-on-ukraine-during-briefing/	2024-11-21T08:57:36-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1237721878.jpg

Ukraine first country to face intercontinental ballistic missile use, Ukraine's Stratcom agency claims	Ukraine is the first country in the world against which an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has been used, Ukraine&apos;s Center for Strategic Communications (Stratcom) said on Nov. 21. &quot;We will do everything to ensure that Russia is remembered in history only for its crimes,&quot; Stratcom said in a statement. Russian forces launched a missile attack on the city of Dnipro earlier in the day, allegedly using a conventional ICBM. The attack injured two people. If Russia did use an ICBM against Ukraine, it would be the first use in war of a weapon designed to deliver long-range nuclear strikes. The missile was launched from Astrakhan Oblast, a Russian region 740 kilometers (460 miles) from Dnipro, according to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force. The attack damaged an industrial enterprise, two houses, and nine garages and caused two fires, said Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was also damaged, Mayor Borys Filatov said. Russia allegedly used the Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, which is capable of carrying nuclear warheads, Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne reported, citing unidentified law enforcement sources. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the report. President Volodymyr Zelensky said an investigation is ongoing but noted that the missile&apos;s &quot;speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s clear that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is using Ukraine as a testing ground. It&apos;s also clear that he is terrified of normal life next to him. A life where people live with dignity,&quot; Zelensky said on the occasion of Ukraine&apos;s Day of Dignity and Freedom, commemorating the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2013-14.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-first-country-to-face-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-use-ukraines-stratcom-agency-claims/	2024-11-21T07:11:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-21_10-53-05--2-.jpg
Nikki Haley slams Trump's top intelligence pick Gabbard, calls her 'Russian sympathizer'	U.S. Republican politician Nikki Haley on Nov. 20 criticized Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump&apos;s nominee for the director of national intelligence, for her foreign policy stances, including her favorable positions towards Russia and other authoritarian regimes. Gabbard&#x2019;s nomination comes as part of Trump&#x2019;s proposed cabinet, a choice that has sparked concern in Kyiv due to the former Hawaii congresswoman&apos;s Ukraine-skeptic views. Speaking on her podcast Nikki Haley Live, the ex-South South Carolina governor slammed Gabbard&#x2019;s past statements and actions, particularly her criticism of NATO and her remarks about Russia&#x2019;s &quot;legitimate security concerns&quot; regarding Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership. &quot;After Russia invaded Ukraine, Tulsi Gabbard literally blamed NATO, our Western alliance that&#x2019;s responsible for countering Russia,&quot; said Haley, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination before conceding to Trump. &quot;She blamed NATO for the attack on Ukraine, and the Russians and the Chinese echoed her talking points and her interviews on Russian and Chinese television.&quot; When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Gabbard posted the video of her Fox News comments about U.S. sanctions against Russia on Twitter (now X) and suggested that &quot;doing anything to press Putin to stop the invasion of Ukraine could lead to a nuclear war.&quot; Gabbard also argued that the eastward expansion of NATO had provoked Moscow and claimed that the U.S. was fueling a proxy war with Russia that could lead to a &quot;forever war.&quot; A former congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq War veteran, Gabbard has faced longstanding scrutiny for her foreign policy views. Haley also criticized Gabbard&#x2019;s broader foreign policy record, highlighting her 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which she called disgusting.&quot; She also questioned Gabbard&#x2019;s ability to handle national security responsibilities, accusing her of being &quot;overly sympathetic&quot; to authoritarian regimes. &quot;This is not a place for a Russian, Iranian, Syrian, or Chinese sympathizer,&quot; Haley said. She also added that Gabbard has consistently failed to denounce her controversial positions. Neither Gabbard nor her team has responded to Haley&#x2019;s comments.	https://kyivindependent.com/haley-gabbard/	2024-11-21T06:22:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182701925.jpg
Russian ICBM strike would be 'clear escalation,' EU says	Russia using an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) against Ukraine would be a &quot;clear escalation&quot; by Moscow, EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano told reporters on Nov. 21 after Kyiv said Russian forces deployed the weapon. &quot;While we&apos;re assessing the full facts, it&apos;s obvious that such (an) attack would mark yet another clear escalation from the side of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Stano said, according to AFP. The Ukrainian Air Force said that Russia launched nine missiles, including a conventional ICBM, against the central-eastern city of Dnipro on the morning of Nov. 21, injuring at least two people and damaging several buildings. President Volodymyr Zelensky later clarified that the investigation is ongoing but that the missile&apos;s &quot;speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities.&quot; If confirmed, it would mark the first occasion of Russia deploying an ICBM in the war against Ukraine, coming shortly after the U.S. permitted Ukraine to carry out strikes in Russia with Western long-range missiles and after Russia updated its nuclear deterrence policy. While an undisclosed Ukrainian official told ABC News that Ukraine was &quot;95%&quot; certain Russia deployed an ICBM, a Western official quoted by the news outlet disputed the claim, saying it resembled a regular ballistic missile. It remains unclear what type of ICBM was reportedly deployed. The missile was launched from Astrakhan Oblast in southern Russia, over 700 kilometers (435 miles) east of Dnipro. Russia has not immediately commented. In a video clip widely shared in the media, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova received a phone call during a press conference apparently asking her not to comment on reports about &quot;ballistic missile strikes.&quot; Zakharova later claimed she was merely asking &quot;experts whether this was our topic,&quot; and the &quot;answer came during the briefing: the Foreign Ministry does not comment. There is no conspiracy.&quot; If the use of such a weapon is confirmed, it would mark &quot;quantitative and qualitative change&quot; in the war, according to Stano. According to the spokesperson, Russia is &quot;playing a nuclear gamble. Whether they really mean it, it&apos;s very hard to foresee.&quot; &quot;We only know that this is irresponsible and this constitutes a global threat,&quot; he added.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-russia-icbm/	2024-11-21T05:44:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1205267788.jpeg
Ukraine '95% ready' to resume flights but needs adequate air defenses, minister says	Ukraine is &quot;95%&quot; ready to resume commercial flights, but the key remaining factor is to ensure the safety of passengers, Communities and Territories Development Minister Oleksii Kuleba said on Nov. 21. Speaking with the &#xA0;Suspilne broadcaster, the minister said: &quot;The security architecture requires very serious air defenses... so when we have enough air defense for this or that airport, we will be able to talk about it. Unfortunately, today it is impractical.&quot; Ukraine closed its sky for civilian aviation at the start of martial law and the full-scale invasion in 2022, but some recent statements suggest the country could restart commercial flights as early as next year. When asked if it is possible to hope for the opening of air traffic in 2025, Kuleba said that it will depend on the situation on the front. &quot;Of course, we can hope. But if we are realistic, then in principle, we can only talk about it with respect to the front-line situation. As with all other issues concerning the development of our country: first the front, then anything else,&quot; Kuleba said. Crispin Ellison, a senior partner at the Marsh McLennan insurance and risk management firm, said on Nov. 7 that at least one of Ukraine&apos;s airports, either in Lviv or Boryspil near Kyiv, could resume operations by the end of January 2025. &quot;Opening Lviv is the beginning of a journey to opening up Boryspil,&quot; Ellison told a Kyiv Independent reporter at the Kyiv International Economic Forum. &quot;What we need is a confirmation around the (air) defenses and the military situation, which allows regulatory sign-off,&quot; Ellison added. Under favorable circumstances, according to Ellison, five or six airlines could agree to operate flights from Ukraine in January. Lviv lies in the western part of the country. While it has suffered a number of deadly attacks during the full-scale war, it has been targeted considerably less often than other major cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv, or Odesa. Ukrinform reported that insurance companies are ready for political decisions on the resumption of air traffic with Ukraine. At the end of October, Ukraine presented a roadmap for the partial reopening of its airspace under martial law, outlining a step-by-step plan and requirements. International airlines, including LOT Polish Airlines, SkyUp Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air, and others, also joined the discussion on opening airspace in Ukraine during martial law.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-flights/	2024-11-21T05:03:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-973341882.jpg
Putin is using Ukraine as training ground,' Zelensky says after reported ICBM strike	Russia&apos;s apparent deployment of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) against Dnipro on Nov. 21 shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;is using Ukraine as his training ground,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. &quot;Today (on Nov. 21), there was a new Russian missile. All its features &#x2013; speed, altitude &#x2013; show it was an intercontinental ballistic missile. An analysis is underway,&quot; Zelensky said in a video address on his Telegram channel. Russian forces launched the conventional ICBM, along with seven cruise missiles and a Kinzhal ballistic missile, against the central-eastern city of Dnipro on the morning of Nov. 21, the Air Force reported earlier. At least two people were injured, and several buildings, including a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities, were damaged. The Air Force reported downing six of the cruise missiles. This would mark the first occasion of Russia deploying an ICBM in the war against Ukraine, coming shortly after the U.S. permitted Ukraine to carry out strikes in Russia with Western long-range missiles and Russia updated its nuclear deterrence policy. It remains unclear what type of ICBM was launched. The missile was launched from Astrakhan Oblast in southern Russia, over 700 kilometers (435 miles) east of Dnipro. &quot;We can see that Putin is using Ukraine as a training ground. We can see that he is afraid when people lead a normal life. When people have dignity,&quot; Zelensky said on the occasion of Ukraine&apos;s Day of Dignity and Freedom, commemorating the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2013-14. Ukraine&apos;s head of state reminded that Moscow seeks to obtain new missiles around the world, namely from North Korea and Iran. &quot;Putin is doing everything he can to prevent his neighbor from slipping out of his hands. And I thank all Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women who protect Ukraine from this evil - steadfastly, bravely, firmly,&quot; Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-icbm/	2024-11-21T04:14:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416230-1.jpg
Merkel describes Trump as 'fascinated by Putin' in her memoir	Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel described Donald Trump as &quot;fascinated by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin&quot; and &quot;by other authoritarian leaders,&quot; with a &quot;winner-or-loser mentality&quot; in excerpts from her new memoir published by Die Zeit on Nov. 21. Trump&apos;s relationship with Putin is coming into the spotlight as the former U.S. president is set to return to the White House in January, with far-ranging implications for Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. &quot;(Trump) saw everything from the point of view of a property developer, which is what he was before he came into politics. Every plot of land could only be sold once, and if he didn&apos;t get it, someone else would. That&apos;s how he saw the world,&quot; writes the former German politician in the book titled &quot;Freedom: Memories 1954-2021.&quot; &quot;Donald Trump asked me a series of questions, including about my East German origins and my relationship with Putin,&quot; she said. &quot;He was clearly fascinated by the Russian president.&quot; These assertions seem to align with what the U.S. president-elect, who had already sat in the Oval Office between 2017 and 2021, has shown so far. At the Helsinki summit in 2018, Trump went so far as to say publicly that he was prepared to trust the word of this dictator over his own intelligence services. During his time out of office, after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump again praised Putin for his audacity, and he told a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, that &quot;Putin is pretty smart,&quot; calling him a &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;savvy,&quot; as reported by Bloomberg. Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward reported that Trump spoke to Putin &quot;as many as seven times&quot; after he left the presidency and that at one point in 2024, Trump told a senior aide to leave the room at his mansion in Mar-a-Lago so &quot;he could have what he said was a private phone call&quot; with the Russian leader. Trump also said he could end the war in a day, something widely taken to mean he would force President Volodymyr Zelensky to make painful territorial concessions. Similarly, Putin has made positive comments about Trump recently. Commenting on the attempted assassination of Trump while he was speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July, Reuters reported Putin saying: &quot;He behaved, in my opinion, in a very correct way, courageously, like a real man.&quot; After his election, the Washington Post reported on Nov. 10 that Trump had a direct phone call with Putin, in which Trump allegedly advised Putin not to escalate the situation in Ukraine. The Kremlin denied that the call ever took place. On Nov. 20, Reuters reported that Putin was willing to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine with Donald Trump, citing five former and current Russian officials. Trump is a person &quot;under the spell of politicians with autocratic and dictatorial tendencies,&quot; Merkel described. The same tendency was supported by Politico, which described the U.S. president-elect as &quot;heaping praise on leaders who have praised him and gotten along with him in the past, or who he sees as strong figures on the world stage.&quot; In Trump&apos;s eyes, Putin probably possessed these qualities, as Merkel described him as &quot;a man who does not want to be disrespected and who is ready to pounce at any moment.&quot; Merkel also says Putin is determined to ensure that &quot;Russia will never disappear from the world map,&quot; a stance that would presumably embody Trump&apos;s vision of a &quot;strong figure on the world stage.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/merkel-trump-putin/	2024-11-21T03:40:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1060146212.jpg
Parliament passes bill allowing first-time deserters to return to military service	Ukraine&apos;s parliament passed a bill on Nov. 21 that will enable soldiers who deserted or were absent without leave (AWOL) for the first time to return and continue serving in the military. The contracts of these soldiers will continue to be valid if they voluntarily decide to return to their units. The bill comes amid broader legislative changes pertaining to draft and military service as Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces seek to replenish their ranks amid a grueling war with Russia. The legislation, supported by 253 lawmakers, will also ensure that the provision of relevant payments, social security, and other benefits to the soldiers resumes. The parliament previously decriminalized the first instances of desertion or going AWOL in August, provided the soldiers returned to their units. Earlier this month, the 53rd and the 57th mechanized brigades called on soldiers who left their units to return, saying that the &quot;door is open.&quot; &quot;We can all make mistakes - it&apos;s part of life. It&apos;s important to remember that one mistake does not define us completely,&quot; the statement of the 53rd Brigade read. &quot;We have one country, one goal, and we can only win together.&quot; Although Ukraine adopted a major bill reforming the draft in April, the mobilization draft slowed down in autumn, leaving many front-line units undermanned in the face of more numerous Russian troops. A further 160,000 people are to be drafted into the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which will raise the manning of units to 85%, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said on Oct. 29.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-passes-bill-allowing-first-time-deserters-return-to-military-service/	2024-11-21T03:17:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1643784971.jpg
Ukrainian UAVs reportedly strike Russian border regions, industrial facility hit	Russian authorities reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the border regions of Rostov and Voronezh on Nov. 21, claiming that an industrial facility had been hit. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that its forces intercepted two drones over the two regions, making no mention of possible damage or whether some of the drones slipped through the defenses. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said on his Telegram channel that a fire broke out at an industrial facility in the central Konstantinovsky district because of a &quot;drone crash.&quot; Slyusar claimed that firefighters quickly extinguished the fire. The type of the facility and the full extent of damage were not specified. Another drone was reportedly downed in Rostov Oblast&apos;s Myasnikovsky district, inflicting no damage. No casualties were reported. The airport in the city of Volgograd, lying northeast of Rostov Oblast, temporarily suspended operations due to safety concerns, the Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) reported. The Kyiv Independent could not verify all of the claims. Kyiv launches regular drone strikes against Russian territory, targeting military and industrial facilities to undermine Russia&apos;s war effort in Ukraine. Two industrial facilities &#x2013; including a factory producing cargo drones for the Russian military &#x2013; and a military arsenal were allegedly hit during drone attacks overnight on Nov. 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-uavs-reportedly-strike-russian-border-regions/	2024-11-21T02:37:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1690787546.jpg
Hungary deploys air defenses near Ukraine, cites war escalation after US allows strikes in Russia	Hungary is deploying air defense systems near the Ukrainian border, citing increased risks after the West allowed the use of long-range weapons inside Russian territory, Defense Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky said on Nov. 20. The minister ordered the deployment of air defense systems in the country&apos;s northeastern regions, saying that &quot;the war has entered its most dangerous phase.&quot; Szalay-Bobrovniczky attributed this escalation namely to the easing of restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with Western arms and linked it to Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s approval of an updated nuclear doctrine. This decision comes after two Russian missiles were shot down on Nov. 17 in Zakarpattia Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s westernmost region bordering Hungary and home to an estimated 75,000 ethnic Hungarians. On that occasion, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that it was necessary to &quot;strengthen efforts to bring peace&quot; as &quot;each day brings with it the risk of escalating war.&quot; Budapest has consistently criticized and obstructed Western military support for Ukraine, claiming it would lead to an escalation, and has maintained warm ties with Moscow throughout the full-scale war. Previously, Russian drones and missiles launched during strikes on Ukraine have crossed into the airspace of other countries, namely Poland, Latvia, Romania, Moldova, and Belarus. The latest development in Hungary follows a series of increasingly strong resolutions by Ukraine&apos;s Western allies. After U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged that the Biden administration would bolster support for Kyiv before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, President Joe Biden on Nov. 17 allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles to strike deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS missiles to strike a Russian military arsenal in Bryansk Oblast on Nov. 19 and allegedly also used U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow on Nov. 20, marking the first instance of these weapons being used on Russian soil. Other Western allies have expressed their position on their own supplied weapons. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Nov. 18 that Paris &quot;remained open&quot; to allowing Ukraine to use French long-range missiles to strike military targets inside Russia, reported Le Monde. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that she &quot;understands&quot; the U.S. response to Russia, but Rome makes a &quot;different choice&quot; and focuses on air defenses for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-deploys-air-defenses-near-ukraine/	2024-11-21T02:14:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1228238620.jpg
Russian attack on Kryvyi Rih injures 2, damages residential buildings	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an attack against the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Nov. 21, injuring at least two people, officials said. A 32-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman have been hospitalized and are in condition of moderate severity, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. An administrative building and two two-story residential buildings were damaged. The attack comes on the same day after Russia launched a large-scale missile attack against Dnipro, the regional center of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. According to the Air Force, Russia launched nine missiles against the city, including an intercontinental ballistic missile. This would mark the first time such a weapon was deployed in the war against Ukraine. Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelensky, remains a frequent target of Russia&apos;s missile attacks. With a population of around 660,000, it is the second-largest city in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city lies about 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the nearest front-line zone.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-kryvyi-rih/	2024-11-21T01:13:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1221388130.jpg
Russia reportedly launches intercontinental ballistic missile against Ukraine — what we know so far	Editor&apos;s note: This is a breaking story and will be updated regularly. Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) against Dnipro, east Ukraine on the morning of Nov. 21, Kyiv&apos;s Air Force reported. If confirmed, it would be the first time the Kremlin has used such a weapon in an attack on Ukraine. In the early hours of Nov. 21, a country-wide air raid alert sounded due to the threat of ballistic missiles, and later, the launch of several Russian Tu-95MS bomber aircraft. According to Ukraine&apos;s Air Force, the attack targeted the city of Dnipro using a number of different missile types. &quot;In particular, an intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation, an Kh-47M2 &apos;Kinzhal&apos; aeroballistic missile from a MiG-31K fighter jet was launched from the Tambov region, and seven Kh-101 cruise missiles were fired from Tu-95MS strategic bombers,&quot; the report said. The report did not specify what type of ICBM was launched. An industrial enterprise was damaged, and two fires broke out in the city, Governor Serhii Lysak said. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was damaged in the attack, Mayor Borys Filatov said. At least two people are reported to have been injured. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force said six of the Kh-101 missiles were reportedly shot down, but did not say if the reported ICBM had caused any of the damage in Dnipro. Russia regularly uses close, and short range ballistic missiles in aerial attacks against Ukraine, but ICBMs are far larger, can be equipped with nuclear payloads, and are designed to hit targets at far longer ranges.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-reportedly-launches-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-against-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far/	2024-11-21T01:09:25-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_7583.JPG
Russian troops suspected of executing Ukrainian POWs in Kursk Oblast, ombudsman says	Russian forces are suspected of summarily executing a group of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POW) in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported on Nov. 20. Lubinets said that the prisoners were &quot;surrounded&quot; but gave no other details, in particular on the number of victims. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian POWs are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. &quot;I have sent letters to the U.N. and the ICRC about this crime,&quot; Lubinets said, reporting the suspected crime on his Telegram channel. &quot;The international community must act immediately. The occupying country has once again violated the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war,&quot; he added. The Armyinform news outlet ties this announcement to a video taken by a drone camera purporting to show the execution. It shows 10 unarmed people lying on the ground with at least five armed men standing over them. &#xA0;At one point, they start shooting at the people on the ground. Heavy fighting has been ongoing in the Russian border region of Kursk since Ukraine launched an offensive there in early August. Earlier the same day, the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office announced another shooting of captured Ukrainian military personnel by Russian troops in the Pokrovsk area in Ukraine. Former Prosecutor General Kostin on Oct. 15 called the killing of captured Ukrainian service members in captivity a &quot;deliberate policy of the Russian Federation.&quot; The execution of prisoners of war constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Convention. Russian forces had executed at least 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022 as of Nov. 6, authorities said at the time, while the number continues to grow. On top of that, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity, according to a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-troops-suspected-of-executing-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk-oblast-ombudsman-says/	2024-11-21T00:51:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1752126648.jpg
Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant faces 2nd blackout of the week after Russian attacks	The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is on the verge of a blackout after Russian attacks on power lines left the plant connected to only one line, the Energy Ministry reported on Nov. 21. This is the second time this week that the plant has been seriously threatened by a blackout, which could compromise conditions for safe operation and cause an accident. At the moment, the plant is connected to the Ukrainian power grid by only one transmission line. Similar incidents have been reported throughout the full-scale war, with Kyiv accusing Russia of threatening the security of the plant. Russia has occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear station in Europe, since March 2022. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko confirmed that if the last line is cut off, there will be a complete blackout, as reported by the Energy Ministry&apos;s Telegram channel. The Zaporizhzhia plant is not the only one causing concern. The Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and Southern Ukrainian plants were forced to decrease output on Nov. 17 after a massive Russian aerial strike targeted several substations critical to their power supply. Greenpeace warned that Ukraine&apos;s power grid was at &quot;heightened risk of catastrophic failure&quot; after the mass missile and drone attack targeted the electrical substations. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, confirmed in a statement on Nov. 17 that Ukraine&apos;s nuclear power plants had to reduce their electricity production as a precautionary measure due to large-scale missile attacks. The attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s infrastructure led to &quot;increased nuclear safety and security risks,&quot; Grossi agreed. Allowing Ukraine to regain control &quot;is the only way to ensure the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,&quot; Halushchenko said.	https://kyivindependent.com/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-faces-2nd-blackout-of-the-week-after-russian-attacks/	2024-11-20T23:57:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1249892066.jpg
Belarusian who fought for Ukraine extradited from Vietnam to Belarus	Vasil Verameichyk, a former soldier of the Kalinouski Regiment fighting on Ukraine&apos;s side, was extradited from Vietnam to Belarus last week, the independent Belarusian outlet Zerkalo reported on Nov. 20. Verameichyk now faces imprisonment, as the Kalinouski Regiment was recently declared a terrorist organization by the Supreme Court of Belarus. The Belarusian regime under dictator Alexander Lukashenko has backed Russia in its aggression against Ukraine and cracked down on Belarusian citizens actively supporting Kyiv. Verameichyk supported the 2020 protests against the electoral fraud in Belarus and then fled to Ukraine. There he joined Kastus Kalinouski&apos;s regiment at the beginning of the full-scale war and fought on the Ukrainian side, according to Ukrainska Pravda. Verameichyk later moved from Ukraine to Lithuania, where he was allegedly denied a residence permit because of his past service in the Belarusian army. According to Belarusian media, he was arrested in Vietnam on Nov. 13 and extradited to Belarus the following day. The Kalinouski Regiment is a military formation within Ukrainian forces, created in March 2022 to protect Ukraine from Russian invasion. It is composed of Belarusian volunteers. In September, another fighter from the regiment who had been held in Russian captivity for two years was charged with mercenarism by Russian proxy authorities in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast. Following the Supreme Court&apos;s decision, Alexander Karpovich, head of the Belarusian Prosecutor General&apos;s Office, said that members of the regiment had allegedly recruited, armed, and trained &quot;terrorists&quot; and had been involved in financing &quot;terrorist activities.&quot; &quot;On the basis of the provided evidence, the involvement of extremist-minded citizens, who are part of this formation, in the organization, planning, preparation, and commission of acts of terrorism on the territory of the Republic of Belarus was established,&quot; he added. The Belarusian regime brutally suppresses dissent at home, using surveillance, violence, and trumped-up charges with lengthy sentences to intimidate any opposition.	https://kyivindependent.com/belarusian-who-fought-for-ukraine-extradited-from-vietnam-to-belarus/	2024-11-20T23:33:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1473663322--2-.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 3, injure 22 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least three people and injured at least 22 over the past day, including a child, regional authorities reported on Nov. 21. Russian forces launched a large-missile missile early on Nov. 21, reportedly lifting Tu-95 bombers and MiG-31K Kinzhal carriers and attacking the city of Dnipro. According to Telegram monitoring channels, Russian forces attacked the city with ballistic, cruise, and air-launched Kinzhal missiles. An industrial enterprise was damaged, and two fires broke out in the city, Governor Serhii Lysak said. A rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was damaged in the attack, Mayor Borys Filatov said. No casualties were reported at the moment. In Donetsk Oblast, a Russian attack against the village of Pershomarivka killed one person and injured two, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Six people were reportedly injured during an attack against the town of Kostiantynivka. Russian attacks against Kherson Oblast overnight and on Nov. 20 killed one person and injured 10, including a child, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. A 62-year-old woman was also killed during an attack against the Darivka village on the morning of Nov. 21, the governor said. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 64-year-old woman was injured in an attack against the village Vysokyi, and two men aged 42 and 64 were wounded in strikes against the town of Kupiansk, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported. A civilian was injured during Russian attacks against the Krasnopillia community in Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration said.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-across-ukraine-2/	2024-11-20T22:57:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-21_06-37-10.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 727,250 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 727,250 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 21. This number includes 1,510 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day. According to the report, Russia has also lost 9,398 tanks, 19,143 armored fighting vehicles, 29,745 vehicles and fuel tanks, 20,731 artillery systems, 1,253 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,003 air defense systems, 369 airplanes, 329 helicopters, 19,259 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.	https://kyivindependent.com/general-staff-russia-has-lost-727-250-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24-2022/	2024-11-20T22:10:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2003914665.jpg
Russia, North Korea agree to increase charter flights following trade discussions, media reports	North Korea and Russia have signed a protocol on cooperation following discussions on trade, the economy, science, and technology, North Korean state media KCNA reported on Nov. 21. While the KCNA report provided few specifics, Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS news agency reported that the two countries had agreed to boost charter flights. The agreement was confirmed by Russia&#x2019;s Ministry of Natural Resources, which noted that between January and September, over 5,000 tourists traveled between the two countries, with more than 70% of them flying. North Korea and Russia have significantly strengthened their relations over the past two years, particularly in the context of mutual military support and geopolitical alignment against Western nations, posing significant challenges to international stability. The increased charter flights will operate not only from Russia&#x2019;s eastern regions near North Korea but also from major cities across the country, Russia&apos;s TASS added. The Russian delegation, led by Minister of Natural Resources Alexander Kozlov, met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Nov. 18. During the visit, the Russian government also presented zoo animals, including an African lion and two brown bears, sent from Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin as gifts to North Korea. In April, Russia donated eagles, cranes, and parrots to the Pyongyang Central Zoo, according to Reuters. During Putin&#x2019;s visit to North Korea in June, the leaders agreed on a mutual defense pact. The strengthening of defense relations has raised concerns internationally, with Washington, Kyiv, and Seoul condemning North Korea for supplying military equipment and sending over 10,000 troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-north-korea-agree-to-increase-charter-flights-following-trade-discussions-media-reports/	2024-11-20T19:49:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157649988.jpg
SBU exposes corruption scheme by two Ukrainian army logistics officers	Ukraine&#x2019;s Security Service (SBU) has uncovered a corruption scheme involving two logistics command officers of the Armed Forces, according to a Nov. 20 report. Investigators, working with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and with support from Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and senior military leaders, found that the suspects signed contracts in 2022 and 2023 to purchase fighter jet spare parts at inflated prices. The investigation revealed that the parts were supplied by a company linked to the officers. To secure the contracts, the suspects allegedly used multiple affiliated commercial entities, some registered abroad, to simulate a competitive bidding process. The scheme is believed to have defrauded the state of Hr 27.3 million ($662,000), which was funneled through a network of shell companies. If convicted, the accused face up to six years in prison. This is not the first investigation by NABU into high-profile corruption. On July 16, then-Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin said that two prosecutors from the Prosecutor General&apos;s Office were under investigation for allegedly accepting a $170,000 bribe to close a criminal case. One of the prosecutors was charged and detained at their workplace following a probe by NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office (SAPO).	https://kyivindependent.com/sbu-exposes-corruption-scheme-by-two-ukrainian-army-logistics-officers/	2024-11-20T18:30:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/79903c7fcbd4195421755ad52552f162.jpg
UK defense secretary does not confirm Ukraine's Storm Shadow strike in Russia	U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey on Nov. 20 declined to confirm reports that Ukraine used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike targets within Russia. &quot;We have seen, over recent weeks, a significant change in the action and in the rhetoric on Ukraine, and Ukraine&apos;s action on the battlefield speaks for itself,&quot; Healey told members of parliament on Nov. 20. &#xA0; Healey&apos;s comments followed reports that Ukraine struck a military facility in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast with Storm Shadows, marking the first time Kyiv has used the long-range British missiles on Russian soil. Healey did not confirm the reports, but said he had met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov the previous day to discuss &quot;Ukraine&apos;s robust response to recent Russian escalations.&quot; Those escalations, Healey said, include Russia&apos;s mass attacks against Ukrainian cities and the deployment of North Korean troops alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast. The ministers discussed the U.K.&apos;s plans to continue supporting Ukraine through the end of 2025, Healey said. &quot;(A)t this point, I am not able to go into any further operational details,&quot; he said. The reported Storm Shadow strike came a day after Ukraine allegedly used U.S.-made ATACMS to attack Russian territory for the first time, following outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s approval on Nov. 17. Different versions of Storm Shadow missiles have a range of 250-560 kilometers. Storm Shadows have previously been used to hit Russian military targets in occupied Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-defense-secretary-does-not-confirm-ukraines-storm-shadow-strike-in-russia/	2024-11-20T16:00:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184908975.jpg
Russian attack in Donetsk Oblast kills 11-year-old boy	Russia attacked a village in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 20, killing an 11-year-old boy and seriously injuring his 13-year-old sister, regional police reported. A 63-year-old man was also hospitalized with multiple injuries following the attack, police said. Russia launched Tornado multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) armed with cluster munitions at Pershomaryivka in Donetsk Oblast&apos;s Kramatorsk district at around 3:45 p.m. local time, police reported. The attack struck the yard of a home, instantly killing an 11-year-old boy. His sister, age 13, sustained shrapnel wounds and is in serious condition. She is being treated at a medical facility in Dnipro. A 63-year-old man was also injured and hospitalized. Russian artillery and aerial attacks against Donetsk Oblast settlements are a daily occurrence, regularly resulting in civilian deaths and injuries. The region is also the main target of Russia&apos;s latest offensive push. The district center of Kramatorsk is currently located around 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the front line.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-in-donetsk-oblast-kills-11-year-old-boy/	2024-11-20T15:13:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/donetsk.jpg
Ukraine to pursue 'diplomatic' liberation of Crimea, will not acknowledge occupied territories as Russian, Zelensky says	Ukraine &quot;cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said when asked about ceding land to Russia in exchange for peace during an interview with Fox News published Nov. 20. While Kyiv has consistently rejected territorial concessions as the basis of peace talks, the election of Donald Trump has raised fears that Ukraine may be pushed to the negotiating table under threat of the withdrawal of U.S. aid. Fox News correspondent Trey Yingst asked Zelensky if he would accept loss of territory to Russia as part of a peace deal. &quot;We cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;That is about those territories... occupied by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin before the full-scale invasion, since 2014. Legally, we are not acknowledging that, we are not adopting that.&quot; Yingst also asked Zelensky if he would be willing to give up Russian-occupied Crimea, illegally annexed since 2014, in order to &quot;stop the bloodshed in Europe.&quot; Zelensky said Ukraine was prepared to pursue a diplomatic approach to Crimea&apos;s liberation. &quot;I was already mentioning that we are ready to bring Crimea back diplomatically,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot spend dozens of thousands of our people so that they perish for the sake of Crimea coming back ... We understand that Crimea can be brought back diplomatically.&quot; This is not a new line for Zelensky, who told Reuters in 2022 that Crimea could be returned by diplomatic means.&quot; Following the unveiling of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan for Ukraine this fall, Ukrainian lawmakers also acknowledged that some territories might be returned through diplomacy rather than military means. Republican party strategist Bryan Lanza said on Nov. 9 that Zelensky should accept that &quot;Crimea is gone&quot; ahead of any future peace talks, though the Trump team later distanced itself from Lanza&apos;s comments. Putin said on Nov. 20 that he is willing to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine with Trump, but would not make major territorial concessions and would insist that Kyiv abandon plans to join NATO. Moscow currently holds the advantage on the battlefield in Ukraine, and it is unclear why Russia would choose to pause at its current phase. A growing number of Ukrainians favor a negotiated end to the war, according to a recent Gallup poll. A significant majority of respondents said they would prefer peace talks be brokered by Europe or the U.K. over the U.S. led by Trump.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-to-pursue-diplomatic-liberation-of-crimea-will-not-acknowledge-occupied-territories-as-russian-zelensky-says/	2024-11-20T14:41:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178140389.jpg
Biden seeks to cancel over $4.5 billion in Ukraine's debt	U.S. President Joe Biden has submitted to Congress a statement of intent to cancel half of Ukraine&apos;s economic aid debt, a sum of around $4.65 billion, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a press briefing on Nov. 20. The supplemental security assistance package worth $61 billion that Congress provided to Ukraine in April included about $10 billion in economic aid as a loan, rather than a grant. The terms of the offer gave Biden the authority to forgive up to 50 percent of the loan. &quot;We have taken the step that was outlined in the law to cancel those loans, provide that economic assistance to Ukraine, and now Congress is welcome to take it up if they wish,&quot; Miller told reporters. Miller said Biden&apos;s statement of intent was delivered to Congress within the last week. While Congress does have the option to overturn the president&apos;s request, Miller said he expected U.S. lawmakers to support the debt cancellation. &quot;I would be surprised if Congress took that step (to overturn the request) given the overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress for providing assistance, but we will follow the law,&quot; he said. With only two months until President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the Biden administration has pledged to shore up support for Kyiv before the presidential transition. Biden has promised to deliver the remaining $6 billion in allocated aid to Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration. He has also approved the delivery of anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine and reportedly authorized Kyiv to strike targets in Russia with long-range ATACMS missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-seeks-to-cancel-over-4-5-billion-in-ukraines-debt/	2024-11-20T13:54:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-1850718732.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine reportedly strikes Russia with Storm Shadow missiles for first time	Key developments on Nov. 20: Ukraine has struck targets inside Russia with British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for the first time, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 20, citing a Western official familiar with the matter. According to the source, the strikes were approved as a response to the presence of North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, a sign of escalation by Russia. Different versions of Storm Shadow missiles have a range of between 250 and 560 kilometers. Storm Shadows have been used to hit Russian military targets in Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia. The reported strikes come a day after Ukraine reportedly used U.S.-made ATACMS long-range missiles to attack Russian territory, following outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s approval on Nov. 17. That strike reportedly hit a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. U.S. President Joe Biden has approved the provision of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Nov. 20. The decision is expected to help slow down Russia&apos;s advance in the east of the country. The move follows the Biden administration&apos;s authorization of the use of U.S.-made long-range missiles to strike Russian territory. Kyiv has not officially confirmed the claims, but recent reports indicate Ukraine deployed U.S. ATACMS missiles in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast. The transfer of anti-personnel mines could be controversial, as it contradicts the Ottawa Convention, also known as the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty, which has been signed by more than 160 countries. Russia and the U.S. are not signatories to this initiative. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Washington has been supplying Kyiv with anti-tank mines, while Ukrainian forces have been looking for opportunities to obtain infantry mines over the past three years. Moscow has used anti-personnel mines without restriction at the front line, hampering the progress of the Ukrainian military. Biden was reluctant to supply Ukraine with mines due to doubts in his administration and the risk to civilians. Yet Washington is now concerned about Russia&apos;s rapid advance in eastern Ukraine and sees the need to halt it, U.S. officials told the WP. &quot;Russia is attacking Ukrainian lines in the east with waves of troops, regardless of the casualties that they&apos;re suffering,&quot; one of the officials said. &quot;So, the Ukrainians are obviously taking losses, and more towns and cities are at risk of falling. These mines were made specifically to combat exactly this.&quot; One U.S. official described the mines for Ukraine as &quot;non-resistant,&quot; meaning that they self-destruct or lose battery power to render them inactive within days or weeks, reducing the danger to civilians, the WP reported. The official said Kyiv had committed to not installing these mines in densely populated areas. Ukraine reportedly targeted Russian facilities with drones as the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 20 that air defense forces shot down 44 drones overnight. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that drone wreckage damaged the premises of an enterprise in the town of Alekseevka on Nov. 19. Media reports identified the facility as an EFKO plant, officially a sauce manufacturer. Separately, drone strikes were reported also in Voronezh Oblast, with local authorities claiming that five drones struck a civilian industrial facility, starting a fire. The Voronezh and Belgorod oblasts lie at the border with Ukraine and are regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council&apos;s counter-disinformation center, said that the EFKO plant also secretly produces cargo drones used by the Russian military. The official said that Ukrainian drones also attacked the 13th Arsenal of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry (GRAU) near Kotovo in Novgorod Oblast, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) from Ukraine&apos;s border. According to Kovalenko, the arsenal stores critical military supplies, including artillery shells, multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) missiles, Iskander and anti-aircraft missiles, and ammunition for various systems, including the Tor complex. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 22 drones were shot down over Novgorod Oblast overnight. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. These strikes come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced plans on Nov. 19 to scale up domestic production of long-range drones and missiles. As part of Ukraine&apos;s resilience plan, the country aims to manufacture at least 30,000 long-range drones in the coming year and establish a new technology center to enhance its defense capabilities. Ukrainian forces struck a military arsenal in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast, overnight on Nov. 19, with some reports indicating that Kyiv deployed U.S. ATACMS missiles for the first time on Russian soil. Colonel General Kim Yong Bok, one of the generals accompanying North Korean troops in Russia, is a mystery-shrouded figure close to dictator Kim Jong Un, The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 20. Kim Yong Bok, officially the Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, is expected to oversee the integration of North Korean troops into Russian forces, gain combat experience, and establish a framework for future deployments, the outlet reports. A Ukrainian envoy listed him, along with Major General Sin Kum Cheol and Colonel General Ri Chang Ho, during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Oct. 30 as one of the generals commanding some over 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia. Kim&apos;s role in Pyongyang&apos;s military has long been shrouded in secrecy. He previously commanded a special forces unit of 200,000 soldiers tasked with covert missions on the Korean Peninsula. His profile was elevated after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea in June, with reports identifying him as the No. 3 figure in the Korean People&apos;s Army, according to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s reporting. In July 2020, Kim was seen alongside Kim Jong Un at a ceremony honoring military officials but largely disappeared from public view until recently. This deployment coincides with North Korea&apos;s formalized mutual defense treaty with Russia, announced on Nov. 12. The agreement obligates the nations to assist each other in the event of an armed attack. The development follows reports of initial clashes between Ukrainian forces and North Korean troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The Western countries denounced the deployment of North Korean troops as an escalation, with the U.S. reportedly responding by permitting Ukraine to launch ATACMS missiles against Russian and North Korean troops amassing in the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump but rejects major territorial concessions and insists that Ukraine abandon plans to join NATO, Reuters reported on Nov. 20, citing five former and current Russian officials. The Kremlin&apos;s terms reportedly include freezing the conflict roughly along current front lines and &quot;dividing control&quot; of eastern regions, including the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Moscow, which illegally declared annexation of these regions in September 2022, currently controls only 70-80% of them, with approximately 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 square miles) under Ukrainian control. Putin issued a demand in June that Ukraine must withdraw from the four regions completely before any ceasefire talks. Russia currently occupies roughly a fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory &#x2013; including Crimea &#x2013; as its forces continue to steadily advance in the east. Publicly, the Kremlin has rejected freezing the front line or any concessions on its part, with Putin saying any peace deal must be in Moscow&apos;s favor. According to Reuters, Russian officials suggested that Moscow might consider withdrawing from smaller occupied areas in Ukraine&apos;s Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions but emphasized that any deal must reflect &quot;realities&quot; on the ground. Moscow remains firmly opposed to NATO membership for Ukraine or the presence of foreign troops on Ukrainian soil, the officials said. Additional demands could reportedly include limiting Ukraine&apos;s military size and guaranteeing unrestricted use of the Russian language. Ukraine has rejected territorial concessions and said any peace talks should be based on its 10-point peace formula, which includes a Russian withdrawal and full territorial integrity and sovereignty. Officials acknowledged that some territories might be returned through diplomacy rather than military means. Kyiv also said that NATO membership is the only way to prevent further Russian aggression. Without a ceasefire, Russia will continue the war, Kremlin sources told Reuters. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the U.S. authorization of ATACMS missiles a &quot;very dangerous escalation.&quot; Trump has positioned himself as a potential peace broker, claiming he could negotiate an end to the war. The contours of Trump&apos;s peace plan remain unclear, though media reports indicate it might entail postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership for 20 years, freezing the front line, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east manned by European troops. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Nov. 19 that Moscow &quot;will respond accordingly&quot; to Washington&apos;s permission for Ukraine to strike Russian soil with U.S. weapons. Speaking at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Lavrov referred to Russia&apos;s updated nuclear doctrine, which permits nuclear retaliation for attacks by non-nuclear states supported by nuclear powers. When asked during the summit if the U.S. had authorized Ukraine to use long-range weapons to target Russia, Lavrov responded, &quot;I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s true or not. We are focused on ensuring our security.&quot; &quot;We have already stated everything necessary to those considering this, officially. The president said it, and now it&apos;s confirmed in an official document,&quot; he said, according to TASS. On Nov. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved an updated nuclear deterrence policy that expands the conditions for a nuclear strike. The revised doctrine outlines scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike, suggesting that this could include &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-strikes-russia-with-british-for-first-time-media-reports/	2024-11-20T13:15:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163690000.jpg
Trump names Matthew Whitaker as next US ambassador to NATO	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump named Matthew Whitaker, former acting attorney general, as the next U.S. ambassador to NATO, according to a statement released Nov. 20. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, 25, has been assembling appointees for his upcoming administration, often prizing loyalty over policy expertise. Some nominees have raised alarm, particularly the choice of Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary and Congressman Mike Waltz as national security advisor. Whitaker&apos;s nomination comes amid concerns that a Trump administration would dramatically reduce U.S. investment in the NATO alliance. &quot;Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability &#x2014; He will put AMERICA FIRST,&quot; Trump&apos;s statement read. There is little known about Whitaker&apos;s foreign policy positions. He worked as a U.S. attorney for the southern district of Iowa before joining the Justice Department in 2017 as Attorney General Jeff Sessions&apos; chief of staff. He then served briefly as acting attorney general after Sessions resigned at Trump&apos;s request. Whitaker has no evident experience in national security, diplomacy, or foreign policy. Whitaker will be a key figure in selling Trump&apos;s much-touted peace deal between Russia and Ukraine to NATO member nations. Trump frequently promised to effect such a deal within &quot;24 hours&quot; of his election. One idea Trump&apos;s team has put forth for ending Russia&apos;s war involves delaying Kyiv&apos;s NATO membership for at least 20 years in exchange for continued arms supplies, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Nov. 6, citing three sources close to Trump. Ukraine submitted a request for NATO membership in 2022 but has not received an invitation, in part because the country is actively at war. NATO accession is also a core component of President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s five-part victory plan, but Kyiv&apos;s bid for membership received a cold response from U.S. President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and other leaders.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-names-matthew-whitaker-as-next-us-ambassador-to-nato/	2024-11-20T13:11:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2165596076.jpg
Russian troops killed 2 Ukrainian POWs near Pokrovsk, prosecutors say	Russian troops have killed two Ukrainian prisoners of war in Donetsk Oblast&apos;s Pokrovsk District, the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor&apos;s Office said on Nov. 20. They were stripped naked and shot dead, according to the prosecutors. In a picture published by the prosecutors, two blurred naked bodies are seen lying on the ground. &#x201C;On Nov. 10, the enemy stormed our fortifications near the village of Novodmytrivka, Pokrovsk district,&#x201D; the prosecutors said. &#x201C;After the Russian army captured two Ukrainian soldiers, they forced the men to strip naked. After being led at gunpoint through a forest plantation, the prisoners were shot dead.&#x201D; The prosecutor&#x2019;s office said that it is also investigating whether Russian soldiers killed three more Ukrainian prisoners. Reports of murders, torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war are received regularly by Ukrainian authorities and have spiked in recent months. Most cases were recorded in embattled Donetsk Oblast. Russian forces had executed at least 124 Ukrainian prisoners of war since 2022 as of Nov. 6. On top of that, at least 177 Ukrainian prisoners have died in Russian captivity, according to a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. On one occasion, a photo of an apparently executed Ukrainian soldier with a sword in his chest and the inscription &quot;For Kursk&quot; has appeared on social media, with remnants of gray tape visible on the soldier&apos;s hand. Executing prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-military-reportedly-stripped-and-shot-two-ukrainain-pows-in-the-pokrovsk-region/	2024-11-20T12:36:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2075450212.jpg
Secret Russian plan sees Ukraine cut into 3 parts, intelligence source confirms	Russia will try to convey to U.S. leadership its plan for a new world order up to the year 2045, including a scheme to break Ukraine up into three parts, the Interfax Ukraine news agency reported on Nov. 20. An intelligence community source confirmed the existence of the plan to the Kyiv Independent. According to the plan, developed by the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine would be divided into thirds. The country&apos;s western lands would be offered to neighboring countries, including Poland, Hungary, and Romania. The eastern regions, including partially and fully Russian-occupied territories, &#xA0;would be annexed by Russia. The remaining territory, including Kyiv, would become a Russian-controlled puppet state. The plan envisages the effective dissolution of the independent Ukrainian state. The Russian Defense Ministry also put forward four different scenarios of global world order development &#x2014; two seen as favorable to Moscow and two disadvantageous. Two of the scenarios, labeled &quot;Formation of a multipolar world and the division of spheres of influence by leading actors&quot; and &quot;Regionalization/chaotization,&quot; involve a Russian victory over Ukraine. The others, &quot;Dominance of the USA and the West&quot; and &quot;Acquisition by China of the status of the world&apos;s leading power,&quot; presuppose a military defeat in Ukraine. The latest plan marks another Russian attempt to put forward suggestions for the disruption and recreation of a global world order. The Kremlin convened meetings in 2022 and 2023 to find ways to dismantle the post-World War II global financial system and undermine U.S. power over global transactions, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post. &quot;One of the most important tasks is to create a new world order,&quot; one of the documents dated April 3, 2023, reportedly said. &quot;Western countries led by the United States have tried to impose their own structure, based on their dominance.&quot; The new plan&apos;s proposed breakup of Ukraine reflects the maximalist goals of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, which include regime change in Kyiv and &quot;demilitarization&quot; of the Ukrainian state.	https://kyivindependent.com/secret-russian-plan-sees-ukraine-cut-into-3-parts-intelligence-source-confirms/	2024-11-20T12:35:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1251911412.jpg
Panic grips Kyiv as embassy closures and Telegram rumors fuel fears of imminent attack	Ukrainians woke up on Nov. 20 to a message that a number of foreign embassies were closing their Kyiv offices &#x2014; a stark reminder of the departure of foreign diplomats from Kyiv days before the start of the all-out war. The U.S. Embassy in the capital said it had received &quot;specific information&quot; about a &quot;potential significant air attack&quot; planned for that day. &quot;Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,&quot; the statement read. The announcement came in the wake of what appeared to be Ukraine&apos;s first successful strike of a military target inside Russia using the U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. After depicting such a move as crossing another &quot;red line&quot; the Kremlin had drawn, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country would respond. A mass attack using cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as drones, was the most expected outcome. Throughout the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has repeatedly laid down red lines, the crossing of which it has said could provoke various responses, sometimes invoking the threat of nuclear weapons. In an attempt to deter Ukraine&apos;s Western allies from further arming Kyiv, the Kremlin issued warnings related to the supply of Patriot air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets, and ATACMS to be used in occupied areas of Ukraine, among others. Despite crossing multiple red lines on multiple occasions, Russia has yet to follow through with any of its threats. What has spooked some observers about the latest crossing is that it happened just hours before Putin approved the updated principles of Russia&apos;s nuclear deterrence policy. One of the provisions of the new policy states that &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; could justify a nuclear strike &#x2014; Ukraine using ATACMS to strike deep inside Russia would appear to qualify. Shortly after the U.S. Embassy issued its warning, the Spanish, Greek, and Italian embassies followed suit, and the news quickly spread on Ukrainian Telegram channels. Most of them urged that on this day, it&apos;s especially worth taking shelter during air raid alerts. In central Kyiv, there were mixed responses to the reports. Nina Stupak, 83, said she hadn&apos;t seen the specific warning from the U.S. embassy, but her neighbors had called her to tell her about it. &quot;Of course, I am really scared about this threat, and especially I am worried about the lives of my children and grandchildren,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent while out shopping in the city&apos;s Podil district. Petro Karpenko, an 18-year-old student, was more blas&#xE9;. &quot;I am not worried because there is a stable situation in Kyiv,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;There have already been massive attacks on Kyiv from May to July. I&apos;ve got used to it more or less.&quot; Shortly after midday, Andrii Kovalenko of Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council, repeated an appeal he issued earlier in the morning, stating that Russian mass aerial attacks have been in the planning for months, and the embassy closures shouldn&apos;t mean Ukrainians act any differently. &quot;Ukrainians already understand the situation &#x2014; you need to plan your time and prepare safe places for yourself in case of alarm, calculate the route and the time it takes to reach these safe places can be reached,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. Kovalenko, who heads the counter-disinformation department, added that Russia was trying to exploit the situation by &quot;stoking panic against the backdrop of the closing of embassies.&quot; Local residents take shelter in a metro station during an air strike alarm in Kyiv, Ukraine on Nov. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)But the warnings weren&apos;t just limited to diplomats and Telegram channels &#x2014; Ukrainian soldiers were also alerted about a potential Russian mass ballistic missile attack, a source in the Ukrainian military told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;According to intelligence reports, a massive missile attack using ballistic missiles is possible today,&quot; a message received by Ukrainian soldiers said. When asked about the alert, at least one Ukrainian soldier was unmoved by the apparent threat. &quot;In case anyone hasn&apos;t noticed, we are at war with Russia,&quot; Lieutenant Colonel Bohdan Krotevych, chief of staff of Azov 12th Special Forces Brigade, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Yesterday was no different from the days before it or those to come. Russia doesn&apos;t need to adopt any doctrines to use one weapon or another. This topic isn&apos;t even worth discussing.&quot; Further stoking tensions were reports in Ukrainian media about rumors of Russia testing new weapons as part of their planned retaliation. &quot;According to unconfirmed information, it is an RS-26 &apos;Rubezh&apos; intercontinental (ballistic) missile,&quot; one outlet wrote in an article published at 1:45 p.m. At 1:49 p.m., the air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv and several other oblasts. An almost everyday occurrence, after more than two-and-a-half years of full-scale war, they rarely cause anyone to blink, let alone head to a shelter. But today was different &#x2014; many of those on the streets changed direction and quickened their pace, heading to the nearest metro station, the safest place to be during an attack.&quot; Usually, I do not go down to the metro or shelter because I am not really worried about attacks,&quot; 24-year-old Andriy Bohdantsov told the Kyiv Independent from the underground metro station where hundreds of people had gathered. &quot;But today, due to the U.S. Embassy warning, I&apos;ve decided to come here. &quot;For me, this situation today is like a flashback of past events, specifically, when people were saying that war wouldn&apos;t start, but it had started,&quot; he added, referring to the days leading up to the launch of the full-scale invasion in 2022 when constant U.S. intelligence assessments warning of an imminent attack were played down by Ukrainian authorities. The closure of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on Feb. 14, 2022, ten days before the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, has been engraved in the memories of many Ukrainians who were left to witness the unfolding war. Telegram channels that monitor Russian missile launches reported two ballistic missiles heading for Kyiv, but shortly after said they had &quot;ceased to exist&quot; &#x2014; either being intercepted, or being fake launches using electronic warfare (EW). At 2:21 p.m. the all clear sounded, and hundreds of people filed out of the metro to resume their day as best they could. At exactly the same time, Kovalenko&apos;s warnings about a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at stoking panic in Kyiv appeared to be confirmed. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) warned on its Telegram channel that Russian intelligence services were amplifying the panic by spreading fake messages in messengers and social media about the supposedly upcoming attack. The agency showed one message about the attack spread in messengers and social media, saying it was &quot;fake and contains grammatical errors typical for Russian psychological operations.&quot; &quot;The enemy, unable to subjugate Ukrainians by force, resorts to measures of intimidation and psychological pressure on society. Please be vigilant,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Do not ignore air raid signals&#x2014;it is safer to wait in a shelter. However, we urge you not to panic.&quot; A woman walks past the US Embassy in Kyiv on Nov. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Tanya Dzafarowa / AFP via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent&apos;s military source clarified that the aerial strike threat remains relevant, but Russia is carrying out a parallel psychological operation to sow panic. At around 3 p.m., Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry released a statement criticizing the decision of Western embassies to issue warnings and close earlier in the day, describing the moves as &quot;information overreaction.&quot; &quot;On this 1,001st day of the full-scale invasion, the threat of Russian strikes remains just as relevant as it has been for the past thousand days,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said. Around the same time, Telegram monitoring channels reported seven Russian Tu-95 bombers were redeploying to the Engels airbase, a possible indication of preparation for an attack. At 7:46 p.m., other channels reported they had been joined there by a further two Tu-95s. Around an hour later, the U.S. Embassy &#xA0;it had &quot;resumed services following a temporary shelter-in-place suspension earlier today.&quot; &quot;We continue to encourage U.S. citizens to remain vigilant, monitor official Ukrainian sources for updates, and be prepared to shelter in place if an air alert is announced,&quot; it added. At the time of writing, 10:00 p.m., there have been no further air raid alerts in Kyiv, no further embassy warnings, and little further information on the Russian bombers, and even less on what their plans for attack might be. Martyniuk Oksana, a 26-year-old mother currently on maternity leave, told the Kyiv Independent that given all the information being pumped out by embassies, social media, and government officials, it was &quot;understandable that there is confusion. &quot;Of course, I am scared of this situation, and I can only hope there will not be a massive attack.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/panic-grips-kyiv-as-embassy-closures-and-telegram-rumors-fuel-fears-of-imminent-attack/	2024-11-20T12:19:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185112049.jpg
Russia only wins if the West quits' — Gen. Ben Hodges	The first reports of Ukraine striking deep inside Russia with U.S.-supplied ATACMS emerged on Nov. 19, marking a long-awaited shift in White House policy that could bolster Ukraine&apos;s defense against a 50,000-strong joint Russian-North Korean force assembled against them. President Joe Biden&apos;s decision to finally grant Kyiv permission to use ATACMS is likely one of the last significant contributions to the war in Ukraine before Donald Trump takes up residence in the White House on Jan. 20. With election promises of ending the war in &quot;24 hours,&quot; and cabinet appointments marked equally by inexperience and disdain for the fate of Ukraine, a Trump-led U.S. will have a profoundly different stance towards Kyiv than the previous administration. A few hours before reports of the strikes in Bryansk Oblast, the Kyiv Independent sat down with retired U.S. General Ben Hodges for his take on ATACMS, the prospect of peace negotiations, and how he feels personally about Ukraine&apos;s future. Editor&apos;s note: This is a transcript of the video interview that has been edited for clarity and brevity. The Kyiv Independent: This week, we heard the news that the Biden administration is going to authorize long-range strikes inside Russia. What do you think is the significance of the timing? Ben Hodges: I&apos;m not sure why this finally happened. Obviously this is something that should have happened two years ago. I&apos;m glad it did happen, but I&apos;m not sure what finally caused it. Perhaps it had something to do with North Korea&apos;s involvement. I&apos;m not sure. I am still frustrated that it&apos;s not a complete lifting of restrictions, that it still applies only to use against Russian and North Korean forces that are attacking the Kursk bridgehead. So it&apos;s better than nothing, but it still falls short of what&apos;s actually needed. The Kyiv Independent: A lot of people have pointed out that this probably won&apos;t be a game changer, but what will Ukraine be able to do now that it wasn&apos;t able to do before? Ben Hodges: I&apos;ve never liked the phrase &apos;game changer&apos; because the only thing that would really be a game changer would be if the Bidenadministration, and other European governments would say, &quot;we want Ukraine to actually win this war&quot; and then commit to that. New weapons or permissions by themselves are not game changing. Nonetheless, this is still a positive step. I would anticipate that the Ukrainian General Staff will use these to target Russian headquarters, logistics, and artillery. That&apos;s how you defeat mass, and mass is the only advantage that the Russian forces have, the big numbers (of troops). And if you can destroy the headquarters that are necessary to coordinate their movements and their support, if you can destroy the artillery that enables their attacks, and if you can destroy the logistics that provide the artillery ammunition, then I think you can really degrade the effectiveness of Russian mass attacks.

(Yevhenii Vasyliev/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)The Kyiv Independent: With the election of Donald Trump, there&apos;s a sort of a deadline now. Trump has said he&apos;s going to try and stop or freeze the war quickly. Do you think the timing of the decision for ATACMS has that in mind? Ben Hodges: The Biden administration would certainly have been very conscious of the fact that the inauguration is only two months away, and that possibly influenced the thinking somehow. I&apos;m not sure. But as I reflected on this all day yesterday, this is actually a gift from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, to have this policy in place so the Trump administration can just leave it (in place) or use it as a point of increased leverage against the Russians &#x2014; or not. Of course, I don&apos;t know what the Trump administration is going to do based on everything they&apos;ve said during the campaign. I&apos;m not hopeful that they&apos;re going to be supportive of Ukraine, but I am hopeful that the leadership of the Republican Party in Congress, both in the Senate and in the House, who are mostly pro-Ukraine, pro-NATO, pro-transatlantic, will be able to convey to the new administration how important it is that the United States to not turn its back on Ukraine. We&apos;ll see if they have the ability and the courage to push back against Trump&apos;s designs to end the war in 24 hours. And, of course, these kinds of ridiculous assertions that he can end the war in 24 hours or freeze it somehow assume that Ukraine will just go along with it or that Eastern European countries &#x2014; who are not confused about the threat that is Russia &#x2014; that they&apos;ll just go along with it. I doubt that&apos;s the case because most of them know that they will end up paying the price if this conflict is frozen. None of them believe for a second that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would ever live up to any agreement. So I think once the Trump administration is in place, and they&apos;re faced with the reality of owning the situation and the implications, then perhaps that will moderate some of the language that comes from the incoming administration. The Kyiv Independent: And how important is it that Ukraine retains some territory in Kursk Oblast by the time that Trump comes into office? Because if Trump does try to impose a freeze of the front lines, obviously Ukrainian troops on Russian soil greatly complicates things for the Kremlin. Ben Hodges: This was one of the reasons I have been a supporter of the Ukrainian decision to launch the Kursk counteroffensive because it does create a real problem for the Kremlin. Both in terms of whether or not to commit forces to try and eliminate this bridgehead and in terms of some sort of negotiations coming up. So, it does create a problem, and I think this was a brilliant move by the Ukrainian General Staff. Now, at the end of the day, the Ukrainian General Staff will have to decide if it is worth it. Are they getting the benefit of this versus the casualties and the costs of hanging onto it? We&apos;ll see. They will know much better than I ever will. But again, Trump cannot impose a freeze on this conflict. There are no American soldiers there. Europe is providing more aid combined than the United States is. So I think the idea that somehow Trump can impose a freeze or impose a ceasefire, that&apos;s just not what&apos;s going to happen. He can, of course, demand it. He can, of course, stop all aid. But I think that people with cooler heads will understand that it&apos;s in our interest that Europe remains stable, secure, and prosperous for our own economic reasons. And China is watching to see how we handle this. The Kyiv Independent: What sort of leverage will Trump have over Putin to try to get him to stop? Obviously, in Donbas, the Russian offensive is still relatively slow, but it&apos;s gaining pace. So Putin does have the upper hand there. So what kind of thing can Trump do to try and force Putin into a deal? Ben Hodges: There are so many things that we have not done yet. We have not imposed all the sanctions that could have been imposed. We have not taken steps to block Russia from exporting oil and gas to China and India, which is what generates the money necessary for Russia to be able to buy ammunition and weapons from Iran and North Korea. We&apos;ve done nothing against those things. So there are still economic tools remaining for the incoming administration. And, of course, he could say, &apos;I&apos;m going to accelerate delivery of ATACMs,&apos; for example, or other capabilities. So, the incoming president has a lot of leverage to build on what the Biden administration has already done, which has fallen well short of what I think could have been done. So, Trump will have a lot of leverage against Putin. Does he want to use that? That&apos;s what remains to be seen. The Kyiv Independent: You mentioned China just before. What do you think China is hoping to see when Trump takes office? Ben Hodges: I think the Chinese are waiting to see if the U.S. and our allies have the political will to actually defend these post-war constructs of respect for sovereignty, freedom of navigation, respect for international law, respect for international agreements. If we&apos;re not willing to do that in Europe, they may think we&apos;re not willing to do that out in the Indo-Pacific region, where, frankly, it will be much more difficult to do &#x2014; it takes nine days for a U.S. Navy ship to go all the way from Hawaii to Japan, for example. I think the Chinese are going to be watching that. They&apos;ll be watching to see if Trump follows through on the threat to impose these massive tariffs that will have a significant impact. I think, like everyone, they want to know how much of what was said in the campaign is actually going to happen in reality. The Kyiv Independent: Earlier on, you alluded to the differences in how particularly Eastern European states perceive the Russian threat and how America perceives the Russian threat. How do you think that&apos;s going to play out with an increasingly isolationist U.S.? Is Europe going to be able to fill that gap if aid slows or if they reduce support in other ways? Ben Hodges: Well, they certainly can. The combined economies of the European Union &#x2014; forget Canada and the U.K. &#x2014; the combined economies of the European Union are about eight times greater than Russia. So this is about political will. It&apos;s not about economic capacity or industrial capacity. It&apos;s about political will. And so what I would hope is that Europe, led by a new German government coming in February, probably led by Friedrich Merz and the CDU, Poland under Donald Tusk, Finland under Alexander Stubb, and Italy under Prime Minister Meloni, that together they could convince the American president &apos;hey, don&apos;t turn your back on Europe.&apos; We still need an American nuclear deterrent. But we, Europe, can pick up the slack if the U.S. needs to back away from its support for Ukraine. There&apos;s a lot of potential in Europe. The question is, do they have the political will? The Kyiv Independent: And just to finish with, how do you personally feel about the future for Ukraine? Ben Hodges: I&apos;ve always believed in the eventual victory of Ukraine, not because I want it to be so, but because I have seen what Ukraine has been able to accomplish over the last 11 years, that they have stopped Russia without consistent, decisive aid from the U.S. or from Europe. I mean, this war started in 2014. So all the people talking about how today is 1,000 days &#x2014; that&apos;s only 1,000 days since the large-scale invasion. It&apos;s been almost 7,000 days since Russia first invaded Ukraine. And after 11 years, almost 7,000 days, Russia still only controls about 20% of Ukraine, and they have suffered devastating losses. Russian industry is in tatters. And so I think it&apos;s clear to me that there&apos;s no way Russia can just knock Ukraine out of the war unless we in the West quit. So this sort of resilience and determination by Ukrainian soldiers and people, emergency services, is something that we&apos;re all going to be studying and admiring for a very long time.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-only-wins-if-the-west-quits-gen-ben-hodges/	2024-11-20T11:56:20-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2175488443.jpg
Court jails Russian actor in absentia, confiscates his Odesa apartment	A Ukrainian court has sentenced Russian actor Vladimir Mashkov to 10 years in prison in absentia and ordered the confiscation of his apartment in Odesa, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on its Telegram channel on Nov. 20. Mashkov, who was convicted for war propaganda and for encouraging the violation of Ukraine&#x2019;s territorial integrity, owned a 147 square meter apartment on the seacoast in Odesa. He has performed in various Russian pro-war events and is a vocal supporter of President Vladimir Putin and Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. He was also a co-chairman of Putin&apos;s election headquarters during Russia&apos;s 2024 presidential election. &#x201C;As head of a leading theater, he used theatrical and media resources to propagate the Kremlin&apos;s ideology to a large audience,&#x201D; Ukraine&#x2019;s Prosecutor General&apos;s Office wrote on Telegram. Mashkov, who currently resides in Russia, did not appear at the court.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-court-sentences-russian-actor-vladimir-mashkov-to-10-years-of-prison-and-confiscation-of-apartment-in-absentia/	2024-11-20T11:21:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------_-------_2019-1.jpg
Delayed by war, Ukraine’s long-awaited 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2' surges to the top of video game purchases	More than two years after Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion delayed its release and upended its developers&#x2019; lives, Ukraine&#x2019;s &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&quot; &#x2014; one of the most anticipated video games of the year &#x2014; was released on Nov. 20. Employees of GSC Game World, the Ukrainian company behind its creation, completed the game while navigating blackouts, missile strikes, scattered employees, and the challenge of restarting operations from a new office in Prague. Originally set for a release in April 2022, the game experienced several delays when many of its staff were forced to flee Ukraine that February. Ahead of the release this week, presales of the game took it to the top spot for games sold on the popular video game platform Steam. Like the 2007 original in the series, which has been played by millions, &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&quot;: Heart of Chornobyl is a first-person immersive shooter game set in a fictionalized version of Chornobyl&apos;s exclusion zone after an apocalyptic nuclear disaster. The war affected more than just the timing of the game&apos;s release. After the full-scale invasion, the game&apos;s name was changed to use the Ukrainian spelling of Chornobyl, instead of the Russian version, &quot;Chernobyl.&quot; GSC Game World also removed Russian voiceovers and has refused to sell the game in Russia. The game developers have spoken about facing Russian threats and frequent hacking attempts because of their decisions. In a documentary about the game&#x2019;s creation released in October, Anton Kukhtytskyi, the game&#x2019;s lead concept artist, described his first weeks of the full-scale war. For two weeks, he had no electricity, internet, or connection outside his village. He had no idea if the rest of his family had survived. &quot;Sitting in that cellar with my wife and my cats, I felt like I was abandoned. But like a &apos;stalker,&apos; you have to learn how to live in such situation,&quot; Kukhtytskyi said. &quot;I switched to drawing on paper, so I didn&#x2019;t stop developing.&quot; After many of the staff relocated to Prague, they had to completely recast their voice-actors, since many had gone to fight, relocated, or fallen out of communication. Additionally, the staff had fled without their equipment and had to build new motion capture and audio recording studios from scratch, according to the film. &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2,&quot; released on Nov. 20, is set in a fictionalized exclusion zone of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. (GSC Game World)A significant portion of the staff still remains in Ukraine. Because of the developers&apos; vocal support for Ukrainian armed forces and the content of the game, a Russian official suggested this month that purchases of the game in Russia could be criminalized after its release. (While GSC Game World products are not officially available in Russia, users have reported workarounds online.) Prior to the full-scale invasion, Ukraine was home to hundreds of video game companies and an estimated tens of thousands of Ukrainian video game developers. GSC Game World was founded in Kyiv in 1995 and is one of the oldest and most prominent video game developers in the country. In addition to &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.,&quot; the company is known for its &quot;Cossacks&quot; strategy game franchise. Since 2020, the company is co-owned by Maksym Krippa, a wealthy Ukrainian businessman who has kept a low profile and mostly avoided public attention. Krippa&apos;s career is reportedly connected with casinos and gambling businesses, though GSC Game World distanced itself from his former activities, stating his portfolio no longer holds gambling companies. In the past several years, Krippa has built up significant stakes in online gaming and real estate, including the 2018 purchase of Ukraine&apos;s major e-sports league NAVI and a subsequent deal to become co-owner of Maincast, an e-sports broadcasting studio. &#xA0; He made headlines recently with real estate purchases of the Parus business center in Kyiv last year, which Forbes Ukraine dubbed &quot;the largest deal since the start of the full-scale war,&quot; and purchases of major hotels in downtown Kyiv.

UN World Food Program allocates $2.1 billion to Ukraine until 2027	The U.N.&#x2019;s World Food Program has allocated $2.1 billion for Ukraine between 2025 and 2027, Ukraine&#x2019;s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Telegram on Nov. 20. &#x201C;The plan provides for humanitarian assistance, support for civilians, continuation of the demining process and support for Ukraine&apos;s export potential in supplying agricultural products to international markets,&#x201D; he said. According to a U.N. estimate, Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine has caused $80 billion worth of damage to its agricultural sector. Before the war, Ukraine&#x2019;s agricultural output could feed 400 million people worldwide. Russia&#x2019;s invasion, however, disrupted supply chains and trade routes, driving up food prices globally.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-world-food-program-allocates-2-1-billion-to-ukraine-until-2027/	2024-11-20T10:14:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2173387817.jpg
US announces $275 million military aid package for Ukraine	The United States will send a new military package worth $275 million to Ukraine, the Pentagon said in a statement on Nov. 20. It will include HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) ammunition, artillery shells, and Javelin surface-to-air missiles, in addition to a wide range of spare parts and equipment. &#x201C;The United States will continue to work together with some 50 Allies and partners to meet Ukraine&apos;s urgently needed battlefield requirements and defend against Russian aggression,&#x201D; the statement read. Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s administration has supported Ukraine with $60 billion in military aid. However, the future of the U.S. commitment to providing arms to Ukraine remains uncertain as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January 2025. Trump has promised a quick end to the war, but did not elaborate on how he intends to achieve this. A likely scenario is using the suspension of aid as a tool to force Ukraine into negotiations with Russia. Since his rival&#x2019;s election victory, Biden has vowed to provide Ukraine with additional aid &#x201C;to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position,&#x201D; according to the Pentagon&#x2019;s statement. Biden has also authorized the delivery of anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine, his Secretary of Defense Austin Loyd told reporters on Nov. 20 in Laos. The decision is expected to help slow down Russia&apos;s advance in the east of the country. The move follows the Biden administration&apos;s authorization of the use of U.S.-made long-range missiles to strike Russian territory. Kyiv has not officially confirmed the claims, but recent reports indicate Ukraine struck targets in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast with ATACMS missiles.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-announces-275-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-11-20T08:50:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russia with Storm Shadows for the first time, Bloomberg reports	Ukraine has struck targets inside Russia with British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles for the first time, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 20, citing a Western official familiar with the matter. According to the source, the strikes were approved as a response to the presence of North Korean troops in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, a sign of escalation by Russia. Different versions of Storm Shadow missiles have a range of between 250 and 560 kilometers. Storm Shadows have been used to hit Russian military targets in Crimea, a sovereign Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia. The reported strikes come a day after Ukraine reportedly used U.S.-made ATACMS long-range missiles to attack Russian territory, following outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s approval on Nov. 17. That strike reportedly hit a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russia-with-storm-shadows-for-the-first-time-bloomberg-reports/	2024-11-20T07:35:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2163689551.jpg
ATACMS boost for Ukraine as Trump inauguration looms	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 19 that Ukraine had launched the U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast. Hours prior, Ukraine struck a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast, a two-hour drive from the Ukrainian-controlled part of Russia. President Joe Biden&apos;s decision to finally allow Ukraine to use ATACMS against Russian and North Korean forces comes with a looming deadline &#x2014; the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. The new president is widely expected to lead a dramatic shift in U.S. policy towards the war, focused on attempts to get Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate. Both sides will be looking to enter any possible talks in the most favorable position possible, with territory in Kursk Oblast potentially being some of the most politically valuable of all. &quot;Many of our fellow citizens will be hurt by these words, but the defense of Kursk Oblast is a higher priority than the Kurakhiv bridgehead, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts,&quot; Dmytro Zhmailo, a military expert and executive director of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, told the Kyiv Independent. The ability to finally use the long-range missiles to attack military facilities in Kursk Oblast and its surroundings is expected to give Ukraine a better chance to hold on to the Russian territories that are said to be the last major ace in Kyiv&apos;s rather unfavorable hand. The Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is a U.S.-made, short-range, supersonic ballistic missile. The ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers, can be equipped with either high explosive or cluster munition warheads, and are fired from U.S.-made 142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). They&apos;re not new to the war in Ukraine &#x2014; in the fall of 2023, the U.S. began supplying Kyiv with an older model of ATACMS with a range of around 165 kilometers. In the spring of 2024, the New York Times (NYT) reported that the U.S. had shipped around 100 updated versions of ATACMS missiles, which can reach up to 300 kilometers. Ukraine has put both variants into effect on the battlefield, striking targets in occupied Crimea and other parts of Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.

(South Korean Defense Ministry via Getty Images)How could ATACMS help in Kursk?After Ukraine launched its incursion into Kursk Oblast, Kyiv said one of the main aims of the operation was to prevent Moscow from sending additional reinforcements to the front in Ukraine&apos;s east. Yet, Russia&apos;s grinding advances in Donetsk Oblast have only gained pace in the months since, with large chunks of Ukrainian territory, sometimes including entire towns, lost on a near-daily basis in southern Donetsk Oblast. Without diverting troops from eastern Ukraine, Russia has been able to assemble a force of nearly 50,000 troops in Kursk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 11, including more than 10,000 soldiers from North Korea. Militarily, this particular aim in Kursk Oblast has failed, but Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. presidential election has dramatically changed the calculus. The president-elect has long promised to bring a swift end to the war in Ukraine, and although he has not elaborated on his plans, it&apos;s been widely reported that it will involve a freezing of the front lines shortly after he takes office.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)According to experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine&apos;s territory in Kursk has now soared in political value and would be a strong bargaining chip in any negotiations. &quot;Moscow wants to go into any negotiations with the dominant narrative that Ukraine is getting progressively weaker and less able to sustain the war, with allies that are growing tired of supporting Kyiv, whereas Moscow can keep up this level of effort forever,&quot; Jenny Mathers, senior lecturer in international politics at Aberystwyth University, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Anything that raises questions about that narrative, such as a newly empowered Ukrainian force in Russia, or the easing of restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s use of Western weapons, or greater energy and enthusiasm for the fight on the side of Ukraine&apos;s allies, is a danger to Russia&apos;s position.&quot; If Ukraine can hold on until Trump takes office, it could make the idea of Russian President Vladimir Putin agreeing to any proposal to freeze the war unfeasible, as freezing the war with a front line inside Russia would likely be a non-starter for the Kremlin. &quot;Our presence in Russia negates its power,&quot; Zhmailo said. &quot;It also strengthens our negotiating position, and offsets the principle of the Russians, various peace doves, the Chinese-Brazilian initiative, and the African initiative to freeze the actual front line. &quot;That is why the Russians have become so active now.&quot; But this all relies on one thing &#x2014; Ukraine being able to hold on to territory in Kursk Oblast, and fend off the 50,000-strong force now assembled to assault Kyiv&apos;s positions. According to John Foreman CBE, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, the decision to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS against Russian and North Korean forces in Kursk Oblast is at least in part an effort to help Kyiv hold on to as much territory as possible before Trump takes office and tries to freeze the front lines. &quot;Plus a reaction to North Korea sending troops and Russia pummeling Ukrainian cities,&quot; he added. &quot;Like with any weapon introduced it will not win the war by itself,&quot; Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;But it will make it more difficult for the Russians to command their troops effectively and supply them adequately from even further afar.&quot; Bruchmann points to the effect U.S.-supplied HIMARS had in Ukraine when they first arrived in the summer of 2022, compelling Russian forces to move command centers and logistical nodes out of their 80-kilometer range after a series of devastating Ukrainian strikes. &quot;It will make it more difficult for the Russians to command their troops effectively, and supply them adequately from even further afar,&quot; Bruchmann said. &quot;For example, Russian transport hubs such as train junctions that feed the front lines in Kursk or Belgorod are now more vulnerable.&quot; Ukrainian reported an attack against a Russian arsenal in Karachev&#x431; overnight on Nov. 19, reportedly &#x435;&#x444;&#x43A;&#x43F;&#x443;&#x435;&#x443;&#x432; stored artillery ammunition, including North Korean munitions, KAB guided bombs, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launcher ammunition. Retired U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges agreed with Burchman, saying while strikes like this won&apos;t be a &quot;game changer,&quot; it is nonetheless &quot;still a positive step.&quot; &quot;I would anticipate that the Ukrainian General Staff will use these to target Russian headquarters, logistics, and artillery,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;That&apos;s how you defeat mass and mass is the only advantage that the Russian forces have, the big numbers.&quot; On the ground in Kursk Oblast, the political machinations of Biden&apos;s ATACMS decision prompted more questions than answers from at least one soldier. &quot;I look at it all, and it&apos;s all a big show to me,&quot; Dmytro, a medic with Ukraine 61st Mechanized Brigade who has been stationed in Kursk Oblast since the start of the incursion, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Why didn&apos;t they give it earlier? Why did we take so long? Because it was simply profitable for someone to drag it all out, that&apos;s all. That is, human life is not valued, human resources are not valued, but something else is valued.&quot; A Ukrainian drone Unit commander with the call sign Boxer (right) stands in front of Ukrainian vehicles parked at a Ukrainian military position and former Russian military position in the Ukrainian-controlled territory of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast, Russia, on Aug. 18, 2024. (Ed Ram/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)What is Kyiv saying?Officially, holding territory in Kursk Oblast is not about holding a bargaining chip in future negotiations but defending Ukraine&apos;s Sumy Oblast from attacks, Ukrainian lawmaker and the chair of the parliament&apos;s foreign affairs policy Oleksandr Merezhko told the Kyiv Independent. But he added that as well as having a military purpose, it does hold political weight in the context of peace talks. &quot;It might help to force Putin to negotiate in earnest,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;Because holding this territory shows the weakness of Putin, his inability to guarantee security within the country.&quot; While it may not be the official position, Zelensky has alluded to the bargaining power of holding territory in Kursk Oblast, saying on Sept. 4 that the &quot;same attitude&quot; was applied to trading captured territories as trading captured prisoners of war (POWs). And the mood music in Kyiv has shifted dramatically since the Nov. 5 election, with Zelensky saying on Nov. 16 that the war will &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration, adding that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means. &quot;There is a tendency to see Trump&apos;s election and looming presidency as nothing but bad news for Ukraine, but the sense that this stage of the war is coming to some kind of a resolution may have created some urgency and pace that may work in Ukraine&apos;s favor,&quot; Mathers said. &quot;Without the sense of the ticking clock produced by Trump&apos;s approaching inauguration, there is the risk that Ukraine&apos;s territorial gains in Russia could have just dwindled to little or nothing, gradually over time. &quot;So, by creating a new momentum, I think Trump has affected events quite a lot.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/atacms-boost-for-ukraine-as-trump-inauguration-looms/	2024-11-20T06:58:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182505497.jpg
Parliament adopts bill to strip individuals supporting Russia of state awards	Ukraine&#x2019;s parliament adopted a law on Nov. 20 allowing the deprivation of state awards from individuals who &quot;popularize or propagandize&quot; Russia or commit other illegal actions against the Ukrainian state. The law, supported by 283 lawmakers, was introduced as a presidential bill and enables the National Security and Defense Council to revoke state awards through sanctions enacted by a presidential decree, according to Ukrainian MP Pavlo Frolov. European Solidarity MP Iryna Herashchenko explained that the law amends the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and other legislation to target individuals convicted of serious crimes, actions against Ukraine&#x2019;s national security, or the promotion and justification of Russia&apos;s occupation of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky initiated the draft law on July 16, aiming to address cases where state honors were awarded to individuals later found supporting Russia or violating Ukrainian laws. In 2022, a petition to strip pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker Yurii Boyko of the Hero of Ukraine title surpassed the threshold for presidential review. However, the process stalled, highlighting the need for a formal legal mechanism to revoke state honors.	https://kyivindependent.com/state-awards/	2024-11-20T06:26:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2167201231.jpg
Latest strikes on Ukraine’s electricity substations threaten ‘power failure,' Greenpeace warns	Greenpeace has warned that Ukraine&#x2019;s power grid faces a &quot;heightened risk of catastrophic failure&quot; after a mass missile and drone attack on Nov. 17 targeted electrical substations essential for nuclear power plants, the Guardian reported on Nov. 20. The strikes highlight Russia&#x2019;s strategy to weaken Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, intensifying the strain on the country&#x2019;s nuclear power plants, which supply two-thirds of its electricity. Experts warn that disrupting power to these facilities could lead to severe safety risks. The recent Russian strikes targeted substations vital for the operation of the three remaining Ukraine-run nuclear power plants: Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, and South Ukraine. While the reactors were not directly hit, Greenpeace claims that the damage to substations could destabilize the grid, increasing the likelihood of dangerous shutdowns at the nuclear sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that trunk power lines connecting the substations to the nuclear plants were severed, with explosions reported near the Khmelnytskyi plant. As a result, six of nine reactors were operating at reduced capacity by Nov. 17. Russia launched around 210 missiles and drones during the attack, Ukrenergo said, causing &#x201C;serious damage&#x201D; to thermal power plants and triggering nationwide electricity rationing. Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy company, DTEK, called the assault one of the most destructive to date. Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system has been repeatedly targeted since the start of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war. Earlier strikes devastated coal, oil, and hydroelectric power plants, making the remaining nuclear facilities critical to the country&#x2019;s electricity supply. Greenpeace&#x2019;s analysis, which aligns with assessments from Ukrainian authorities, underscores the urgency of securing these vital energy resources.	https://kyivindependent.com/latest-strikes-on-ukraines-electricity-substations-threaten-power-failure-greenpeace-warns/	2024-11-20T06:13:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239680001.jpg
Opinion: Europe’s 2% defense benchmark is an illusion, not a solution	With Donald Trump back in office, Europe faces a new era of uncertainty. The once-reliable comfort of American support &#x2014; a cornerstone of European security &#x2014; is now more in question than ever. For decades, Europe has assumed the U.S. would always be there to pick up the slack. But those days are over. Trump&apos;s administration openly questions NATO&#x2019;s role and views American involvement in European security with skepticism. Europe must now confront a new reality: it can no longer sit back, assuming the U.S. will handle its defense. Now is the time to act. Some in Europe may feel isolated in the challenge of supporting Ukraine, but this view underestimates Europe&#x2019;s own strength. The European Union is the world&#x2019;s largest trading bloc, one of the top three global economies, and home to four of the 10 largest economies on the planet. Russia, by comparison, ranks as the world&#x2019;s 11th largest economy &#x2014; its size comparable to Italy, with Spain not far behind. Europe&#x2019;s challenge is not a lack of resources, but the will to use them. Supporting Ukraine is not a cost; it&#x2019;s an investment in Europe&#x2019;s security and stability. The 2% GDP goal for NATO members was once a practical way to measure commitment to the alliance. But today, with threats evolving and new challenges emerging, that target is outdated. True security isn&#x2019;t about budget percentages; it&#x2019;s about capabilities &#x2014; about building a Europe that can defend itself and respond swiftly to crises. Russia&#x2019;s brutal assault on Ukraine has shown us that a spending target doesn&#x2019;t protect us &#x2014; actionable resources, modern defense systems, and readiness to act do. Europe has already seen this firsthand. Financial pledges to Ukraine are important, but on the ground, specific resources like anti-air systems, secure communications, and logistical support have made the difference. Europe now faces this same reality: leaders must move beyond symbolic spending goals and prioritize real capabilities to meet today&#x2019;s urgent security needs.

(Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images)Trump&#x2019;s return to office is Europe&#x2019;s wake-up call. The idea of &#x201C;strategic autonomy&#x201D; has circulated in policy circles for years, but Europe can no longer afford to keep it theoretical. Europe already has what it takes. It boasts a tier-one defense industry with advanced R&amp;D that rivals the capabilities of the U.S., China, and Russia. The talent, resources, and infrastructure are all in place. With the right focus, Europe&#x2019;s defense industry can deliver the advanced technologies and autonomous capabilities required to protect the continent. If Europe accelerates its initiatives, strategic autonomy can shift from a policy concept to a concrete reality. Ukraine&#x2019;s resistance to Russian aggression makes Europe&#x2019;s role in its defense indispensable, especially as American support becomes uncertain. Ukraine is not only defending its sovereignty but also the stability of Europe. This moment tests Europe&#x2019;s resolve &#x2014; not just in its support for Ukraine, but in its commitment to its own values and regional stability. Europe must act independently. The stakes are high: a retreat would hand Putin a critical advantage in his obsessive quest to redraw borders by force. The implications extend beyond Ukraine. With Trump&#x2019;s administration setting new precedents, other authoritarian states may be emboldened to challenge Europe. China, Iran, and others may interpret diminished U.S. involvement as an invitation to advance their interests in ways that threaten European stability. Europe&#x2019;s leaders must confront these growing risks, prepared to act decisively with or without U.S. backing. The lesson from Ukraine is stark: alliances are powerful, but self-reliance is essential for survival. Europe&#x2019;s defense future cannot be outsourced. This is a test of political will and unity. As Europe faces its greatest threat in a generation, it&#x2019;s time to rise to the occasion. The era of dependency is over &#x2014; our sovereignty demands it, our future depends on it. Europe has the talent, the resources, and the drive to make this vision a reality. The time has come for European leaders to adopt a security strategy that reflects the gravity of the moment. This isn&#x2019;t just about adapting to an unpredictable U.S. stance; it&#x2019;s about establishing a Europe that can defend itself, stand with Ukraine, and lead in a world of shifting alliances. Security isn&#x2019;t a budget line item; it&#x2019;s the bedrock of our shared European future and a free Ukraine. It&#x2019;s time to make it a priority.

Parliament backs bill to dissolve medical commissions in 1st reading after corruption scandals	The Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, supported a draft law on the elimination of the system of medical examination commissions (MSEC) for determining the severity of disabilities in the first reading on Nov. 20. President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a decree in October to liquidate the commissions in the wake of accusations of Ukrainian officials using corrupt schemes to acquire falsified disability certifications. A total of 260 members of parliament voted in favor of the bill, said Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of the Holos party. Obtaining disability status through medical examination commissions allows one to avoid military service and receive a higher pension, among other social benefits. The draft law&apos;s authors proposed replacing the system of medical examination commissions with &quot;an assessment of a person&apos;s daily functioning.&quot; &quot;The system of medical and social expertise that currently exists in Ukraine was formed before Ukraine gained independence. It does not meet the current challenges that our country faces during the armed aggression by the Russian Federation, nor the current approaches to establishing disability adopted in the world,&quot; the explanatory note to the draft law read. The draft law&apos;s authors expect that the new system will help create a transparent procedure for assessing the needs of the applicants. The replacement of commissions is expected to reduce the administrative burden and help reduce appeals against their decisions. Following the National Security and Defense Council meeting on Oct. 22, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said that the SBU had exposed corruption schemes at medical examination commissions in 2024, resulting in the cancellation of 4,106 fake disability status certificates. Maliuk added that 64 officials at medical examination commissions have been charged with committing crimes, while another nine suspects have been convicted. According to Zelensky&apos;s October decree, all commissions in Ukraine are to be eliminated by Dec. 31, 2024. Ukraine&apos;s Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin submitted his resignation on Oct. 22 following the reports of prosecutors illegally obtaining disability status.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-bill-to-eliminate-medical-commissions/	2024-11-20T06:00:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2170188731.jpg
Russia's FSB detains German citizen over alleged 'terrorist plot'	Russia&#x2019;s Federal Security Service (FSB) announced on Nov. 20 the detention of German citizen Nikolai Gaiduk, accusing him of planning terrorist attacks on energy infrastructure in the Kaliningrad region. Russia accused Gaiduk, a resident of Hamburg, Germany, of orchestrating the March 2024 bombing of a low-pressure gas distribution station in Kaliningrad using an improvised explosive device. The Kaliningrad region is Russia&apos;s heavily-armed exclave at the Baltic Sea coast, lodged between NATO members Poland and Lithuania. The FSB claims Gaiduk was detained after entering the Kaliningrad region from Poland, allegedly to conduct further sabotage. A search of his vehicle reportedly uncovered 0.5 liters of liquid explosive material. According to the FSB, Gaiduk received instructions and materials from Alexander (Oleksandr) Zhorov, a Ukrainian citizen residing in Hamburg. A criminal case has been opened against Gaiduk on terrorism and explosives smuggling charges. The independent Russian news outlet Agentstvo identified Gaiduk as a 57-year-old native of Ukraine who had lived in Konotop in Sumy Oblast before moving to Germany. The German Foreign Ministry said it is keeping itself informed but declined to comment on the allegations. The FSB announced on Nov. 19 the detention of two residents of Russian-occupied Crimea, accused of involvement in a Nov. 13 car bombing in Sevastopol that killed Russian Navy officer Valery Trankovsky.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-fsb-detains-german-citizen-over-alleged-terrorist-plot/	2024-11-20T05:45:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1249616715--1-.jpg
Germany delivers new military aid to Ukraine, including howitzers, Gepards	Germany has delivered fresh military aid to Ukraine, including four self-propelled Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers, three Gepard anti-aircraft guns, and more, the German government said on Nov. 20. Initially criticized for its sluggish delivery of military aid to Ukraine following the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Berlin has become the second-largest provider of military equipment after the U.S. Germany has handed over ammunition for infantry fighting vehicles Marder, 41,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition, and several reconnaissance drones, including Vector, Hornet XR, Golden Eagle, VT-4 Rochen, Songbird, and others. Ukraine received medical equipment, 47 mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles (MRAP), seven howitzer tubes M109 155 mm, three mine clearing tanks Wisent 1, two bridge-laying tanks Beaver, as well as eight air assault vehicles Caracal. The tranche also included 340 precision rifles HLR 338 with 74,000 rounds of ammunition, 8,000 rounds of 40 mm ammunition, and 100,000 rounds of ammunition for firearms from Bundeswehr and industry stocks. According to an agreed-upon federal budget, Germany&apos;s military aid to Ukraine will be cut by half next year when compared to 2024. Berlin has allocated around 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) to Kyiv in 2024, whereas the next year&apos;s support is currently set at 4 billion euros ($4.35 billion). Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in turn, is not planning to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles despite the U.S. easing restrictions on long-range strikes. Berlin&apos;s policy may soon shift as Germany heads toward snap elections on Feb. 23, with the center-right opposition alliance CDU/CSU currently leading the polls and threatening to oust Scholz.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-military-aid/	2024-11-20T05:25:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1258715984.jpg
Russian officials threaten US over long-range strikes, allude to nuclear doctrine changes	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Nov. 19 that Moscow &quot;will respond accordingly&quot; to Washington&apos;s permission for Ukraine to strike Russian soil with U.S. weapons. Speaking at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Lavrov referred to Russia&#x2019;s updated nuclear doctrine, which permits nuclear retaliation for attacks by non-nuclear states supported by nuclear powers. When asked during the summit if the U.S. had authorized Ukraine to use long-range weapons to target Russia, Lavrov responded, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know whether it&#x2019;s true or not. We are focused on ensuring our security.&quot; &quot;We have already stated everything necessary to those considering this, officially. The president said it, and now it&#x2019;s confirmed in an official document,&quot; he said, according to TASS. On Nov. 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved an updated nuclear deterrence policy that expands the conditions for a nuclear strike. The revised doctrine outlines scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike, suggesting that this could include &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks. The alleged use of U.S. ATACMS missiles by Ukraine to strike Russia&#x2019;s Bryansk Oblast was reportedly the catalyst for Lavrov&apos;s remarks. &#xA0; Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia&apos;s Security Council known for his provocative and often extreme outbursts, also weighed in, threatening to use weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine and NATO. According to the official, the updated doctrine could qualify Ukraine&apos;s use of NATO-supplied missiles in Russia as a trigger for &quot;a mass retaliatory strike with weapons of mass destruction on Kyiv and main NATO facilities.&quot; &quot;This is already World War III,&quot; Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel. Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock dismissed the Kremlin&apos;s blackmail, calling them a tactic to exploit the West&#x2019;s fears. The Pentagon stated there are no indications of Russia preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine despite its revised nuclear doctrine. Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh called Russia&apos;s rhetoric &quot;irresponsible&quot; and consistent with its behavior over the past two years.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-officials-threaten-us-over-long-range-strikes-allude-to-nuclear-doctrine-changes/	2024-11-20T05:14:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/04/GettyImages-1485172048.jpg
Russia strikes humanitarian aid distribution point in Kherson Oblast	Russian forces struck a humanitarian aid distribution point in Novodmytrivka, Kherson Oblast, on Nov. 20, the Kherson Regional Military Administration reported. The attack targeted a building where volunteers were distributing bread to residents, officials said. A projectile struck the roof, damaging windows, the facade, and the roof itself. No injuries were reported. A Russian drone also attempted to attack the volunteers&apos; vehicle, with the aircraft striking near the car, the administration said. Novodmytrivka lies in the Ukraine-held part of Kherson Oblast, less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the regional center, Kherson. Across Ukraine, Russian attacks over the past day killed at least two people and injured 30, according to local authorities. In Kherson Oblast, 21 settlements, including the regional center of Kherson, came under fire. The attacks killed two people and injured 15 others, the military administration reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-strikes-humanitarian-aid-distribution-point-in-kherson-oblast/	2024-11-20T04:23:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/466747406_960061486155681_8414494342139342985_n.jpg
Russian forces attack 10 times per day as they push toward Kurakhove, military says	The Russian military conducts up to 10 assaults daily in an attempt to approach the town of Kurakhove in Donetsk Oblast, Oleksandr Nevidomyi, spokesperson of the 46th Airmobile Brigade, told Suspilne on Nov. 20. Russia is carrying out intense attacks in multiple sections of the eastern front, with attempts to break through Ukraine&apos;s defenses in Donetsk Oblast toward the towns of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk. &quot;Every day, there can be up to 10 assaults, both by infantry groups and armored vehicles. There are also attempts to cross the river (Vovcha) on rubber boats,&quot; Nevidomyi said. The Ukrainian serviceman added that Russian forces are actively using kamikaze drones, particularly to drop ammunition from a height. The estimated Russian advance near Kurakhove, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Nov. 19, 2024, according to the DeepState monitoring group. (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)According to Nevidomyi, the Russian military is based north of Kurakhove at a high altitude, from where they launch drones to attack Ukrainian positions and logistics. &quot;And, of course, Russian artillery does not stop working,&quot; he added. &quot;They (the Russian military) are recovering. They are getting new troops who are training at the training ground. They have no problems with people, they have a lot of them.&quot; Russian forces damaged the dam holding the Kurakhove Reservoir in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 11, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Russian forces also claimed to have taken the front-line village of Novoselydivka, which lies some 7 kilometers (4 miles) north of Kurakhove, on Nov. 19. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. The Russian advance in Ukraine&apos;s east has picked up a long-unseen pace in the past few months, with outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian defenders steadily forced to retreat. The U.S. election victory of Donald Trump adds to the uncertainties, casting a shadow on Ukraine&apos;s ability to hold back Russian forces.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-forces-conduct-up-to-10-assaults-daily-near-kurakhove-military-says/	2024-11-20T04:12:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158420470.jpg
Carmaker forecasts 30% collapse in Russian car market by 2025	Sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles in Russia could decline by 21-30% in 2025 if high interest rates persist, Avtovaz CEO Maxim Sokolov said on Nov. 19, according to the state-owned TASS news agency. Sokolov attributed the anticipated decline to customers diverting savings from car purchases to bank deposits due to elevated interest rates. Russia&apos;s central bank raised its key interest rate to 21% in October, its highest level since 2003, aiming to curb inflation caused by massive wartime spending to meet its 2026 target. &quot;This will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the market and production plans in the medium term,&quot; he said, warning that Avtovaz&#x2019;s current production levels will not be sustainable under such economic conditions. The state-owned Avtovaz is Russia&apos;s largest carmaker, best known for its flagship Lada vehicle series. The high rates are not only affecting the automotive sector but also threatening Russia&#x2019;s broader economy. Izvestia reported on Nov. 13 that about 30 Russian airlines, responsible for 26% of domestic passenger traffic, are at risk of bankruptcy in 2025 due to economic pressures.	https://kyivindependent.com/carmaker-forecasts-30-collapse-in-russian-car-market-by-2025/	2024-11-20T03:24:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-454250652.jpg
Parliament passes bills on military service, including draft deferral for civilians released from captivity	The Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed several bills on Nov. 20 changing the mobilization rules for some of the citizens who had suffered due to Russian aggression. Ukrainian authorities have been revising the legal framework for military service to make mobilization processes more equitable as the grueling war continues for almost three years. The Verkhovna Rada passed bills that grant the right to defer mobilization to civilians who have been released from Russian captivity, as well as the right to discharge from service to those military personnel whose step-family members were killed or went missing in the war. The key change is that military personnel are now granted the right to be released from service after the death or disappearance of their half-siblings. The parliament also passed a draft law to clarify rules for a draft deferral to people whose close relatives were killed or went missing while participating in hostilities. The purpose of the bill is to eliminate &quot;legal uncertainty&quot; regarding the grounds for granting a deferral from military service during mobilization to women and men whose close relatives were killed or went missing during the war. The draft law proposes that women and men whose close relatives were killed or went missing under &quot;special circumstances&quot; or during hostilities provoked by Russian aggression could receive a deferral. Earlier, secretary of the parliamentary defense committee Roman Kostenko said the Defense Ministry planned to finalize the bill defining the procedure and conditions for discharging military personnel from service by Dec. 18 this year. Ukraine&apos;s parliament adopted an updated mobilization law in mid-April to ramp up mobilization amid Russia&apos;s ongoing war. The new law simplifies the process for identifying eligible conscripts and includes additional penalties for those dodging the draft. The parliament voted to remove provisions on demobilization, which previously foresaw soldiers having the right to leave the military after 36 months of service, from the bill so that they could be considered separately. The parliament obliged the Defense Ministry to develop a relevant draft law within eight months.	https://kyivindependent.com/parliament-bills-military-service/	2024-11-20T03:12:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178721575.jpg
Sweden investigating Chinese ship's possible role in Baltic Sea cable damage, FT reports	Swedish authorities are investigating damage to two communication cables in the Baltic Sea and whether the Chinese cargo ship Yi Peng 3 may have been involved, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 20, citing undisclosed sources. Data from maritime tracking group MarineTraffic shows the Yi Peng 3, traveling from Russia to Egypt, passed near the Swedish-Lithuanian and Finnish-German cables on Nov. 17 and Nov. 18, the dates the cables were damaged. The Swedish government has declined to publicly comment specifically on the ship but confirmed that a police investigation, supported by the Coast Guard and the Armed Forces, is underway. The Yi Peng 3 is owned by the Ningbo Yipeng Shipping company based near Ningbo in eastern China. A company spokesperson confirmed to the Financial Times that the Chinese government had asked the company to cooperate with the investigation but declined to provide further details. Telecom cables linking two Nordic countries with Germany and Lithuania were cut at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, raising suspicion of sabotage, various media outlets reported on Nov. 18. This incident comes a little more than two years after unknown actors blew up the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, as well as amid mounting warnings of Russian hybrid and sabotage operations across Western countries, namely in the Baltic Sea region. China is Russia&apos;s leading geopolitical partner, and NATO countries have accused Beijing of directly supporting Moscow&apos;s war of aggression in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/sweden-investigates-chinese-ship-possible-role-in-baltic-sea-cable-damage/	2024-11-20T02:44:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182217094--1-.jpg
Putin is weaker than US' — Zelensky outlines US role in ending war in Ukraine	The end of the war in Ukraine depends more on the United States than on Russia, as the Russian president &quot;is weaker,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Fox News published on Nov. 19. Zelensky talked to the U.S. outlet when Ukraine marked the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. The milestone comes as the U.S. military aid to Ukraine is in question as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. Answering the question of whether Putin is the person who can decide to end the war, Zelensky said that a lot depends on the Russian president but even more on the U.S. &quot;I&apos;m sure that, as of today, it depends on Putin, really a lot. He can do that. He can be willing and end this war,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;But it also depends on the U.S. much more. Putin is weaker than the U.S. The U.S. president has the strength, authority, and weapons, and he can decrease the price of energy resources. By the way, I heard the signal in the media from President Trump that he is thinking of decreasing the prices for energy resources, for oil, and it is needed to be done.&quot; Zelensky also believes that Trump will be able to influence Putin to end the war, although it will not be &quot;simple.&quot; The Ukrainian president added that Trump is &quot;stronger&quot; than Putin, as is the U.S. &quot;He&apos;s stronger. The U.S. is stronger. The economy is stronger. The U.S. has a very big influence.&quot; Zelensky suggested that Ukraine risks losing the war if aid from the new U.S. administration is cut. &quot;Of course, anyway, we will stay, and we will fight. We have production, but it&apos;s not enough to prevail. And I think it is not enough to survive.&quot; During the campaign, Trump promised to end Russia&apos;s war with Ukraine if elected, saying in September that he would negotiate a deal &quot;that&apos;s good for both sides.&quot; Trump also said he had not spoken with Putin but added: &quot;I think we&apos;ll speak.&quot; Trump&apos;s election has intensified uncertainty around Ukraine&apos;s war efforts at a critical time, as Russian forces make their fastest gains in months and North Korean troops are stationed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Zelensky was among the first to congratulate the president-elect, who had criticized the extent of U.S. military and financial aid to Kyiv during his campaign and pledged to end the war swiftly without providing details on how he would achieve this.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-is-weaker-than-us-zelensky-says/	2024-11-20T02:23:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416230-1.jpg
North Korean troops in Russia to be led by secrecy-shrouded general close to Kim Jong Un, WSJ reports	Colonel General Kim Yong Bok, one of the generals accompanying North Korean troops in Russia, is a mystery-shrouded figure close to dictator Kim Jong Un, The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 20. Kim Yong Bok, officially the Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff, is expected to oversee the integration of North Korean troops into Russian forces, gain combat experience, and establish a framework for future deployments, the outlet reports. A Ukrainian envoy listed him, along with Major General Sin Kum Cheol and Colonel General Ri Chang Ho, during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Oct. 30 as one of the generals commanding some over 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia. Kim&#x2019;s role in Pyongyang&#x2019;s military has long been shrouded in secrecy. He previously commanded a special forces unit of 200,000 soldiers tasked with covert missions on the Korean Peninsula. His profile was elevated after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea in June, with reports identifying him as the No. 3 figure in the Korean People&apos;s Army, according to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s reporting. In July 2020, Kim was seen alongside Kim Jong Un at a ceremony honoring military officials but largely disappeared from public view until recently. This deployment coincides with North Korea&#x2019;s formalized mutual defense treaty with Russia, announced on Nov. 12. The agreement obligates the nations to assist each other in the event of an armed attack. The development follows reports of initial clashes between Ukrainian forces and North Korean troops in Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast. The Western countries denounced the deployment of North Korean troops as an escalation, with the U.S. reportedly responding by permitting Ukraine to launch ATACMS missiles against Russian and North Korean troops amassing in the region.	https://kyivindependent.com/kim-yong-bok/	2024-11-20T01:45:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1125139920.jpg
Putin open to discussing Ukraine ceasefire with Trump, Reuters reports	Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump but rejects major territorial concessions and insists that Ukraine abandon plans to join NATO, Reuters reported on Nov. 20. For the first time, five current and former Russian officials outlined to Reuters the Kremlin&#x2019;s potential terms for a Trump-brokered peace deal. These could include freezing the conflict &quot;broadly&quot; along current front lines and &quot;dividing control&quot; of eastern regions, including the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts. Moscow, which illegally declared annexation of these regions in September 2022, currently controls only 70-80% of them, with approximately 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 square miles) under Ukrainian control. Putin issued a demand in June that Ukraine must withdraw from the four regions completely before any ceasefire talks. Russia currently occupies roughly a fifth of Ukraine&apos;s territory &#x2013; including Crimea &#x2013; as its forces continue to steadily advance in the east. Publicly, the Kremlin has rejected freezing the front line or any concessions on its part, with Putin saying any peace deal must be in Moscow&apos;s favor. According to Reuters, Russian officials suggested that Moscow might consider withdrawing from smaller occupied areas in Ukraine&#x2019;s Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions but emphasized that any deal must reflect &quot;realities&quot; on the ground. Moscow remains firmly opposed to NATO membership for Ukraine or the presence of foreign troops on Ukrainian soil, the officials said. Additional demands could reportedly include limiting Ukraine&#x2019;s military size and guaranteeing unrestricted use of the Russian language. Ukraine has rejected territorial concessions and said any peace talks should be based on its 10-point peace formula, which includes a Russian withdrawal and full territorial integrity and sovereignty. Officials acknowledged that some territories might be returned through diplomacy rather than military means. Kyiv also said that NATO membership is the only way to prevent further Russian aggression. Without a ceasefire, Russia will continue the war, Kremlin sources told Reuters. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the U.S. authorization of ATACMS missiles a &quot;very dangerous escalation.&quot; Trump has positioned himself as a potential peace broker, claiming he could negotiate an end to the war. The contours of Trump&apos;s peace plan remain unclear, though media reports indicate it might entail postponing Ukraine&apos;s NATO membership for 20 years, freezing the front line, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east manned by European troops.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-trump-ceasefire/	2024-11-20T01:01:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-872780694.jpg

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast&apos;s Nikopol district, a 46-year-old woman suffered injuries. Russian forces attacked the area with artillery, kamikaze drones, and Grad multiple rocket launchers. The Russian military targeted the city of Nikopol and four local communities over the past day, according to Governor Serhii Lysak.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-against-ukraine-kill-2-injure-30-over-past-day/	2024-11-20T00:14:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-20-09_58_54.jpeg
Ukrainian drones allegedly strike Russian factories, weapons arsenal	Ukraine reportedly targeted Russian facilities with drones as the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 20 that air defense forces shot down 44 drones overnight. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that drone wreckage damaged the premises of an enterprise in the town of Alekseevka on Nov. 19. Media reports identified the facility as an EFKO plant, officially a sauce manufacturer. Separately, drone strikes were reported also in Voronezh Oblast, with local authorities claiming that five drones struck a civilian industrial facility, starting a fire. The Voronezh and Belgorod oblasts lie at the border with Ukraine and are regularly targeted in cross-border drone strikes. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&#x2019;s National Security and Defense Council&apos;s counter-disinformation center, said that the EFKO plant also secretly produces cargo drones used by the Russian military. The official said that Ukrainian drones also attacked the 13th Arsenal of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry (GRAU) near Kotovo in Novgorod Oblast, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) from Ukraine&#x2019;s border. According to Kovalenko, the arsenal stores critical military supplies, including artillery shells, multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) missiles, Iskander and anti-aircraft missiles, and ammunition for various systems, including the Tor complex. Russia&apos;s Defense Ministry claimed that 22 drones were shot down over Novgorod Oblast overnight. 0:00/1&#xD7;Footage that purports to show drone strike against Voronezh Oblast, Russia, overnight on Nov. 20, 2024. (Astra/Telegram)The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. These strikes come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced plans on Nov. 19 to scale up domestic production of long-range drones and missiles. As part of Ukraine&#x2019;s resilience plan, the country aims to manufacture at least 30,000 long-range drones in the coming year and establish a new technology center to enhance its defense capabilities. Ukrainian forces struck a military arsenal in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast, overnight on Nov. 19, with some reports indicating that Kyiv deployed U.S. ATACMS missiles for the first time on Russian soil.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-strikes-russia-factory-weapons-arsenal/	2024-11-19T23:42:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2165561187.jpg
Biden reportedly approves delivery of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine in light of Russian gains in east	U.S. President Joe Biden approved the provision of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine, which is expected to help slow down Russia&apos;s advance in the east of the country, the Washington Post (WP) and several other outlets reported on Nov. 19, citing undisclosed U.S. officials. The move follows the Biden administration&apos;s authorization of the use of U.S.-made long-range missiles to strike Russian territory. Kyiv has not officially confirmed the claims, but recent reports indicate Ukraine deployed U.S. ATACMS missiles in Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast. The transfer of anti-personnel mines could be controversial, as it contradicts the Ottawa Convention, also known as the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty, which has been signed by more than 160 countries. Russia and the U.S. are not signatories to this initiative. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Washington has been supplying Kyiv with anti-tank mines, while Ukrainian forces have been looking for opportunities to obtain infantry mines over the past three years. Moscow has used anti-personnel mines without restriction at the front line, hampering the progress of the Ukrainian military. Biden was reluctant to supply Ukraine with mines due to doubts in his administration and the risk to civilians. Yet Washington is now concerned about Russia&apos;s rapid advance in eastern Ukraine and sees the need to halt it, U.S. officials told the WP. &quot;Russia is attacking Ukrainian lines in the east with waves of troops, regardless of the casualties that they&apos;re suffering,&quot; one of the officials said. &quot;So, the Ukrainians are obviously taking losses, and more towns and cities are at risk of falling. These mines were made specifically to combat exactly this.&quot; One U.S. official described the mines for Ukraine as &quot;non-resistant,&quot; meaning that they self-destruct or lose battery power to render them inactive within days or weeks, reducing the danger to civilians, the WP reported. The official said Kyiv had committed to not installing these mines in densely populated areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-anti-personnel-mines-to-ukraine/	2024-11-19T23:16:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1903200714.jpg
No signs Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Pentagon says	The Pentagon said on Nov. 19 that while Russia has updated its nuclear doctrine, there are no indications that it is preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh dismissed Russia&#x2019;s rhetoric surrounding its nuclear policy as a continuation of its behavior over the past two years. The comments came shortly after Russia updated its nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for a nuclear retaliation in an open warning to the West. &quot;It&#x2019;s the same irresponsible rhetoric that we&#x2019;ve seen before,&quot; Singh said. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to continue to monitor, but we don&#x2019;t have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine.&quot; The spokesperson stressed that Russia&apos;s involvement of troops from a third country marks a clear escalation. According to her, the administration warned Moscow that if North Korean troops were deployed, the United States would help Ukraine respond and &quot;provide Ukraine with what it needs.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin approved updates to Russia&#x2019;s nuclear deterrence policy, which were published on a government website on Nov. 19.The revised doctrine expands scenarios justifying a nuclear strike, including &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks, such as those involving drones.	https://kyivindependent.com/pentagon-russia-nuclear-weapons/	2024-11-19T23:00:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1459767214.jpg
US Embassy in Kyiv warns of 'potential significant' Russian aerial attack on Nov. 20	The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said it had received &quot;specific information&quot; about a possible major Russian aerial attack on Nov. 20, urging U.S. citizens to be ready to take shelter. &quot;Out of an abundance of caution, the Embassy will be closed, and Embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,&quot; the statement read. The warning comes shortly after Russia launched one of its largest combined missile and drone attacks on Nov. 17, firing 210 drones and missiles. Russia has ramped up the frequency of its drone strikes against Ukraine over the past few months, with air raid alerts sounding off in the capital nearly on a daily basis. As a result of an overnight drone attack on Nov. 20, debris fell in the Dniprovskyi district of Kyiv, starting a fire, officials reported. Moscow&apos;s forces also launched a number of deadly attacks against Ukrainian cities and towns in the past week, including Odesa, Sumy, and Hlukhiv in Sumy Oblast. Six &#xA0;Russian missile carriers capable of launching Kalibr cruise missiles are currently delpoyed in the Black Sea, the Navy warned in the morning.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-embassy-in-kyiv-warns/	2024-11-19T22:31:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/08/GettyImages-1221111502.jpg
General Staff: Russia has lost 725,740 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 24, 2022	Russia has lost 725,740 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported on Nov. 20. This number includes 1,690 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Increasing number of Ukrainians favor peace talks, poll suggests	As attitudes around potential future peace negotiations continue to shift in Ukraine, 52% of Ukrainians now say that they would like to see their country negotiate an end to the war &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; according to a survey published by Gallup on Nov. 19. The survey, released ahead of the anticipated harsh winter months amid Russian energy attacks, highlights that approximately 10% to 12% of Ukraine&apos;s population living in Russian-occupied territories were excluded from the poll. The poll, released on the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, indicates a progressive shift in sentiments surrounding the end of the war, with only about four in ten, 38%, respondents saying that the country should &quot;continue fighting until it wins the war.&quot; In 2022, following the start of the all-out war, a record 73% of respondents believed Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins, dropping to 63% in 2023, according to Gallup&apos;s finding. The shift represents a 25 percentage point decrease year-over-year between 2023 and 2024. The poll, which did not ask about details regarding a timeline for negotiations, falls in contrast with another survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) released on Nov. 4 that showed that 63% of Ukrainians ready to endure the war as long as necessary. Among those surveyed in the Gallup poll who would be open negotiating peace as soon as possible, 52% would be open to making territorial concessions as part of a peace deal with 38% against concessions &#x2014; though the specifics of the potential territorial concessions were not outlined in the survey. The responses to the survey likely fall in line with comments made by President-elect Donald Trump, who pledged to end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine &quot;within 24 hours.&quot; Mike Waltz, Trump&apos;s pick for a national security advisor, told Voice of America on Nov. 13 that Trump wants to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table to end the war. The change in sentiment is also likely reflected in comments made by Ukrainian officials over the past year. Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko said in May that Ukraine &quot;clearly understands&quot; that Russia&apos;s full-scale war will end with negotiations. President Volodymyr Zelensky has more recently said that the country must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025, adding that a war would &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration. Support for an immediate end to the war through negotiations is most popular among Ukraine&apos;s front-line eastern regions, with just 27% of respondents in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kharkiv oblasts saying that Kyiv should continue to fight until it wins the war &#x2014; down from 63% in 2022. Despite Trump&apos;s insistence on quickly settling the war, 70% of respondents most trust European Union countries to play a significant role in a potential negotiated peace, with only 49% of supportive of the United States under a Trump administration having a significant role. A further 63% of respondents were in favor of having the United Kingdom play a significant role. The Gallup poll involved approximately 1,000 Ukrainian adults from all regions of the country and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points 19 times out of 20.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainians-poll/	2024-11-19T22:07:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/peace-summit.jpg
US to announce $275 million military aid package to Ukraine, AP reports	The U.S. is preparing to announce a military aid package for Ukraine worth about $275 million, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Nov. 19, citing U.S. officials. The latest aid package comes as the Biden administration rushes to deliver the remaining approximately $7 billion in military aid to Ukraine ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, amid concerns that a future Trump administration would halt weapons shipments before they reach Kyiv. Two administration officials told Politico on Nov. 6 that the White House plans to expedite the weapons delivery ahead of the January 2025 inauguration, as Trump has previously said he would cease military aid to Ukraine unless it agrees to hold peace negotiations with Russia. The new aid package will include HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) ammunition, artillery shells, and Javelin surface-to-air missiles, in addition to a wide range of spare parts and equipment, according to officials. The new aid package, which is expected to be announced this week, will be provided under presidential drawdown authority, pulling weaponry from existing U.S. stockpiles. The U.S. most recently announced the delivery of a $425 million military aid package for Kyiv on Nov. 1. Despite the president&apos;s ability to deliver existing weapons stocks through presidential drawdown authority, White House officials are concerned that the delivery of the large amount of undelivered weapons may take months to reach Ukraine &#x2014; well past Trump&apos;s inauguration into office. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Oct. 30 said the U.S. has transferred to Ukraine only about 10% of the $61 billion aid approved by Congress in April 2024. Of the $61 billion aid package, only $4.3 billion remains to pull existing weapons stocks, while a further $2.1 billion in funding remains to put weapons on contract with U.S. defense companies. The latest military aid package comes amid a significant shift in U.S. policy as President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia on Nov. 17. Ukraine reportedly used ATACMS to strike Russian territory for first time on Nov. 19, striking a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast.	https://kyivindependent.com/us-to-announce-275-million-military-aid-package-to-ukraine-ap-reports/	2024-11-19T19:17:52-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603402.jpg
Russia behind recent bomb threats at Czech, Slovak schools, Czech intelligence chief says	Michal Koudelka, the director of the Czech Security Information Service, said on Nov. 18 that Russia was behind a flurry of bomb threats made against schools in Czechia and Slovakia in recent months. Intelligence agencies across Europe have warned that Russia is plotting violent acts of sabotage across the continent in response to countries&apos; support for Ukraine. Hundreds of Czech and Slovak schools received bomb threats sent over email after schools returned from their summer break in September, leading to multiple school closures, local media reported. Following the threat, local police found no credible evidence of explosives or improvised devices surrounding the schools. &quot;There is a clearly visible Russian trace&quot; concerning the bomb threat, Koudelka told Czech parliamentarians during a briefing on the threats posed by Russian cyberattacks to the country&apos;s national security. Russia has long engaged in a variety of disruptive behavior toward Europe, also using its cyber capabilities to target civilian infrastructure. Prague has regularly been targeted by Russia through cyberattacks beginning in 2023. At a conference in Prague on Oct. 9, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said that Moscow is responsible for 80% of all the foreign influence operations in the world. Ahead of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Czechia authorities expelled 18 Russian diplomats in response to deadly 2014 warehouse blast that Russia was reportedly responsible for. Various media outlets reported on Nov. 18 that several Telecom cables linking two Nordic countries with Germany and Lithuania were cut at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, raising suspicion of Russian sabotage.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-behind-recent-bomb-threats-at-czech-slovak-schools-czech-intelligence-chief-says/	2024-11-19T18:21:16-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2169317481.jpg
Poland signs deal with domestic companies to kickstart ammunition production	Poland has signed a letter of intent with domestic companies to begin producing nitrocellulose and multi-base powders essential for ammunition manufacturing, according to a Polish government report published on Nov. 18. This marks a significant step in rebuilding Poland&apos;s ammunition production capabilities, which currently rely on imports from several European countries and Canada. The government plans to invest 3 billion zlotys ($750 million) to enhance ammunition production, in response to observations from Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine. &quot;No one who observes the war in Ukraine and other conflicts in the world today can have any doubts about how important it is to have access to a large amount of ammunition for modern weapons,&quot; Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said. State-owned companies, including Grupa Azoty and PGZ, agree on the need to establish a factory for the development of these materials. PGZ board member Marcin Idzik highlighted the need to produce 155mm artillery rounds, to prepare for potential future conflicts involving NATO. Poland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine since the start of all-out war in February 2022, providing billions of dollars in military, economic, and humanitarian aid and hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees. The country has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Ukraine to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun.	https://kyivindependent.com/poland-signs-deal-with-domestic-companies-to-kickstart-ammunition-production/	2024-11-19T16:43:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1242568859.jpg
Ukrnafta acquires 51% share in Shell's gas station network in Ukraine	Ukrnafta, a state-owned oil and gas extraction company that is a subsidiary of Naftogaz, has bought a 51% stake in Shell&apos;s gas station network in Ukraine, the press service of Naftogaz reported on Nov. 19. Ukrnafta will now hold a majority stake in a network of 118 operational gas stations. Shell, one of Ukraine&#x2019;s top 10 fuel networks, ranks number 9 in fuel sales and number 7 in station numbers, with most stations located in high-traffic areas. All 1,550 employees will keep their jobs, and rebranding is set to be completed within a year. According to Oleksiy Chernyshov, CEO of Naftogaz Group, the profits from this business will be directed to the national budget as dividends. Natural gas production in Ukraine in October increased to the highest level since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, exploration and production consulting company EXPRO reported on its website on Nov. 6. According to EXPRO&#x2019;s calculations, gross natural gas production rose by 2.3% in October 2024 compared to the same month last year, reaching 1.663 billion cubic meters, the highest level since January 2022. Ukraine&#x2019;s gas production also grew by 2% this year, while daily production rates rose by 1.3%.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrnafta-acquires-51-share-in-shells-gas-station-network-in-ukraine/	2024-11-19T15:16:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1153940142.jpg
Ukraine beats Albania 2:1, earns chance to advance to Nations League top tier	The Ukraine national football team scored two goals to Albania&apos;s one, earning the second-place spot in the Nations League&apos;s Group B1. Ukraine&apos;s Oleksandr Zinchenko opened the score on the 5th minute after a shot from outside the box. Five minutes later, Roman Yaremchuk doubled the score. Despite having eight shots on target compared to Albania&apos;s two, the ending was tense following a successfully converted penalty by Nedim Bajrami on the 75th minute. Ukraine struggled through the tournament, losing the first two games of the group stage to Albania and the Czech Republic. Following a victory over Georgia and two draws with the Czech Republic and Georgia, Ukraine found a chance to avoid finishing last in the group.Following the victory over Albania and the Czech win over Georgia, Ukraine secured second place with 8 points. Ukraine now awaits a future draw that will pair it with the third-placed team from one of the tournament&apos;s top-tier groups for a chance at promotion. The UEFA Nations League is a tournament held every two years in between the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship for national teams to be in shape for major tournaments. The league is divided into four tiers, with Ukraine currently competing in the second one and having a chance to return to the top one after a four-year gap.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-beats-albania-2-1-earns-chance-to-advance-to-nations-league-top-tier/	2024-11-19T14:01:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185013367.jpg
UK, Germany, Canada, Luxembourg announce additional $30 million for drone coalition funding	Multiple drone coalition countries have pledged additional funding to support Ukraine with strike and reconnaissance drones, the U.K. government website reported on Nov. 19. The contributors include the U.K. with $9.5 million, Germany with $12.7 million, and Canada and Luxembourg, each providing $3.8 million. The overall fund has surpassed $85 million, with $19 million of the funds coming from the U.K. The coalition, co-led by Latvia and the UK, was launched on February 17, 2024, to strengthen Ukraine&#x2019;s drone capabilities. The coalition was established to bolster Ukraine&apos;s arsenal of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Seven countries, apart from the founding states, have joined the alliance, including Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Sweden, Estonia, and Denmark. Ukraine is also working to scale up domestic production, aiming to produce at least 1 million drones in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-germany-canada-luxembourg-announce-additional-30-million-for-drone-coalition-funding/	2024-11-19T13:35:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2068302945.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Ukraine reportedly uses ATACMS on Russian territory for first time; Zelensky presents resilience plan	Key developments on Nov. 19: The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 19 that Ukraine launched U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, according to the state news agency TASS. This coincides with several Ukrainian media outlets reporting that, according to undisclosed military sources, Ukraine successfully struck a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. If confirmed, this would mark the first instance of Ukraine using U.S.-made long-range missiles on Russian territory since Washington eased the restrictions last week. Kyiv&apos;s forces have previously deployed the weaponry only against Russian targets in occupied Ukrainian territories. The claims could not be independently verified. A Ukrainian military representative declined to comment on the reports for the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian officials previously reported an attack with unspecified weaponry against a Russian arsenal in Karachev overnight on Nov. 19, which reportedly stored artillery ammunition, including North Korean munitions, KAB guided bombs, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launcher ammunition. Twelve secondary explosions could be heard at around 2:30 a.m., the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Karachev residents reported explosions and detonations, including an alleged attack on a &quot;military base,&quot; as shared in local chats and reported by Russian media outlet Astra. The town lies more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Ukrainian border. ATACMS missiles have a maximum range of 300 kilometers (190 miles). In turn, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its forces shot down five and damaged one ATACMS missile. Missile fragments fell on a military facility in Bryansk Oblast and started a fire but inflicted &quot;no casualties or damage,&quot; the ministry claimed. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision earlier this week, said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. Commenting on the reports, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the &quot;missiles will speak for themselves.&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled Ukraine&apos;s 10-point plan for internal resilience in an address to the parliament on Nov. 19. &quot;Ukraine may need to outlive someone in Moscow to achieve all the goals,&quot; Zelensky said, according to lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak&apos;s Telegram channel. &quot;We do not trade security or sovereignty. We will not give up our rights to our entire territory.&quot; The resilience plan follows some criticism Zelensky received after presenting a victory plan this fall that primarily focused on requests from external partners and lacked domestic reforms. &quot;While the whole world is waiting for a miracle from Trump, God willing, we should get to work,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Ukraine may need to outlive someone in Moscow to achieve all the goals,&quot; Zelensky said. The individual points of the new resilience plan were focused on the country&apos;s unity, front-line situation, arms, finances, energy, security, communities, human capital, cultural sovereignty, and veterans, according to Zhelezniak&apos;s Telegram channel. In his presentation to parliament, Zelensky emphasized he is not preparing to lower the mobilization age. Instead, he called for new approaches to management, establishing a military ombudsman, and creating a new contract system for citizens below the age of mobilization. With Ukraine facing sharp manpower shortages, Zelensky has come under pressure both from citizens at home and from U.S. lawmakers abroad to reduce the age of mobilization. Zelensky also said that Ukraine will produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year, and noted that Ukraine has already struck targets using their domestically-produced Neptune cruise missiles. In his speech, he set a goal of producing 3,000 cruise missiles. For veterans, Zelensky proposed new efforts to recruit veterans for public service, creating rehabilitation centers in every community in 2025, introducing 11,000 veteran support specialists in the next year, providing supplementary payments to family physicians treating veterans, and establishing dedicated veteran housing. Financial aspects of the plan included deregulation, insuring military risks, and increased security for businesses from law enforcement pressures. Zelensky also proposed a cultural &quot;Ramstein&quot; to reinforce and export Ukraine culture abroad, including helping to establish Ukrainian studies departments in foreign universities. In regards to unity, Zelensky reportedly restated that the country will not hold any elections until martial law is lifted, and said that further aspects of the plan will be developed in detail in coordination with civil society members, business leaders, and experts. Russian forces claim to have taken the front-line village of Novoselydivka in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 19. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Novoselydivka lies some 7 kilometers (4 miles) north of Kurakhove, an important stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the area that has seen increasingly heavy Russian assaults in the past months. If confirmed, this will be the latest village that the Russian forces took in their attempt to encircle Kurakhove by driving their forces towards Konstiantynopil with a north-south pincer movement. With the best Ukrainian brigades holding Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, Russian troops move forward along the Donetsk front line at a rate not seen since the early weeks of the war. The victory of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in early November adds further uncertainty to Kyiv&apos;s military prospects to hold its defenses across the 1,200-kilometer-long (750 miles) front line as doubt over Washington&apos;s future military aid looms. Outgoing President Joe Biden&apos;s decision to allow Ukraine to use Western-supplied ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia may help in the short run but will not change the general course of the war, observers said. Russian President Vladimir Putin approved updated principles of Russia&apos;s nuclear deterrence policy, according to a presidential decree published on a government website on Nov. 19. The revised doctrine outlines scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike. It implies that this could include &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks, such as those carried out with drones. Putin first proposed changes to the nuclear doctrine during a Sept. 25 Security Council meeting on nuclear deterrence. He claimed that Russia does not need a preventative strike as part of its nuclear doctrine &quot;because, in a retaliatory strike, the enemy will be guaranteed to be destroyed.&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes should be seen as a &quot;certain signal&quot; to the West. &quot;This is a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they take part in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear,&quot; Peskov told the state-run RIA Novosti on Sept. 26. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. More than 50,000 Ukrainian recruits have undergone training in the U.K. as part of the British-led Operation Interflex since June 2022, the U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 19. &quot;Kosovo, Romania, and Estonia are the latest nations to join this global effort, standing united for freedom and resilience,&quot; the Defense Ministry said on X. The project, also supported by 10 other partner countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Australia, provides essential military training to Ukrainian recruits at various facilities. Operation Interflex, led by the U.K., is one of the key programs aimed at preparing Ukrainian troops to defend against Russian aggression. Ukrainian service members have also been receiving military training under other initiatives led either by national governments of partner countries or the EU. British soldiers have been warned that Russia may be using spies and drones to gather intelligence on Ukrainian service members trained in the U.K., according to a report by The Times on Aug. 5. Denmark will allocate 130 million euros ($137.5 million) for the development of the Ukrainian defense industry, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced on Nov. 19 during a joint press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Frederiksen came to Kyiv on Nov. 19 in a surprise visit and met Zelensky on the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It is important to me that our own industry, not only in Denmark but in all neighboring countries, can visit Ukraine and learn from your experience and your ability to expand and develop your production lines,&quot; Frederiksen said. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&apos;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. According to the president, the Ukrainian defense industry has already attracted over $1 billion in line with this financing model from partners, including Norway, which recently joined. Zelensky added that Ukraine should open the defense industry to full cooperation with partners. Denmark, one of Kyiv&apos;s key supporters throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, announced on Oct. 18 a new 2.4 billion kroner ($350 million) military aid package for Ukraine. This was Denmark&apos;s 21st military aid package since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Copenhagen previously provided Ukraine with a military aid package worth around $115 million in August.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-ukraine-reportedly-uses-atacms-on-russian-territory-for-first-time-zelensky-presents-resilience-plan/	2024-11-19T12:31:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1430567940.jpg
Ukrainians optimistic about Trump feel a mix of Biden fatigue and hope for change	Despite warnings from some analysts ahead of the U.S. elections that a win by the Republican nominee Donald Trump could become a &#x201C;worst-case scenario&#x201D; for Ukraine, the mood in Kyiv after his victory was far more mixed. Some Ukrainians are optimistic that the president-elect could improve Kyiv&#x2019;s standing amid Russian ongoing onslaught. &#x201C;I am generally up for changes,&#x201D; said a Special Operations sniper with the callsign Bart, who is currently rehabilitating in Kyiv. &#x201C;I believe that (President Joe) Biden and his administration are impotent,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent the day after the election, adding that a Trump victory could spell more decisive action. The recurring theme among Ukrainian residents hopeful that Trump will turn the tide of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion was an overarching sense of fatigue with the pace of Biden&#x2019;s support for Ukraine and a desire for quicker action. After Trump&#x2019;s victory in 2016, there was &#x201C;huge disappointment and frustration in the air,&#x201D; recalled Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director of foreign policy and international security at the Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center. This year, however, he said he noticed &#x201C;no big expectations, so no big disappointment.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ukrainians are extremely grateful to the United States still, but at the same time, we do understand that part of our problems are because of the Biden administration&#x2019;s policy of escalation management and self-restrictions,&#x201D; Melnyk said. Many Ukrainians predicted that a Kamala Harris election would not have brought about any radical change, he said, while &#x201C;in the case of Trump, this unpredictability gives some people hope.&#x201D; Serhii Fursa, deputy managing director at Kyiv-based investment firm Dragon Capital, said, &#x201C;I feel bad. But markets feel okay, assuming he will end the war.&#x201D; Fursa described the market signal as &#x201C;total uncertainty.&#x201D; Trump has repeatedly said he would end the war within 24 hours, though has not provided details on how he plans to achieve such a result. Not all experts had predicted that a Trump win would be devastating for Ukraine, with some urging a &#x201C;wait-and-see&#x201D; attitude. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It&#x2019;s gotta stop. Russia and Ukraine&#x2019;s gotta stop,&quot; Trump said at an event in Florida on Nov. 14. Optimism in Ukraine following the election was nonetheless cautious and came from three main reasons, said Timothy Garton Ash, an Oxford professor of European Studies, historian, and commentator. &#x201C;First, they were so disappointed with the Biden administration&#x2019;s self-deterrence that they thought something else might be better,&#x201D; he said. Secondly, he added, U.S. politicians who genuinely supported Ukraine signaled that a Trump victory would work out all right. U.S. President Joe Biden meets with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. on Nov. 13, 2024. (Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)&#x201C;And the third reason is probably the most important of all,&#x201D; noted Ash. &#x201C;If you&apos;re fighting a war for your survival, you&apos;ve got to believe that you can win. And if it looks as if your most important single ally is going to pull the rug on you, you know you&apos;re going to keep hoping and put a brave face on it that it&apos;s going to be okay.&#x201D; Still, Ash noted, he believes the optimism is &#x201C;misplaced.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&apos;s quite clear from the first conversations that Trump has had with people, he wants to get the issue off the table. He wants to go as fast as possible for that deal so he can get on to other things,&#x201D; said Ash. &#x201C;So now, optimism or pessimism focuses on the Europeans. Whether the Germans, the French, the British, the Poles and others can step into the breach.&#x201D; Oleksiy Haran, professor of comparative politics at Kyiv Mohyla Academy, however, noted that there was very little concrete data to show how widespread &#x2014; or limited &#x2014; support for Trump was among ordinary Ukrainians. Without polling data, he added, it was difficult to draw conclusions about Ukrainians&#x2019; attitudes. &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t generalize any sentiments for Trump among ordinary Ukrainians,&#x201D; Haran noted. &#x201C;Clearly, there are some people who wanted Trump to win. But we cannot say that this is the majority, or even that this is a significant number of citizens of Ukraine.&#x201D; Even among Ukrainians who expressed positive sentiment about a Trump win, enthusiasm was tempered. &#x201C;The pace of decision-making (in the Biden administration), especially on critical military support, has sometimes been slower than the reality of the situation required,&#x201D; said Vitalii Ivanov, a communications and investment manager at Kyiv-based UFuture. &#x201C;The Trump presidency is likely to introduce a more practical and pragmatic approach to policy making, which could lead to faster decision-making by the administration,&#x201D; Ivanov said. &#x201C;Still, I would like to underline that we need to focus on solving our domestic problems and acting to make our country successful rather than worrying about who wins the U.S. election and what this or that president will do for us.&#x201D; Part of the response in Kyiv can be attributed to Ukraine&#x2019;s recent and historical experience dealing with radical changes, said Melnyk from Razumkov Center. &#x201C;In general, this is kind of the Ukrainian attitude: Ok, it happened. Life goes on.&#x201D; &#x201C;We can speculate about more general things like the peace formula through power or force,&#x201D; said Melnyk. &#x201C;But we have about two months before (Trump&#x2019;s) inauguration to get prepared for different scenarios. Hope is not a strategy.&#x201D; The Kyiv Independent business editor Liliane Bivings and business reporter Dominic Culverwell contributed to this report.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-fatigue-gives-some-ukrainians-optimism-for-trump-while-analysts-warn-hope-is-not-a-strategy/	2024-11-19T12:19:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184603537.jpg
South Korea has not participated in Czech shell initiative for Ukraine, official says	South Korea did not contribute to the Czech initiative to purchase artillery shells for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Tomas Kopecny, Czech government commissioner for the restoration of Ukraine, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Nov. 19. Czechia unveiled its initiative to jointly purchase artillery shells for Ukraine from undisclosed third countries earlier this year, amid shell shortages caused mainly by delays in U.S. assistance. In October, Ukraine received over one-third of the 500,000 155 mm shells expected to be delivered under the Czech initiative by the end of 2024. South Korea did not provide artillery shells of its own production, nor did it make financial contributions to the purchase of shells from other countries under the Czech initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine from third countries, according to Kopecny. &quot;So far, South Korea has not participated in the Czech initiative. From a financial point of view, they were not among the 16 countries that contributed, and they were not among the supplier countries from which we received the shells. This is the situation as of now,&quot; Kopecny said. Thus, the official denied the information previously published in the German media Bild that South Korea was probably one of the ammunition suppliers under the Czech initiative. Earlier, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported that South Korea had no plans to supply 155 mm shells to Ukraine amid reports of North Korean soldiers participating in the war. Since the start of the full-scale war though, South Korean shells have reportedly been sent to Ukraine, but this was done so indirectly, through undisclosed U.S. purchases. On Oct. 22, Seoul announced a possible revision of its support for Kyiv, including the provision of lethal weapons and personnel, depending on the situation in Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/south-korea-has-not-participated-in-czech-initiative-to-purchase-shells-for-ukraine-official-says/	2024-11-19T11:39:59-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1251756590.jpg
Deputy energy minister: How Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has endured over 1,000 attacks in 1,000 days of full-scale war	Over nearly 1,000 days of full-scale war, Russia has attacked Ukraine&#x2019;s energy system more than 1,000 times. Despite this relentless onslaught, Ukrainian power engineers have achieved a historic feat: maintaining energy supply stability by repeatedly repairing equipment, sometimes three or four times after consecutive strikes. This remarkable effort has not only ensured light and heat for Ukrainian homes but has also created a model of resilience and expertise that will be studied by future generations and international energy experts alike. The energy system is stable and prepared for the heating season under normal conditions. However, one constant risk looms: massive Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. The only effective defense remains bolstering Ukraine&#x2019;s air defenses. Russia&#x2019;s primary goal in targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure is to create social unrest and destabilize the nation&#x2019;s rear by cutting off electricity and heating &#x2014; critical for household comfort and economic stability. Since 2022, the nature of these attacks has evolved. Early strikes reflected pre-war planning and Russia&#x2019;s initial military strategy. Over the course of 2023 and 2024, however, the attacks grew more widespread and destructive, with Russia employing more advanced weapons. This year alone, 9 GW of power generation capacity from thermal, combined heat and power, and hydro plants have been disabled. During the largest attack, on Aug. 26, 236 missiles and drones targeted Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. Russia used its most expensive weaponry, including ballistic missiles and cluster munitions valued at over $1 billion, damaging substations critical to nuclear power plants. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has since expanded monitoring at these facilities. In 2023, after extensive destruction, Ukraine began a robust repair campaign and received critical support from international partners. Spare parts from decommissioned European power plants, notably those supplied by Baltic nations, played a vital role in restoring operations quickly, as the production time for new equipment is lengthy. The European Union Delegation to Ukraine launched a platform to provide surplus energy equipment from EU warehouses, offering essential short-term solutions. Additionally, electricity import capacity has increased from 200 MW to 1.7 GW, thanks to prolonged negotiations with EU governments and the G7. This milestone was reached just before the heating season commenced. The foundation of Ukraine&#x2019;s preparedness lies in the restoration of power generation and transmission equipment that could be brought back online before the heating season. This effort included the largest repair campaign in the history of independent Ukraine. Notably, our nuclear power plants (NPPs), which supply around 60% of the country&#x2019;s electricity, are set to operate at full capacity this winter, with nine power units in operation in Ukraine-controlled areas &#x2014; despite the Russian occupation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, Europe&#x2019;s largest nuclear plant.

(Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty Images)A critical factor in meeting demand during the 2024/2025 heating season was the increase in electricity imports. Following assessments of the decisions made in 2023 and their effectiveness, as well as high-level negotiations with EU partners and the European Commission, we successfully raised our import capacity to 2.1 GW on a commercial basis, with an additional 250 MW available for emergency assistance. While the Power System Integration Action Plan, adopted in 2019, outlined a five-year timeline for technical and legal measures to integrate Ukraine into the EU&#x2019;s energy system, Ukraine has accelerated this process and is now de facto integrated, becoming a full member of the EU energy network. Another vital component of our energy strategy is the expansion of distributed generation across the country. The government has created favorable conditions for this development, implementing key decisions to simplify construction and environmental regulations and streamline the process for connecting to electricity and gas networks. Moreover, a series of financial measures have been introduced to support households, condominium associations (COAs), and public utilities in building their own generation facilities. These include interest-free loans for households and low-interest loans for utilities, as well as a zero-rate import duty and VAT on energy goods used for electricity generation. These measures have made it more affordable and efficient to purchase and install the necessary equipment without excessive bureaucracy. In parallel, a collaborative initiative led by the Office of the President, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Regional Development, and regional authorities is underway to develop &#x201C;regional energy independence passports.&#x201D; This effort will assess local energy consumption and identify the needs for backup power, particularly for critical infrastructure. It also takes into account changes in consumption patterns due to internal displacement, population migration, and damage caused by the war. These passports will focus on the development of local gas and electricity networks, ensuring that solutions like solar panels, geothermal energy, wind power, and gas generation are tailored to the region&apos;s specific needs and climate conditions. As a result of these efforts, nearly 2 GW of new generation capacity is already being commissioned, largely driven by commercial and business interests. Simultaneously, international donors have provided local governments and utilities with a significant number of gas generators, cogeneration units, and mobile boiler houses to ensure backup power for critical infrastructure. The success of distributed generation depends on a coordinated effort among local communities, regional administrations, national authorities, and energy companies. This integrated approach is key to ensuring economic independence for communities and fostering energy resilience. Despite the challenges ahead, we have prepared for the 2024/25 heating season. Russia will &#xA0;persist in its efforts to plunge Ukraine into darkness and cold &#x2014; as it did in its 10th mass attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure on Nov. 17 &#x2014; but thanks to the tireless work of power engineers, the collaboration of central and local authorities, and unwavering international support, we are prepared to keep Ukrainian homes warm and well-lit throughout the winter. Trust in the power engineers &#x2014; they have done more than could have been imagined.

Ukraine deserves to make next year a year of peace' — Zelensky addresses European Parliament	Ukraine deserves to make next year a year of peace, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 19 during the European Parliament&apos;s extraordinary session dedicated to the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. &quot;A thousand days of war is a tremendous challenge. Ukraine deserves to make next year a year of peace,&quot; Zelensky said. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, extending their aggression beyond the occupied Donbas region in attempt to effectively end the statehood of independent Ukraine. In his online address, Zelensky thanked the partners for their support and urged them not to forget that &quot;the united strength of Europe&quot; is greater than Russian President Vladimir Putin. &quot;If we could stop Europe&apos;s way of life from falling, then we can surely push Russia towards a just peace,&quot; Zelensky added. The president also stressed the need for tougher sanctions, especially against Russia&apos;s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; that transports crude oil and oil products in circumvention of existing restrictions. &quot;If anyone in Europe thinks they can sell Ukraine &#x2014; or any other country, like the Baltic states, the Balkans, Georgia, or Moldova &#x2014; to Moscow and gain something in return, let them remember this simple truth &#x2014; no one can enjoy calm waters amid a storm.&quot; The milestone comes as Ukraine braces for a difficult and uncertain winter. Russia, on Nov. 17, launched one of its largest aerial attacks yet against Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, leaving civilians dead and injured across multiple regions. The future of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is also in question as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. Meanwhile, thousands of Russian and North Korean forces have amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, preparing to launch a counteroffensive against Ukrainian troops. The escalating situation in Kursk reportedly prompted U.S. President Joe Biden to grant Ukraine permission to use American long-range weapons on Russian territory.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-deserves-to-make-next-year-a-year-of-peace-zelensky-addresses-european-parliament/	2024-11-19T10:49:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1850792057.jpg
1,000 days of full-scale war: Reflections from the Kyiv Independent team	As we mark 1,000 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, members of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s staff have paused to reflect. These reflections offer a glimpse into the profound impact of war &#x2014; not only on a nation&#x2019;s struggle for survival but on those who bear witness to its unfolding. War reporter Although I was in Lviv when the full-scale war started, the first months of the war were something I experienced mostly from the outside &#x2014; through news, at a safe distance from the front line. Those first months had a frantic, superlative energy to them: a time of heroes and legends, but also of horrors and depravity we thought impossible in the 21st century. I joined the Kyiv Independent during the season of liberations &#x2014; a time that remains the most powerful experience of my life. Light and dark existed together: the unbridled jubilation of Kherson&#x2019;s liberation made possible by what Russia had put the city through &#x2014; the tortured, the deported, the stolen, the murdered. Even now, my iPhone suggests musical slideshows of &#x201C;The Great Outdoors: Autumn 2022,&#x201D; filled with pictures of the mass graves in Izium. Back then, we all thought that the next big counteroffensive was just around the corner, and we screamed at the West to act with greater courage and urgency. We knew the road ahead wouldn&#x2019;t be easy, but we didn&#x2019;t anticipate what came next. First, Bakhmut: Russia&#x2019;s dress rehearsal for wave attacks paired with the complete annihilation of cities. Then, the summer counteroffensive, which had taken on such a biblical weight in the lead-up that it left me with a pit in my stomach before it even started. The counteroffensive taught me some important lessons &#x2014; the greatest being the danger of wishful thinking and the necessity of clinging tightly to reality while navigating the darkness of war. Since then, the darkness has only deepened: realizing the West&#x2019;s fear of Ukrainian victory, reckoning with Kyiv&#x2019;s failure to fix internal issues in the military that could turn a stable defense into collapse, and understanding that no amount of individual heroism can stop a glide bomb. Now, winter is coming, bringing with it what feels like a reckoning for Ukraine and the free world. It&#x2019;s a bit hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel at the moment. But, in the meantime, there&#x2019;s no shortage of light to be found around the place &#x2014; in Ukrainians, and especially in Ukrainian soldiers, thanks to whom I can still type this out in free Kyiv.

(Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images)Anna BelokurSocial media managerOne thousand days ago, I woke up in Helsinki, Finland, to a phone full of messages. The top one just said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201D; My friends and I joined hundreds of others holding signs outside the Russian embassy, standing in the snow and dark after the sun set in the early afternoon. Every time someone peeked through the embassy&#x2019;s blinds, the crowd would scream angrily. Finns are deeply reserved people who rarely make eye contact with strangers, but in the days that followed, other dog walkers began nodding at me and exchanging startled looks when cars backfired. There was a heightened awareness that Finland&#x2019;s trademark peacefulness is a gift, not a guarantee. Finns &#x2014; like Ukrainians, Latvians, and a handful of others &#x2014; have a joke: they don&#x2019;t have to deal with deadly insects or hurricanes, but they suffer from the greatest natural disaster of all &#x2014; sharing a border with Russia. Finland has defenses woven into every part of society, from the spots under ordinary bridges designed for detonating explosives to the mandatory year of military service required of every Finnish man. One man told me that training exercises are always based on the assumption of an attack from the east. I don&#x2019;t know a single Finn who wants to fight, but I also don&#x2019;t know a single one who isn&#x2019;t prepared to. Feb. 24, 2022, is the only time I ever heard Finns scream in anger. Writing this from Kyiv 1,000 days later, I draw strength from the fact that Ukraine still has allies who understand what&#x2019;s at stake. These are nations that have closed their borders with Russia, advocated against any form of appeasement, and trained to defend against attacks from the east. Just as I wasn&#x2019;t alone that day, we aren&#x2019;t alone now.

When the war began in 2014, I was in middle school. Growing up in Donetsk Oblast, I remember those early days vividly &#x2014; a child surrounded by adults grappling with the reality of Russian terror. The news of the full-scale invasion came while I was in university in Bulgaria. By then, the decision to return to Ukraine after graduation felt natural. Now an adult, it&apos;s my turn to confront the terror. I do so as part of the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s War Crimes Investigations Unit. In these 1,000 days, the Russian army has committed thousands of war crimes. My team works tirelessly on cases of sexual violence, torture of prisoners of war, civilian murders, and child deportation. People often ask if I&#x2019;m exhausted by the constant exposure to such horror. My answer: my motivation outweighs the exhaustion. Justice is an essential part of Ukraine&#x2019;s victory. It will come when the voices of war crimes victims are heard, and the names of perpetrators are spoken clearly and without fear. Ultimately, our unity and determination will decide whether my children&#x2019;s generation will have to face Russian terror. My hope is that they never will.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)4o miniAsami TerajimaWar reporter A year ago today, I received a Facebook message from a friend serving in the mortar unit of the Ukrainian military&#x2019;s 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade near embattled Chasiv Yar. &#x201C;We have suffered a great tragedy today,&#x201D; he said. I felt a chill, already dreading what he might say. I immediately asked what had happened. I was scrambling to finish packing for a work trip to Kherson, but my mind spiraled toward worst-case scenarios. After a pause, he replied: &#x201C;Three 200s.&#x201D; The military code for killed in action in Ukraine. Any loss is devastating, but you always hope it&#x2019;s not someone close. I opened WhatsApp to check who had been online last and realized my dear friend Vladyslav hadn&#x2019;t logged on since early morning. I soon discovered that three men, including the unit commander and 28-year-old Vladyslav, had been killed by a Russian anti-tank missile. Another friend, who miraculously survived, had to pull out the charred remains of Vladyslav&#x2019;s body from their position. The shock was unbearable. My mind replayed bittersweet summer memories: fishing in the dark before dawn, celebrating birthdays with late-night barbecues. Those golden days &#x2014; despite their nearness to the front line &#x2014; are now irretrievably gone. It&#x2019;s strange how the warm smiles you once took for granted fade into distant memories. Even now, it doesn&#x2019;t feel real that they&#x2019;re gone forever. The cottage-turned-military base where we spent those summers was damaged by Russian shelling this year. What remains are fleeting memories and low-quality iPhone photos. A thousand days into Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war, you develop a numbness to pain &#x2014; a survival mechanism that feels both unsettling and inevitable. It&#x2019;s hard to believe it&#x2019;s been less than three years since I was a 21-year-old university student-turned-journalist on Feb. 24, 2022, questioning whether I had what it took to cover the war. Long gone are the days when World War I-style trench warfare and cluster munitions were only scenes from films. Now, death feels ever-present, a constant reminder of how fragile and fleeting life is.

(Roman Pilipey / AFP via Getty Images)Daryna ShevchenkoCEO It&#x2019;s been exactly 1,000 days since Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion began, and I&#x2019;ve been sleeping like a baby the entire time. I know that&#x2019;s not what you expect to hear from a Ukrainian living in Kyiv, especially when most news reports focus on how Russian attacks deprive the nation of sleep and rest. On Feb. 24, 2022, I woke up to my alarm clock, ready for a normal workday. My phone was buzzing with hundreds of missed calls and messages from colleagues and family. I slept through the explosions, air raid sirens, the noise in my building, kids crying, and dogs barking. It was the last morning in the next 999 days that I woke up feeling rested. Since then, I&#x2019;ve slept through hundreds of overnight attacks, drones flying by my window, and air defense missiles nearby. I thought I was lucky &#x2014; or perhaps more resilient than others &#x2014; until I realized that I had also lost my mornings. Returning to reality became a real challenge over the past three years. I drink coffee, work out, and take walks in fresh air, but nothing helps. I still spend most of my energy fighting for moments of concentration and trying to live life to the fullest. My psychiatrist says excessive sleep under stress isn&#x2019;t normal, just as insomnia isn&#x2019;t. My attempts to convince myself that this is a &#x201C;good sign&#x201D; are a futile search for normalcy. And guess what? Normalcy has nothing to do with war. I&#x2019;ve been lucky not to lose anyone close to me in this war &#x2014; yet. But none of us, here in Ukraine, are emerging unscarred. Lately, I&#x2019;ve seen more comments on social media from foreigners doubting the horrors of Russia&#x2019;s war against Ukraine, looking at photos and videos from Kyiv, Lviv, or Odesa, where dressed-up crowds attend concerts or sit at cafe terraces, appearing so normal. Sleep or no sleep, makeup or blood and bruises, our reality is never normal. Not in the last 1,000 days. The truth is, the only way for the world to preserve its normalcy is to help us recover ours.

(Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Teah PelechatyOpinion editor I wrote this poem in the early months of the full-scale war, before moving to Kyiv in August 2023. At the time, I worked on the Kyiv Independent&#x2019;s news desk from Toronto, bearing witness to the war through a relentless stream of images and reports. A war fought in real time on my screen while the world outside my window remained indifferent, untouched. Rereading this poem now, I realize how the exhaustion of carrying this grief for 1,000 days remains just as heavy as the day I wrote it &#x2014; grief not only for what has been lost but for the unbearable contrast of living in between. Even as I sit here writing, I&apos;ve forgotten.I tend to forget these days. The city I care not to see assaults my eyes,my ears,my nose,with its relentless permanence. The billboard at the corner thrashes red,abrasive and blinking,and in its glare, I see her fingernails &#x2014;also red, but still now, lifeless. At the club,dim lights scatter across the throng,fracturing faces, bodies, limbs &#x2014;suffocating. As bodies crush and contort around me,swaying to a cacophony of Canada&#x2019;s Top Hits,each appendage belongs at once to everyone,to no one. In a mass grave,each appendage belongs at once to everyone,to no one. They are perfect, her fingernails.So meticulously crafted and polished,amaranth red and adhered to a hand that has long gone limp.I wonder if they will remain as her body withers. I forget her face.I tend to forget these days.I forget her face &#x2014;the woman with the red fingernails &#x2014;and yet, I do not search for it. With each subsequent grave &#x2014;Bucha, Mariupol, Izium &#x2014;and with each subsequent face,in my mind&#x2019;s eye,there remain only red fingernails.

(Roman Pilipey /AFP via Getty Images)Kate TsurkanCulture reporter Focusing too much on how many days have passed since the start of the full-scale war only deepens the sorrow I feel when confronted with news of more innocent people who were killed by Russia. In such moments, the future seems distant, fragile &#x2013; a thread barely visible. Counting days can seem meaningless when time itself feels distorted. Plus, this war stretches back over a decade for some Ukrainians, and we can&#x2019;t forget that. What keeps me awake at night is thinking about how this war will shape my daughter and every Ukrainian child, leaving its shadow on their lives long after it ends. (Will it ever truly end?) The only thing I can count on is how I will try to bring kindness and goodness into the world.	https://kyivindependent.com/1-000-days-of-full-scale-war-reflections-from-the-kyiv-independent-team/	2024-11-19T09:13:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1620281416.jpg
Gen.

German opposition criticizes Scholz for refusing to transfer Taurus missiles to Ukraine	Florian Hahn, a member of the German opposition CDU/CSU bloc, criticized Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s decision not to transfer long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, German media outlet Tagesschau reported on Nov. 19. Berlin is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor under Scholz, but the chancellor has been adamant about not providing Taurus missiles, fearing it could draw his country into the war. &quot;The chancellor is once again putting party interests above the interests of Germany&apos;s foreign and security policy,&quot; Hahn said. Scholz wants to enlist the support of the left wing of his Social Democratic Party in the upcoming election campaign, Hahn claimed. Because of his stubborn resistance to providing the missiles, the chancellor was once again perceived as an &quot;indecisive and unreliable&quot; partner on the international level, the politician added. Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition center-right CDU/CSU alliance and potential future Chancellor, said he would allow the delivery of Taurus missiles but only after issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin and lifting restrictions on already provided arms. Current Vice Chancellor and former Green party leader Robert Habeck, also said that if elected, he would also greenlight the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. The German-Swedish-built, air-launched Taurus missiles have a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), which is more than the U.S.-built ATACMS or the Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles provided to Ukraine by the U.K. and France.	https://kyivindependent.com/german-opposition-cdu-csu-bloc-criticizes-scholz-for-refusing-to-transfer-taurus-missiles-to-ukraine/	2024-11-19T08:24:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2076693556.jpg
Denmark to provide over $137 million for Ukrainian defense industry	Denmark will allocate 130 million euros ($137.5 million) for the development of the Ukrainian defense industry, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced on Nov. 19 during a joint press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Frederiksen came to Kyiv on Nov. 19 in a surprise visit and met Zelensky on the 1,000th day of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. &quot;It is important to me that our own industry, not only in Denmark but in all neighboring countries, can visit Ukraine and learn from your experience and your ability to expand and develop your production lines,&quot; Frederiksen said. Denmark became the first country to offer to donate arms to Ukraine via direct purchases from the Ukrainian defense industry, as Kyiv&#x2019;s defense budget does not match the capacities of domestic weapons production. According to the president, the Ukrainian defense industry has already attracted over $1 billion in line with this financing model from partners, including Norway, which recently joined. Zelensky added that Ukraine should open the defense industry to full cooperation with partners. Denmark, one of Kyiv&apos;s key supporters throughout Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, announced on Oct. 18 a new 2.4 billion kroner ($350 million) military aid package for Ukraine. This was Denmark&apos;s 21st military aid package since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Copenhagen previously provided Ukraine with a military aid package worth around $115 million in August.	https://kyivindependent.com/denmark-to-provide-over-137-million-for-ukrainian-defense-industry/	2024-11-19T07:55:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2161108238.jpg
Putin is playing with our fears' — German FM on Russia's updated nuclear doctrine	Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to intimidate the West by expanding the conditions for using nuclear weapons in Russia&#x2019;s updated nuclear doctrine, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Nov. 19. Speaking at a news conference in Poland during a meeting of foreign ministers from Germany, Poland, France, and Italy, Baerbock emphasized that Berlin would heed warnings from Ukraine&apos;s neighboring countries.&quot;We will not let ourselves be intimidated,&quot; she said, adding that this is not the first time the Kremlin has resorted to nuclear threats. Putin&#x2019;s approval of the updated nuclear deterrence policy was confirmed through a presidential decree published on Nov. 19. The revised doctrine expands scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike, including &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks, such as drone strikes. Baerbock accused Russia of exploiting the West&#x2019;s fears but highlighted Europe&#x2019;s unprecedented unity.&quot;After February 2022, the federal government said it would not repeat this mistake a second time. That&apos;s why we are here together, cooperating as Europeans and representing the strongest European countries,&quot; she said.	https://kyivindependent.com/baerbock-putin-nuclear-doctrine/	2024-11-19T05:59:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/baerbock.jpeg
Ukraine state-owned enterprises weekly — Issue 154	Editor&#x2019;s Note: This is issue 154 of Ukrainian State-Owned Enterprises Weekly, covering events from Oct. 24-Nov. 17, 2024. The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission. Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure under attack, first in almost three months; power outage schedules are back. On Nov. 17, Ukraine&#x2019;s energy minister Herman Galushchenko reported that Russia launched another massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s energy infrastructure. According to the minister, Russian troops attacked electricity generation and transmission facilities all over Ukraine. Russia&#x2019;s attack came on the night and morning of Nov. 17, characterized by the use of combined weapons, Ukraine&#x2019;s Air Force said. Russia launched 210 aerial weapons, with Ukraine&#x2019;s air defence downing 102 missiles and 42 drones. Air defense units were responding to Russian aerial targets in almost every Ukrainian region. Ukrenergo reported damaged power facilities and later said that two of its employees were killed in an attack on a substation in Odesa Oblast. Due to the attacks, the company was forced to introduce emergency power outages in several regions. The outages were cancelled later that day, but Ukrenergo announced power outage schedules for Nov. 18 in all Ukrainian oblasts from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time. Rinat Akhmetov&#x2019;s DTEK, Ukraine&#x2019;s largest private energy holding, reported that Russia attacked its thermal power plants (TPPs) again, severely damaging equipment. This is the eighth massive attack on its TPPs in 2024, DTEK added. From March 22 to Aug. 26 Ukraine had faced seven massive missile and drone strikes on electricity facilities. See our Issues 124, 125, 127, 129, 131, 134, and 145 for more detail. The Nov. 17 attack was the first massive one since then. After every Russian mass missile attack on Ukraine&#x2019;s vital infrastructure, emergency outages take place, lasting for days due to the ongoing repair works. During such outages, people in Ukraine are often left without electricity, heating, water supply, or access to mobile phone networks. Ukrenergo in technical default on &#x201C;green&#x201D; bonds. On Nov. 6, Ukrenergo reported that, starting from Nov. 9, it will temporarily suspend payments on debt obligations for green sustainable development bonds ($825 million) issued in 2021 under a state guarantee. Ukrenergo emphasized that this technical measure will remain in effect until the debt restructuring is completed, which is planned in the coming months. &#x201C;The bondholders of the company have been and will continue to be important partners of Ukrenergo. In 2022, the parties agreed to defer bond repayments, which helped to support the company during wartime and significantly contributed to its financial resilience over the past two years. In the near future, the company intends to engage with the group of bondholders to agree on fair and mutually acceptable amendments to the terms of the bonds to ensure long-term financial stability,&#x201D; the company said. The Helsinki District Court freezes Russian assets in Finland at Naftogaz&#x2019;s request. On Oct. 28, Naftogaz announced that the Helsinki District Court had granted its motion, ordering the freezing of certain assets owned by Russia in Finland. These include real estate and other assets valued in the tens of millions of dollars. This decision is part of Naftogaz&#x2019;s global strategy to recover compensation for losses resulting from the seizure of its assets in Crimea, as ordered by the Hague Arbitration Tribunal, the company explained. It is also the first publicly known successful asset freeze outside Ukraine in the enforcement of arbitration awards filed by Ukrainian companies against Russia for the expropriation of property in Crimea in 2014. This is an interim step toward the actual recovery of assets in favour of Naftogaz, the press release reads. &#x201C;Since Russia refuses to voluntarily pay Naftogaz the compensation stipulated by the Hague ruling, we continue to leverage all available mechanisms to recover these funds. Today, we are one step closer to restoring justice. Simultaneously, we are actively pursuing enforcement of the arbitration award in other target jurisdictions where Russian assets are located,&#x201D; Naftogaz&#x2019;s CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov said. As we wrote in April 2023, the Hague&#x2019;s Arbitration Tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration ordered Russia to pay $5 billion to cover Naftogaz&#x2019;s losses in Crimea when Russia seized them in 2014. See our Issue 83 for more detail. Ukraine increases gas production to its highest level since the start of the full-scale war, Ukrgasvydobuvannya and Ukrnafta top the list. According to ExPro&#x2019;s calculations, in October 2024, Ukraine&#x2019;s gas production increased by 2.3% year-on-year to 1.6 billion cubic meters (bcm). This is the highest monthly production since January 2022, prior to Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, the media oulet added. According to ExPro, Ukrgasvydobuvannya, a Naftogaz subsidiary, increased gas production by 1.6% to 1.24 bcm in October 2024. Ukrgasvydobuvannya produced 12.1 bcm in 10 months of 2024, 5.4% more than in 2023. Ukrnafta, another Naftogaz company, increased its gas production by 4.6% to 96.4 million cubic meters in October 2024. The company produced 967 million cubic meters in 10 months of 2024, up 7% year-on-year. At the same time, private companies increased gas production by 4.4% year-on-year to 324 million cubic meters. In total, private companies produced 2.75 bcm in 10 months of 2024, 12% less than in 2023. According to ExPro&#x2019;s forecasts, total gas production in Ukraine may increase by 2.2% to 19.1 bcm in 2024. Chornomornaftogaz receives new contract terms for managing Firtash&#x2019;s gas distribution companies. On Nov. 13, the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA) announced that it had signed a modification agreement with Chornomornaftogaz as the manager of Firtash&#x2019;s seized regional gas distribution companies. According to ARMA, Chornomornaftogaz paid Hr 172 million to the state budget from managing Firtash&#x2019;s companies in 2022 [5.01 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period). At the same time, the manager guaranteed to pay more than Hr 500 million from managing these assets in 2023 [12.6 million euros at the average exchange rate over that period, ARMA added. In our earlier issues, we reported on the wave of taking over fugitive tycoon Dmytro Firtash&#x2019;s gas distribution companies by Naftogaz: As a result, Naftogaz Group now operates 27 gas distribution companies, which were planned to be transferred to state control by the end of 2023, Naftogaz explained. As we wrote in Issue 113, the integration of regional gas companies positioned Naftogaz as a monopoly in gas distribution, but it is a wartime measure, and they should be privatized via public auctions when &#x201C;the situation allows this,&quot; Naftogaz&#x2019;s CEO Oleksii Chernyshov said one year ago. As we wrote in Issue 126, Chornomornaftogaz, as the manager of Firtash&#x2019;s seized regional gas distribution companies, paid Hr 63.6 million, or 1.5 million euros at the going exchange rate, in 2022 dividends. As we wrote in Issue 138, on June 25, the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) revoked the seizure of shares in gas distribution companies held by Firtash&#x2019;s Regional Gas Company (RGC). On the same day, ARMA reported that it had already appealed to the Prosecutor General&#x2019;s Office to re-arrest the companies. Later that day, ARMA said that Kyiv&#x2019;s Pechersk District Court returned them to state ownership. The winning bidder pays $60.5 million for Ukraine Hotel in Kyiv. On Oct. 30, the State Property Fund of Ukraine (SPFU) announced that Ola Fine LLC, the winner of the privatization auction, had fully paid Hr 2.5 billion ($60.5 million) for the hotel itself and Hr 502 million ($12 million) in VAT. These funds will be used, in particular, to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the SPFU added. According to the Economy Ministry, as of the end-March 2024, the hotel&#x2019;s wage arrears amounted to Hr 3.9 million ($94,000), budget arrears stood at Hr 10.8 million ($261,000), and overdue accounts payable totaled Hr 21 million ($508,000). In addition, the buyer must provide social guarantees in accordance with the law and may not lay off employees for six months. As we wrote in Issue 148, on Sept. 18, the SPFU sold Kyiv&#x2019;s four-star Ukraine Hotel for Hr 2.5 billion ($60.5 million). According to the SPFU, Ukraine Hotel has 363 rooms, six conference halls, meeting rooms, a shelter with a separate auditorium for events for 50 people, and a parking lot for 80 cars. Ola Fine LLC is owned by businessman Maksym Krippa. The auction winner had 30 working days to pay the lot price. As we reported in Issue 148, Maksym Krippa, a businessman that avoids publicity, became famous in 2022 when Forbes Ukraine wrote that he had acquired a major Ukrainian e-sports brand, the NAVI team. Later, the businessman&#x2019;s representatives confirmed that the deal was concluded back in 2018. Krippa also owns Maincast e-sports broadcasting studio. In 2023, he acquired GSC Game World, a company that developed the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. cyber game. Krippa, who acquired the Brovary Wholesale Market back in 2009, has recently started buying up significant real estate objects in Kyiv. In 2020, he purchased the Dnipro Hotel in Kyiv, which is located near Ukraine Hotel; and at the end of 2023, the Parus Business Center, previously owned by businessman and former MP Vadym Stolar. See more on Krippa in Issue 148. The sale of Ukraine Hotel increased privatization proceeds to Hr 5.7 billion ($138 million), the Economy Ministry reported on Oct. 31. This is already Hr 1.7 billion more than the revenue planned for 2024, the Ministry added. As we wrote in Issue 114, the 2024 state budget projected the privatization revenue at Hr 4 billion (around &#x20AC;95 million). According to a recent SPFU report, privatization generated UAH 2 billion (&#x20AC;46.7 million) in January-August 2024. All these proceeds were from small-scale privatisation. In other words, as we wrote, the privatization of Ukraine Hotel alone has generated more revenue than all small-scale privatisations since the beginning of this year. After Ola Fine paid up as required by the regulations, the SPFU&#x2019;s privatization revenue plan for 2024, however modest, was achieved for the first time in many years. Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi port finally sold. According to Prozorro.Sale, the twelfth attempt to sell the port was held on Oct. 31, and it failed again due to the absence of bidders. The starting price was Hr 178 million ($4.3 million). As we explained earlier in October, it was doubtful that the asset would attract bidders this time. See Issue 152 for detail. However, the thirteenth attempt, on Nov. 8, was successful. The starting price was halved to Hr 89 million ($2.1 million), and only one bidder, Top Offer LLC, took part in the auction. The company offered Hr 90 million ($2.2 million) for the asset. To complete the privatization, the bidder must pay that price and the VAT, a total of Hr 108 million ($2.6 million). Despite abundant releases on privatization on the SPFU&#x2019;s website, including news on minor events, there is no dedicated release on the successful sale of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, in which the SPFU would provide more detail. According to YouControl, Top Offer LLC was registered in late 2023 in Kyiv. Its primary registered line of business is the lease and operation of owned or leased real estate. The company is owned by Yevhen Boguslavskyi, who also owns the financial company Inkam. At the beginning of 2023, commissioned by an unnamed investor, Inkam acquired MR Bank&#x2019;s lot which included the rights to a loan secured by the Tsarsky fitness club in Kyiv. Later, Top Offer LLC participated in the privatization auction for the Kyiv Prosthetic Plant but lost to another bidder. Boguslavskyi said he could not disclose the details of the privatization due to his NDA with the investor. According to him, the name of the seaport&#x2019;s new owner may become known within a month. Boguslavsky also refused to discuss the origin of the money for the purchase. &#x201C;In this project, I am acting in the investor&#x2019;s interest. He did not share all his plans with me. But I can say that he would restore the bridge across the Dniester estuary in Zatoka (which was destroyed by Russian missile attacks. It would not be this year, though, because not everything would happen at once,&#x201D; Boguslavsky explained. The first privatization auction for Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in March 2023 failed as no one registered. At the second auction, the seaport was sold for Hr 220 million (around 5.6 million euros at the time) to Ukrdoninvest LLC, a company owned by Ukrainian businessman Vitaliy Kropachov. However, Ukrdoninvest decided not to pay up. As we reported in April 2023 (Issue 85), the company said that it backed out while hashing out the terms of the purchase agreement with SPFU&#x2019;s regional office in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts. In June 2023, SPFU announced that it would put Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi up for privatization for a third time, another attempt that failed (see Issue 93).&#x202F;In Issues 99 and 100, we reported about the following failed attempts to sell the port. As we wrote in August 2024 (Issue 144), former deputy infrastructure minister Viktor Dovhan posted on Facebook suggesting that Polish investors were considering participating in the privatization of the port. However, the ninth attempt to sell Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi also failed (see Issue 147), as did the tenth and eleventh (see Issue 148). As we also wrote in Issue 147, according to CASE Ukraine, despite the attractiveness of the asset, there were no bidders because the port had debts of Hr 151.3 million ($3.6 million as of today), which the winner would normally also have to settle, in addition to paying the purchase price and VAT (20%). If that information is (still) correct, the winning bidder would have to spend a total of Hr 259 million ($6.2 million) on the asset, including the seaport&#x2019;s purchase price, VAT, and outstanding debts. However, we are not aware of any information from the SPFU on this matter. For more on the history of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi&#x2019;s privatization, see SOE Weekly&#x2019;s Issues 74, 78, 79, 84, 85, 87, 93, 99, 100, 144, 147, 148, and 152. SPFU officially takes over 49% of Shell petrol station chain in Ukraine, previously owned by sanctioned Khudainatov. On Nov. 5, the SPFU reported that it had become the owner of 49% of the share capital of Alliance Holding LLC, which operates Shell petrol station chain in Ukraine. Eduard Khudainatov, a former top manager of the Russian state-owned company Rosneft, owns Independent Oil and Gas Company. In June 2022, he was sanctioned by the European Union, and in October 2022, by Ukraine. Following a ruling by the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC), Khudainatov&#x2019;s Ukrainian assets, including his share in Alliance Holding LLC, were seized by the state. Pursuant to this ruling, the previous owners of Alliance Holding LLC, Cicerone Holding B.V., and Bogstone Holding B.V. were removed from the company&#x2019;s list of founders, liga.net added. The new ownership structure was approved: Shell Overseas Investments B.V., 51%; and the SPFU, 49%. The SPFU also noted that it was preparing to privatize its 49% stake in the Shell petrol station chain. As we wrote in Issue 130, the SPFU reported that it obtained control over 49% over Shell chain in April 2024. According to Forbes Ukraine, before Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion, Shell had 131 petrol stations in Ukraine, 118 of which still operated in April 2024. See Issue 130 for more detail.

Ukraine readies to start 1st cluster of EU accession talks in early 2025, Zelensky says	Ukraine is preparing to begin the first cluster of accession talks with the EU in early 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainian lawmakers on Nov. 19. &quot;Ukraine should have the fastest accession process in the EU,&quot; Zelensky said while unveiling the country&apos;s internal resilience plan. According to the president, the EU will soon complete the screening of Ukraine&apos;s legislation, which is the first step on the integration path. Ukraine applied for EU membership days after Russia launched its full-scale war in February 2022 and received candidate status in June of that year. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, marking a pivotal step in its integration efforts. The accession process formally began in June with opening talks in Luxembourg. According to Commissioner for Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi, Ukraine could join the European Union by 2029 if it completes the necessary reforms. To advance this goal, the EU has introduced specific initiatives, such as the &quot;Growth Plan&quot; and the &quot;Ukraine Plan,&quot; aimed at accelerating reform processes in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans. Ukraine submitted its plan on March 20, detailing its vision for reconstruction, modernization, and reforms essential to its EU accession journey. The European Commission has recently praised Ukraine&#x2019;s progress on critical reforms, including those related to the rule of law, judicial system, and anti-corruption measures, though it emphasizes that further reforms are still required.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-readies-to-start-1st-cluster-of-eu-accession-talks-in-early-2025-zelensky-says/	2024-11-19T05:35:08-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177959215-1.jpg
EU ready to step up support for Ukraine if US reduces aid, Polish FM says	Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski announced on Nov. 19 that major EU countries are prepared to step up military and financial assistance to Ukraine if the U.S. reduces its support under President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration. Sikorski, speaking after a meeting of European foreign ministers in Poland, stressed the importance of Europe taking greater responsibility for its security. &quot;Strengthening Europe&#x2019;s defense capabilities must go hand in hand with maintaining the United States&#x2019; commitment to enhancing our security,&quot; noted Sikorski, as quoted by the Polish magazine Wprost. The statement comes amid growing uncertainties about Western support for Ukraine as Trump has previously criticized military aid for Kyiv and voiced intention to push toward a quick peace deal. Sikorski said that he and Kaja Kallas, the incoming EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, discussed strategies to bolster support for Ukraine. &quot;I gratefully acknowledge the readiness of the largest EU countries to take on the burden of military and financial support for Ukraine in the event of a potential reduction in U.S. involvement,&quot; he added. Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago event in Florida on Nov. 14 that his administration will focus on the Russia-Ukraine war. He hinted on Nov. 13 at appointing a peace envoy to lead negotiations aimed at ending the war, according to Fox News.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-ready-to-step-up-sikorski-says/	2024-11-19T05:21:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2158687722.jpg

Ukraine's parliament approves state budget for 2025	Ukraine&apos;s parliament has approved the country&apos;s state budget for 2025, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Nov. 19. &quot;All taxes of citizens and businesses next year will be directed to the defense and security of our country,&quot; he said in a post on Telegram. &quot;In conditions of limited resources, this budget clearly defines priorities. Defense, security, support of people, development and restoration of the country. These are all things that make us stronger and lead to victory.&quot; The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the draft state budget for 2025 on Sept. 13. The state expects to get Hr 2 trillion ($48.2 billion) in revenues, while expenditures are planned at Hr 3.6 trillion ($86.8 billion). The budget for 2025 envisages spending Hr 2.2 trillion ($53 billion) on Ukraine&apos;s defense, which is 26.3% of the country&apos;s projected gross domestic product (GDP). On Nov. 12, Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin said the budget envisages Hr 55 billion ($1.3 billion) for weapons production. Ukraine began actively developing its defense production after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Some Hr 54.55 billion ($1.3 billion) will be directly allocated for the development and implementation of new technologies, and the expansion of defense production capacity, according to Smetanin. The minister added that the 2025 figure is almost Hr 3.5 billion ($84.4 million) more than in 2024.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-parliament-approves-state-budget-for-2025/	2024-11-19T05:02:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2178721575.jpg
Over 50,000 Ukrainian recruits have received training in UK	More than 50,000 Ukrainian recruits have undergone training in the U.K. as part of the British-led Operation Interflex since June 2022, the U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 19. &quot;Kosovo, Romania, and Estonia are the latest nations to join this global effort, standing united for freedom and resilience,&quot; the Defense Ministry said on X. The project, also supported by 10 other partner countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Australia, provides essential military training to Ukrainian recruits at various facilities. Operation Interflex, led by the U.K., is one of the key programs aimed at preparing Ukrainian troops to defend against Russian aggression. Ukrainian service members have also been receiving military training under other initiatives led either by national governments of partner countries or the EU. British soldiers have been warned that Russia may be using spies and drones to gather intelligence on Ukrainian service members trained in the U.K., according to a report by The Times on Aug. 5.	https://kyivindependent.com/over-50-000-ukrainian-recruits-receive-training-in-uk/	2024-11-19T04:49:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1635574120.jpg
Better late than never: Israeli companies finally reach out to Ukraine to help fight Iranian drones	Editor&#x2019;s note: This article was originally published in the Israeli investigative outlet Shomrim. The Kyiv Independent is republishing it with permission. After Israeli officials earlier ignored Ukrainian warnings and offers to help counter the threat of Iranian drones, the tides appear to be turning as Israel faces increased drone attacks amid escalating tensions in the region. After talking with dozens of officials and key individuals in the defense technology sector, Israeli investigative outlet Shomrim has found that contacts and early signs of collaboration are emerging in this field. Israeli defense tech companies are seeking proven solutions that have been tested in real combat situations. Shomrim and N12 revealed earlier this year that long before the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Ukrainian officials had reached out to their counterparts in Israel to share their experience countering the threat of Iranian-made drones since Russia began using the weapon against Ukraine in 2022. A former senior Ukrainian official said that at least one Ukrainian company developing anti-drone technology sent representatives to Israel before the outbreak of the war in Gaza &#x2014; but could not find a single counterpart from the defense sector in Israel willing to meet with them. &#x201C;Not a single company agreed to meet with them at their office,&#x201D; said the former official, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations. &#x201C;Someone did agree to meet with them at a fast-food restaurant and I believe that was the only meeting. It was a humiliating experience.&#x201D; Both current and former Israeli and Ukrainian officials said that Israel paid a heavy price for dismissing those warnings. The Iranian-made drones that are being launched at Israel from Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Iran itself have led to casualties, destruction, fires, and panic and are now the main challenge currently facing Israel&#x2019;s aerial defense systems. The extent of the threat was underscored by the drone that hit and damaged the private residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Caesarea. The Ukrainian companies, for their part, are hoping to grow and profit from the Israeli companies&#x2019; international contacts. Ukraine gained experience from almost three years of war, with over 7,000 drones launched from Russia into Ukraine since the beginning of 2024, including about 2,000 in October alone.

(Sergey Bobok / AFP via Getty Images)For comparison, the Israeli army recently reported that since Oct. 7, 2023, about 1,300 drones have been launched against Israel from all fronts combined: Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Iran. The war against Russia, together with large investments from both the private and public sectors, has turned Ukraine into a hotbed of global innovation when it comes to the defense tech sector, with a proliferation of companies offering groundbreaking solutions to identify and intercept drones. The industry has attracted the attention of Western nations, including private companies. Some firms have opened business offices in Ukraine, while others have forged close ties with Ukrainian companies. Russia&#x2019;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to an exponential and fast-paced development of the Ukrainian defense industry, said Olena Bilousova, a senior researcher at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). When Ukraine first started dealing with the challenge posed by drones from Russia, it set up a dedicated national industry, spearheaded by its Digital Transformation Ministry, to find a solution. There are now more than 200 Ukrainian companies working in the field. &#x201C;As far as military companies are concerned, there is nowhere in the world like Ukraine, since it offers them an opportunity to test their products on the battlefield against an enemy as mighty as Russia, which also has advanced technologies,&#x201D; said Bilousova. Zvook, a ground-breaking Ukrainian start-up in the field of AI-powered acoustic detection of incoming drones, missiles, and other aerial threats, is among the companies establishing ties with Israeli partners. Maryan Sulym, head of Zvook and a Ukrainian military air defense sergeant, said that his company relies on small acoustic sensors the size of a small box placed on cellphone towers and in hidden locations along the front line. Each sensor can detect Iranian Shahed drones within a range of three to five kilometers and cruise missiles within five to seven kilometers. Today, Sulym said, Zvook&#x2019;s network covers about 5% of the territory of Ukraine &#x2014; an area larger than the whole of Israel. The data collected from the sensors is impressively accurate, with false positive rates of only 2.5%. According to Sergeant Sulym, Zvook&#x2019;s innovative approach has attracted attention from international actors, including NATO countries. U.S. Air Force General James Hecker, commander of U.S. air operations in Europe, recently commended Ukraine&apos;s acoustic detection systems, highlighting how these low-cost devices &#x2014; about a thousand dollars per sensor &#x2014; can accurately gauge the speed, direction, and velocity of incoming drones. Zvook has also attracted interest in Israel and has been approached by at least three Israeli defense technology firms. One of the inquiries was made in recent weeks, shortly after a drone crashed into the Israeli Prime Minister&apos;s residence. Representatives of this Israeli company are set to visit Ukraine in the near future, in order to closely examine Zvook&#x2019;s acoustic technology. Another meeting was held last month online, between a Ukrainian company specializing in first-person-view drones and robotics and a group of Israeli entrepreneurs in the security field. It is not yet known whether the meeting will lead to actual contracts, but one of the participants in the call said that there was a definite interest in the transfer of knowledge and that the Israelis asked the Ukrainian entrepreneur numerous questions concerning, among other things, Ukrainian efforts to intercept Iranian Shahed drones, according to the paricipant, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the call. Vladimir Davidoff, founder and CEO of Dronex Israel, which manufactures reusable interceptor drones, cautions that the technologies developed by Ukrainian companies are not necessarily suitable for Israel&apos;s needs. &#x201C;In Ukraine, response time from detection to action can be hours, whereas here in Israel, we have minutes or even seconds,&#x201D; he said, due to the vast size difference between the two countries. The Ukrainian experience can still prove meaningful, according to Davidoff. The lack of direct encounters with drones in real combat situations has proven detrimental to the Israeli Defense Force&#x2019;s readiness against drones, Davidoff said. &#x201C;You can only be certain your system works after it is tested in real combat conditions,&quot; said Davidoff. &quot;In Israel, our expectations (about how well it was protected from drones) were somewhat inflated, and we need more solutions specifically tailored to the complexities of drone threats.&#x201D; Davidoff is well acquainted with the war zones in both Israel and Ukraine. He worked in Ukraine after the start of the Russian full-scale invasion and redirected his company&apos;s activities to the defense sector.

(Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)One of his companies, which operates in Europe, recently concluded an agreement and bought samples from a Ukrainian manufacturer of acoustic sensors that operates from another nearby country in Europe. He did not name the country, citing security concerns. &quot;If the sensors pass tests in Israel, we can produce them together in Israel,&quot; he said, in an example of direct cooperation between Ukrainian and Israeli defense companies. The cooperation between Davidoff&#x2019;s firm and his Ukrainian counterpart illustrates a type of circumvention that Ukrainian companies are currently employing given Ukraine&apos;s ban on military exports since the outbreak of the war. Ukraine adopted this ban to ensure that all available Ukrainian weaponry would be used against the Russian invasion. According to Bilousova of KSE, more and more Ukrainian companies are already circumventing the export ban by transferring production to other countries and opening their headquarters in countries close to Ukraine, such as Poland and Estonia. The Ukrainian government has recently indicated that it may be willing to overturn the ban and allow arms exports, including anti-drone systems. This could pave the way for broader cooperation between Ukrainian companies and Israel. Yevhen Korniychuk, Ukraine&#x2019;s ambassador in Israel, confirmed the ongoing cooperation between Israel and Ukrainian companies but declined to go into details, citing the sensitivity of the subject. &#x201C;Israeli private companies and state defense firms are quite actively communicating with their Ukrainian counterparts right now,&#x201D; he said. In this context, Elbit, one of Israel&#x2019;s largest military companies, was mentioned by Korniychuk. Ukraine&#x2019;s ambassador helped introduce Elbit representatives to officials from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Another Israeli company is R2, which has developed a product for identifying and locating drones and is taking part in exercises with NATO. R2 is currently in touch with Brave1, a Ukrainian government platform whose purpose is to test and develop advanced military technology. Western governments usually tend to encourage and support such collaborations between private defense companies in their countries and Brave1, but the CEO of the Israeli company noted that the connection to the Ukrainian platform has been made independently and without the involvement of the IDF or the Defense Ministry. The Ukrainian ambassador describes the cooperation between Ukrainian and Israeli firms as a force multiplier, emphasizing that this synergy should have been initiated long ago. &#x201C;One plus one&#x2014;Israel plus Ukraine&#x2014;equals three or four, not two. Israel brings technological knowledge as well as access to American technologies. We have vast combat experience. We need to combine all of that, of course. This cooperation should have taken place long ago,&#x201D; the ambassador said.	https://kyivindependent.com/better-late-than-never-israeli-companies-finally-reach-out-to-ukraine-to-help-fight-iranian-drones/	2024-11-19T04:49:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1682387939.jpg
Ukraine used ATACMS on Russian territory for first time, according to Moscow, media	The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Nov. 19 that Ukraine launched U.S.-made ATACMS missiles against Russia&apos;s Bryansk Oblast, according to the state news agency TASS. This coincides with several Ukrainian media outlets reporting that, according to undisclosed military sources, Ukraine successfully struck a Russian military facility in Karachev, Bryansk Oblast. If confirmed, this would mark the first instance of Ukraine using U.S.-made long-range missiles on Russian territory since Washington eased the restrictions last week. Kyiv&apos;s forces have previously deployed the weaponry only against Russian targets in occupied Ukrainian territories. The claims could not be independently verified. A Ukrainian military representative declined to comment on the reports for the Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian officials previously reported an attack with unspecified weaponry against a Russian arsenal in Karachev overnight on Nov. 19, which reportedly stored artillery ammunition, including North Korean munitions, KAB guided bombs, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launcher ammunition. Twelve secondary explosions could be heard at around 2:30 a.m., the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. Karachev residents reported explosions and detonations, including an alleged attack on a &quot;military base,&quot; as shared in local chats and reported by Russian media outlet Astra. The town lies more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Ukrainian border. ATACMS missiles have a maximum range of 300 kilometers (190 miles). In turn, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that its forces shot down five and damaged one ATACMS missile. Missile fragments fell on a military facility in Bryansk Oblast and started a fire but inflicted &quot;no casualties or damage,&quot; the ministry claimed. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision earlier this week, said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. Commenting on the reports, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the &quot;missiles will speak for themselves.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-media-claim-ukraine-used-atacms-in-russia-for-first-time/	2024-11-19T04:24:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1430567925.jpg
Russia's FSB reports detentions over Crimea car bombing	Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service (FSB) on Nov. 19 announced the detention of two residents of Russian-occupied Crimea in connection with a car bombing in Sevastopol on Nov. 13 that killed Russian Navy officer Valery Trankovsky. A source from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent at the time that Trankovsky was responsible for missile strikes against Ukrainian cities and his killing was a result of an SBU operation. According to the FSB, a 38-year-old resident of Sevastopol tracked Trankovsky&#x2019;s car, while a 47-year-old resident of Yalta reportedly constructed and placed an improvised explosive device under the vehicle. Authorities claimed to have found 1.2 kilograms of explosives, equivalent to TNT, in the 47-year-old suspect&apos;s garage. Trankovsky was chief of staff of the 41st Missile Boat Brigade and a &quot;war criminal who has ordered cruise missile launches from the Black Sea against civilian sites in Ukraine,&quot; the source said. The officer was allegedly responsible for the Kalibr missile strike against the city of Vinnytsia in July 2022 that killed 29 people and injured over 200 more. He also oversaw strikes against Odesa and other cities, leaving many civilians dead, the source said. This incident is part of a broader pattern of Russian military officers involved in the war against Ukraine being killed in Russia or Russian-occupied territories.	https://kyivindependent.com/russias-fsb-reports-detentions-over-crimea-car-bombing/	2024-11-19T04:03:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Baza-2.jpg
Ukraine aims to produce 30,000 long-range drones, 3,000 missiles, Zelensky says	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Nov. 19 that Ukraine plans to increase the production of long-range drones and missiles as part of the country&apos;s resilience plan. In a speech to the parliament, Zelensky said that the drones would help compensate for the army&#x2019;s lack of artillery. Ukraine aims to produce at least 30,000 long-range drones next year, and a new technology center will be established. The president also set the task of producing 3,000 cruise missiles and drone-missile hybrids and finding an effective countermeasure to Russian Shahed-type drones. The statement follows an earlier announcement on Oct. 21, when Zelensky revealed that the U.S. is preparing to allocate an aid package worth $700-800 million to support Ukraine&#x2019;s domestic production of long-range capabilities. In addition to drones, Ukraine is advancing its missile development. Zelensky previously said that the country successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic missile. Zelensky has also revealed that Ukraine had developed another domestic-made weapon, a missile-drone Palianytsia. He said it has already been used against Russia. The first successful use of the Palianytsia missile was confirmed by Zelensky during his Independence Day speech on Aug. 24. Ukraine has been developing its own long-range capabilities in lieu of Western long-range arms, the use of which has been restricted by Kyiv&apos;s international partners. Only last week did Washington allow the use of ATACMS missiles on Russian soil, marking a significant policy shift.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-missiles-drones/	2024-11-19T03:37:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2177157663.jpg
Russian attack against Kharkiv injures 3	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched an attack against the Kyivskyi district of Kharkiv on Nov. 19, injuring three people, Mayor Ihor Terekhov reported.

Long-range strikes can help push Russia toward peace, US official says	U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Brian A. Nichols indirectly acknowledged on Nov. 18 that U.S. President Joe Biden had authorized Ukraine to use American weapons to strike Russian territory. &quot;The weapons President Biden authorized Ukraine to use will give it more capabilities to defend itself and, hopefully, make the Russian Federation understand that using force to seize Ukrainian territory will not succeed,&quot; Nichols said in an interview with the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, responding to a question about Biden easing restrictions. His comments followed reports saying Biden had authorized Ukraine to use American-supplied ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia, marking a notable shift in U.S. policy. Officials in Kyiv and Washington have been largely evasive when asked about the reports. Nichols reiterated that the war could end immediately if Russia withdrew its forces and respected Ukraine&apos;s borders, calling Moscow&#x2019;s invasion &quot;unprovoked.&quot; &quot;The war began with Russia&#x2019;s new unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The conflict in Ukraine could end right now if Russia withdrew its troops from Ukraine and respected Ukraine&#x2019;s borders,&quot; Nichols said. The EU&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Nov. 18 that Washington had &quot;authorized the use of its weapons up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) inside Russian territory.&quot; This distance coincides with the estimated range of ATACMS missiles. Unnamed U.S. officials and a source familiar with the decision told Reuters that Ukraine plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days without providing operational details. Another source confirmed to Axios that the strikes are limited to Kursk Oblast and that the decision was communicated to Kyiv three days earlier, Axios reported on Nov. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/long-range-strikes-can-help-push-russia-toward-peace-us-official-says/	2024-11-19T03:12:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1494251875.jpg
Russia claims to capture village near Kurakhove, Kyiv hasn't confirmed	Russian forces claim to have taken the front-line village of Novoselydivka in Donetsk Oblast on Nov. 19. Ukraine has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified. Novoselydivka lies some 7 kilometers (4 miles) north of Kurakhove, an important stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the area that has seen increasingly heavy Russian assaults in the past months. If confirmed, this will be the latest village that the Russian forces took in their attempt to encircle Kurakhove by driving their forces towards Konstiantynopil with a north-south pincer movement. The estimated Russian advance in Novoselydivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Nov. 18, 2024, according to the DeepState monitoring service (DeepState/OpenStreetMaps)With the best Ukrainian brigades holding Russia&#x2019;s Kursk Oblast, Russian troops move forward along the Donetsk front line at a rate not seen since the early weeks of the war. The victory of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in early November adds further uncertainty to Kyiv&#x2019;s military prospects to hold its defenses across the 1,200-kilometer-long (750 miles) front line as doubt over Washington&#x2019;s future military aid looms. Outgoing President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to use Western-supplied ATACMS to strike targets deep inside Russia may help in the short run but will not change the general course of the war, observers said.	https://kyivindependent.com/novoselydivka/	2024-11-19T02:54:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2176747572.jpg
Severed internet cables raise suspicion of sabotage in Baltic Sea	Telecom cables linking two Nordic countries with Germany and Lithuania were cut on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, raising suspicion of sabotage, various media outlets reported on Nov. 18. While the circumstances of the incident remain unclear, the reports come amid mounting warnings of Russian hybrid and sabotage operations across Western countries, namely in the Baltic Sea region. One of the cables, a 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) long one linking Helsinki with the German port of Rostock, stopped working on Nov. 18, while the shorter, a 218-kilometer-long (135 miles) link between Lithuania and Sweden&#x2019;s Gotland Island, went out of service on Nov. 17, The Guardian reported. Gotland, Sweden&apos;s largest island, is located about 330 kilometers (around 200 miles) north of the Russian exclave Kaliningrad, the headquarters of Russia&apos;s Baltic Fleet, and is strategically important for the defense of the Baltic Sea region. &quot;We are deeply concerned about the severed undersea cable connecting Finland and Germany in the Baltic Sea. The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage,&quot; a joint statement by Germany and Finland read. The parties announced an investigation. &quot;Our European security is not only under threat from Russia&apos;s war of aggression against Ukraine but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors,&quot; the statement added. This incident comes a little more than two years after unknown actors blew up the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines.	https://kyivindependent.com/severed-internet-cables-raise-suspicion-of-sabotage-in-baltic-sea/	2024-11-19T02:32:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182217094--1-.jpg
Zelensky presents Ukraine's resilience plan to parliament	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. President Volodymyr Zelensky unveiled Ukraine&apos;s 10-point plan for internal resilience in an address to the parliament on Nov. 19. The individual points were focused on the country&apos;s unity, front-line situation, arms, finances, energy, security, communities, human capital, cultural sovereignty, and veterans, lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said on his Telegram channel.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-presents-ukraines-resilience-plan-to-parliament/	2024-11-19T01:58:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/29feee4480122502cb728f1cc8bdac91_1659015958_extra_large.jpeg
Duda accuses Scholz of sidelining Trump in Ukraine peace efforts	Polish President Andrzej Duda accused German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Nov. 18 of undermining U.S. President-elect Donald Trump&#x2019;s potential role in Ukraine peace negotiations to rebuild Germany&#x2019;s ties with Russia. Duda suggested that Scholz&#x2019;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin was an attempt to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine before Trump takes office. &quot;I believe it was an attempt to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine before Donald Trump took office,&quot; Duda said in an interview in Warsaw, as quoted by Bloomberg. Scholz defended the call as an effort to encourage peace talks with Ukraine, but it drew criticism from Kyiv and its allies. The Polish president has traditionally fostered warm ties with Trump, who pledged to end the war &quot;within 24&quot; hours and bring both sides to the negotiating table. Duda sought to dispel concerns about Trump abandoning Ukraine, saying the U.S. president-elect &quot;does not like to lose.&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Nov. 15 against negotiations that might ease Russia&apos;s isolation without achieving meaningful results. &quot;It is extremely important for Putin to loosen his isolation, Russia&apos;s isolation, and to conduct ordinary negotiations that will not result in anything &#x2014; as he has been doing for decades,&quot; Zelensky said. Earlier, Trump announced that he may &quot;soon&quot; appoint a Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on ending Russia&apos;s war, Fox News reported on Nov. 13. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Belarus and Turkey in early 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukraine retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas.	https://kyivindependent.com/duda-scholz-trump/	2024-11-19T01:50:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1251957530.jpg
Russian attacks against Ukraine kill 25, injure 79 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 25 people and injured at least 79 over the past day, with children and police officers among the casualties, regional authorities reported on Nov. 19. Russian forces launched a ballistic missile attack against the port city of Odesa on Nov. 18, killing at least 10 people and injuring 55. &#x200B;&#x200B;The fatalities included seven police officers, a medic, and two civilian residents. Among the injured were at least 14 law enforcement officers and four children, two of them aged 7, 10, and two 11-year-olds. A Russian drone attack in Sumy Oblast late on Nov. 18 killed at least 10 people, including a child, and injured at least 13 people, including three children, the State Emergency Service reported on Nov. 19. The drone attack struck a dormitory building of an educational institution in the town of Hlukhiv at around 11:20 p.m. local time, authorities said. More people may remain trapped under the rubble. In Kharkiv Oblast&#x2019;s Hoptivka village, Russian attacks injured a 52-year-old man and a 59-year-old woman, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported on his Telegram channel. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed three people and injured seven, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on his Telegram channel. In Kherson Oblast, dozens of villages and the city of Kherson came under attack, as a result of which two people were killed and two were injured, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Russia launched at least 87 drones overnight, of which Ukrainian air defenses shot down 51 across nine regions, the Air Force said. Thirty drones were lost across Ukraine thanks to active countermeasures, the statement read.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-6/	2024-11-19T01:35:33-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Odesa-Nov-18.jpg
Putin approves Russia's updated nuclear doctrine	Russian President Vladimir Putin approved updated principles of Russia&apos;s nuclear deterrence policy, according to a presidential decree published on a government website on Nov. 19. The revised doctrine outlines scenarios that could justify a nuclear strike. It implies that this could include &quot;aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear state with the support of a nuclear state&quot; and large-scale non-nuclear attacks, such as those carried out with drones. Putin first proposed changes to the nuclear doctrine during a Sept. 25 Security Council meeting on nuclear deterrence. He claimed that Russia does not need a preventative strike as part of its nuclear doctrine &quot;because, in a retaliatory strike, the enemy will be guaranteed to be destroyed.&quot; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the changes should be seen as a &quot;certain signal&quot; to the West. &quot;This is a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they take part in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear,&quot; Peskov told the state-run RIA Novosti on Sept. 26. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal.	https://kyivindependent.com/putin-approves-russias-updated-nuclear-doctrine/	2024-11-19T00:41:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2151313411.jpg
West marks 1,000 days of Russia’s full-scale war with solidarity with Ukraine	Western leaders, officials, and diplomats expressed support for Ukraine on Nov. 19, the 1,000 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. On Feb. 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, extending its aggression beyond the partially occupied Donbas region and Crimea in an attempt to seize the entire country. Ukraine on Nov. 19 marked 1,000 days of full-scale war with Russia. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that EU buildings were illuminated with Ukrainian flags in tribute to the country&apos;s defenders. &quot;In 2022, Russia thought its full-scale invasion would end in days. 1,000 days later, Ukraine bravely resists. On the battlefield. And against criminal attacks on civilian targets. Tonight our buildings adorn the Ukrainian flag to honor the brave men and women of Ukraine,&quot; von der Leyen wrote on X. Patrick Turner, NATO&apos;s senior representative in Ukraine, praised Ukraine&apos;s resilience, calling it a powerful inspiration for the world. &quot;NATO remains by your side, today and every day,&quot; Turner said. Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas highlighted Ukraine&#x2019;s steadfastness and reiterated Lithuania&#x2019;s continued support. &quot;Ukraine can always count on us. Together, we will celebrate victory,&quot; he said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced plans for new defense assistance for Ukraine &quot;in the coming days,&quot; calling on U.N. member states to back Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&apos;s peace formula. &quot;Until then, and at the direction of the President, the United States will continue to surge security assistance to Ukraine, including artillery, air defense, armored vehicles, and other needed capabilities and munitions. And we will announce additional security assistance for Ukraine in the days to come,&quot; the ambassador said.	https://kyivindependent.com/west-marks-1-000-days-of-russias-full-scale-war-with-solidarity-with-ukraine/	2024-11-19T00:27:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Europe.jpg
Ukraine strikes Russian ammunition depot in Bryansk Oblast, military says	Ukrainian forces struck an arsenal of a Russian logistics center in the town of Karachev in Bryansk Oblast overnight on Nov. 19, the General Staff of Ukraine&apos;s Armed Forces reported. The announcement comes shortly after Russian authorities reported drone strikes against the border region, claiming there has been no damage or casualties. Twelve drones were destroyed over the territory of Bryansk Oblast by Russian air defenses on Nov. 19, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed. Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz said the attack caused no casualties or significant damage. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports. Karachev residents reported explosions and detonations, including an alleged attack on a &quot;military base,&quot; as shared in local chats and reported by Russian media outlet Astra. Twelve secondary explosions could be heard at around 2:30 a.m., the General Staff reported. &quot;The destruction of Russian ammunition warehouses in order to stop Russian aggression against Ukraine will continue,&quot; the military said in a statement. Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine&apos;s counter-disinformation center at the National Security and Defense Council, claimed the attack targeted the 67th arsenal of Russia&apos;s Main Missile and Artillery Directorate. The official said the facility stored artillery ammunition, including North Korean munitions, KAB guided bombs, anti-aircraft missiles, and rocket launcher ammunition. Russia attacked Ukraine&#x2019;s northeastern Sumy Oblast on Nov. 18, which borders Bryansk Oblast, killing at least seven people, including a child, and injuring 12 others. Ukrainian forces have frequently targeted Russian border regions to diminish Russian attacks within Ukraine&apos;s borders.	https://kyivindependent.com/bryansk-oblast-arsenal/	2024-11-18T23:31:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2150742300.jpg
Georgian police disperse protesters in Tbilisi	Georgian police dispersed a protest in Tbilisi demanding new elections on the eve of Nov. 18, but organizers promised a quick resumption elsewhere. The protests came as part of the pro-EU opposition&#x2019;s refusal to recognize the electoral victory claimed by the ruling Georgian Dream party, which has close ties to Russia. The disputed results have triggered large-scale protests in Tbilisi. &quot;We will liberate this country from them without using force. This is Georgia, this is Europe, this is not Russia. How long should we educate freedom-loving people? It will never end, it has not ended for thousands of years, and it will not end even now,&quot; Nika Melia, one of the opposition leaders, was quoted as saying by News Georgia. Protesters occupied a busy junction of downtown Tbilisi on Nov. 17 with tents, but the police dispersed them a day later, citing an insufficient number of protesters. &quot;A representative of the Interior Ministry previously warned the political leaders about the planned measures. He urged them to leave the territory, justifying the demand by the fact that there were not enough demonstrators to block the road,&quot; Georgia&#x2019;s Interior Ministry was quoted as saying by Interfax Ukraine in a statement. Official election results showed Georgian Dream securing nearly 54% of the vote, but opposition leaders and international observers have highlighted widespread allegations of intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and vote-buying. Georgian Dream has faced accusations of democratic backsliding and steering the South Caucasus country closer to the Kremlin. Earlier this year, the controversial &quot;foreign agents&quot; law sparked mass protests and violent crackdowns by police. Following the election, the European Commission announced the suspension of Georgia&#x2019;s EU accession process, highlighting the growing rift between Tbilisi and the West.	https://kyivindependent.com/georgian-police-disperse-protesters-in-tbilisi/	2024-11-18T23:15:05-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181587481.jpg
Macron praises Biden's decision to ease limits on Ukraine's long-range strikes	French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike targets in Russia with long-range American missiles, calling it &quot;a good decision&quot; on Nov. 18. Macron said the move was a response to Russia escalating the war by deploying North Korean soldiers. &quot;Russia is the only power that made an escalatory decision ... it&apos;s really this break that led to the U.S. decision,&quot; Macron said, as reported by Politico on Nov. 19. Media reports on Nov. 17 suggested that President Biden allowed Ukraine to use ATACMS missiles against military targets in Russia, focusing on Russian and North Korean forces in Kursk Oblast. The EU&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, confirmed on Nov. 18 that the &quot;Biden administration had authorized the use of its weapons up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) inside Russian territory.&quot; Earlier this year, Macron backed Ukraine&#x2019;s right to strike military targets in Russia, saying Moscow was taking advantage of Western missile restrictions. France has previously supplied Ukraine with its SCALP/T missiles, which have been deployed against Russian targets in occupied territories. Ukraine has repeatedly urged Western allies for long-range missiles and approval to target Russia, a crucial part of President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x2019;s five-point victory plan. Biden&#x2019;s decision comes just weeks before leaving office. President-elect Donald Trump will take over on Jan. 20, 2025, possibly overturning years of U.S. policy on Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/macron-praises-biden/	2024-11-18T22:59:44-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2033880055.jpg

Ukraine marks 1000 days of full-scale war	Ukraine on Nov. 19 marked 1,000 days of full-scale war with Russia. Russian forces launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, extending their aggression beyond the occupied Donbas region in an attempt to bring the entire country under Moscow&apos;s control. &quot;For 1,000 days, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been confronting the enemy on the front line, which stretches over 1,000 kilometers,&quot; Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Nov. 19. &quot;In the frozen trenches of Donetsk Oblast and in the burning steppes of Kherson Oblast under shells, hail, and anti-aircraft guns, we are fighting for the right to life. For us and our children.&quot; The milestone comes as Ukraine braces for a difficult and uncertain winter. Russia on Nov. 17 launched one of its largest aerial attacks yet against Ukraine&apos;s energy grid, leaving civilians dead and injured across multiple regions. The future of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is also in question, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January. Meanwhile, thousands of Russian and North Korean forces have amassed in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, preparing to launch a counteroffensive against Ukrainian troops. The escalating situation in Kursk reportedly prompted U.S. President Joe Biden to grant Ukraine permission to use American long-range weapons on Russian territory. &quot;Every dark night, even if there are a thousand of them, always ends with dawn,&quot; Syrskyi said.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-marks-1000-days-war/	2024-11-18T21:59:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184805574.jpg
Russian attack on Sumy Oblast kills 6, injures 12, including children	Editor&apos;s Note: This is a developing story. A Russian drone attack in Sumy Oblast on Nov. 18 killed at least six people, including a child, and injured at least 12 others, the regional military administration reported. The drone struck an apartment building in the town of Hlukhiv at around 11:20 p.m. local time, authorities said. Six people were killed in the attack, including one child, the administration reported. At least 12 others were injured, including two children, as of 7 a.m. on Nov. 19. Rescue workers are still searching for more people who may be buried beneath the rubble. Ukraine&apos;s northeastern Sumy Oblast borders Russia&apos;s Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts. Residents of the vulnerable border communities endure daily Russian attacks, prompting mass evacuations from the region. During Russia&apos;s large-scale aerial attack against Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17, the regional capital Sumy &#xA0;came under heavy fire, with Russia launching multiple missile strikes on the city. The attack targeted residential areas, killing 11 people, including two children.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attack-on-sumy-oblast/	2024-11-18T21:39:13-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/drone.jpg
Dutch FM welcomes US decision to allow long-range strikes against Russia	U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s reported decision to allow Kyiv to strike targets in Russia with long-range American missiles is a welcome step in support of Ukraine&apos;s defense, Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said on Nov. 18. Veldkamp only regrets that the decision was leaked to the media. &quot;I would have preferred it to be a surprise for the Russians,&quot; Veldkamp said, according to the Dutch news outlet NL Times. &#xA0; Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that Biden has granted permission for Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike military targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, the permissions extend only to Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The decision has not been publicly confirmed by Kyiv or Washington, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that the &quot;missiles will speak for themselves.&quot; Speaking on the sidelines of the EU foreign ministers&apos; meeting in Brussels, Veldkamp said he approved of Washington&apos;s change in policy. &quot;This is an adequate response to the North Korean troop presence on the Russian side,&quot; he said. Moving the war onto the aggressor state&apos;s territory is valid under international law, Veldkamp said. &quot;The Netherlands has repeatedly advocated that weapons that we supply to Ukraine can also be deployed on Russian territory. After all, that is the territory of the aggressor.&quot; Ukraine has long pressed Western partners for long-range missiles and the permission to use them on Russian soil. Long-range strikes are a key component of Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan for Ukraine. Biden&apos;s decision comes in the final weeks of his presidency, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to again take office on Jan. 20, 2025, potentially overturning years of U.S. policy on Ukraine. &#xA0;	https://kyivindependent.com/dutch-fm-welcomes-us-decision-to-allow-long-range-strikes-against-russia/	2024-11-18T20:41:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162501104.jpg
Ukrainian musician Khlyvnyuk rejects Magnitsky Award, declines to share honor with Navalnaya	Ukrainian musician Andriy Khlyvnyuk on Nov. 18 declined to accept the Magnitsky Human Rights Award due to the statements of his co-recipient, Yulia Navalnaya, regarding Western military aid to Ukraine. Khlyvnyuk, lead singer of the Ukrainian music group BoomBox, joined Ukraine&apos;s Territorial Defense Force after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in 2022 and now serves in the National Police. In a Facebook post published Nov. 18, Khlyvnyuk thanked the jurors of the Magnitsky Award, which honors journalists, activists, and politicians working to advance human rights. &quot;I sincerely thank all the founders and jury of the influential international Magnitsky Award in London,&quot; he said. &quot;You have noticed and noted my contribution to the race for freedom of speech and fundamental human rights, as part of the struggle for the independence of the Ukrainian state, which is insignificant compared to other people and foundations.&quot; Khlyvnyuk then explained that despite his gratitute, he could not accept the award, which was also offered to Russian opposition figure Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late dissident Alexei Navalny. &quot;(A)s the father of two children living under missile strikes and a private in the defense forces of Ukraine ... I cannot receive this award together with other laureates who are &apos;not sure&apos; of the need to provide my country with Western weapons, vitally necessary to repel Russian aggression,&quot; Khlyvnyuk said. Navalnaya said in an interview with the German outlet Zeit that she was not sure whether or not it was correct to supply arms to Ukraine. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to say,&quot; she said. &quot;The war was unleashed by Vladimir Putin, but the bombs are hitting Russians too.&quot; Following her husband&apos;s death in a Russian penal colony, Navalnaya has become a more visible leader in the Russian opposition movement. She received a 2024 Magnitsky Award under the category &quot;Courage Under Fire.&quot; Khlyvnyuk&apos;s statement comes a day after Russia on Nov. 17 unleashed one of its largest aerial attacks against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. The combined missile and drone attack targeted the country&apos;s energy grid and left multiple civilians dead or injured.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-musician-khlyvnyuk-rejects-magnitsky-award-declines-to-share-honor-with-navalnaya/	2024-11-18T19:53:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2162098256.jpg
President of Russian-occupied Abkhazia resigns amid protests	Aslan Bzhania, president of Georgia&apos;s Russian-occupied Abkhazia region, submitted a letter of resignation on Nov. 19 in an effort to make a deal with anti-government protesters. A controversial investment agreement with Russia sparked mass demonstrations in the regional capital city of Sukhum on Nov. 15, with demonstrators storming government buildings. The proposed law seeks to permit Russians to purchase property in Abkhazia. Abkhazia is internationally recognized as part of Georgia, but is under illegal Russian control. According to a resignation letter and announcement published by the Abkhaz president&apos;s press service, Bzhania&apos;s resignation will take effect once protesters withdraw and disperse from government property. If demonstrators do not comply, Bzhania said he would withdraw his resignation. The region&apos;s current vice president, Badra Gunba, is now acting president of Abkhazia, according to the announcement. Protesters in recent days began rallying outside the proxy parliament, denouncing the proposed law as one-sided and advantageous only to Russia. As demonstrations intensified, protesters reportedly threw eggs and bottles at police officers and used a car to breach part of the fence. The AMRA-Life Telegram channel also reported that Abkhaz opposition leader Levan Mykaa announced protesters would occupy the building until the president resigned.	https://kyivindependent.com/president-of-russian-occupied-abkhazia-resigns-amid-protests/	2024-11-18T19:00:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1718754754.jpg
Polish FM criticizes Hungary for supporting Russian aggression	Hungary is aiding Russian aggression by continuing to block military aid from the European Union, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on the sidelines of the EU foreign ministers&apos; meeting in Brussels on Nov. 18. Budapest has been blocking the disbursement of Kyiv-bound assistance under the European Peace Facility (EPF) for more than a year, causing frustration among other member states. &quot;I would like to understand the reasons why Hungary does not want to help Ukraine, which is fighting for freedom, and wants to assist the aggressor in this conflict,&quot; Sikorski told reporters. Sikorski and other ministers from EU member nations convened in Brussels on Nov. 18 to address developments in Russia&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine, including U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s recent reported decision to allow Kyiv to use long-range American missiles on Russian targets and the future of military aid to Ukraine following the election of Donald Trump. The ministers did not come to a solution on releasing EPF funds for Ukraine, Sikorski said. &quot;Unfortunately, I cannot tell you today that the European Peace Facility has been unblocked, because unfortunately it is still being vetoed by the Hungarian side, despite the fact that a mechanism has been created thanks to which Hungarian money would not have to go to help Ukraine.&quot; Sikorski said he appealed to members of Poland&apos;s Law and Justice party (PiS) to work with Hungary&apos;s ruling Fidesz party, with whom they share political ties, to convince Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to change his position on EPF funds for Ukraine. &quot;I hope that (Polish) President Andrzej Duda will be more influential towards his friend, as he calls him, Donald Trump, than PiS has been so far towards Viktor Orban,&quot; he said. The EPF has been a key tool for supporting Ukraine&apos;s defense capabilities since 2022 but was largely depleted earlier this year as member states disagreed on the best way to replenish it and unlock further cash for Ukraine. While the EU approved an additional 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) for Ukraine in the spring, Budapest has been blocking their disbursement. A reform proposed in October would make financial contributions voluntary, potentially bypassing Hungary&apos;s veto. France and Germany remain skeptical of the plan&apos;s effectiveness, according to media reports. Orban is considered the EU&apos;s most Kremlin-friendly leader and has repeatedly stalled EU aid for Ukraine while blocking sanctions against Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/polish-fm-criticizes-hungary-for-supporting-russian-aggression/	2024-11-18T17:59:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1241114232-1.jpg
EU widens sanctions on Iran for supporting Russia's war	The European Union expanded sanctions against Iran on Nov. 18 in response to Tehran&apos;s support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, according to the European Council. The council announced a &quot;transaction ban prohibiting any transaction with ports and locks that are owned, operated or controlled by listed individuals and entities or are used for the transfer of Iranian UAVs or missiles or related technology and components to Russia.&quot; The new measures also target the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and its director, Mohammad Reza Khiabani. Reuters reported, citing Iran&apos;s official IRNA News Agency, that Ali Akbar Safaei, Managing Director of Iran&apos;s Ports and Maritime Organization, rejected the sanctions as &quot;baseless. &quot; The EU also imposed sanctions on three Russian shipping companies&#x2014;MG Flot, VTS Broker, and Arapax&#x2014;for delivering Iranian weapons, including drone components, across the Caspian Sea to bolster Russian troops in Ukraine. Earlier on Oct. 14, the EU adopted sanctions against seven individuals and seven entities over Iran&apos;s missile and drone shipments to Russia. Brussels joined the U.S. and other Western powers that have slapped sanctions on Iran after it was revealed that Tehran supplied Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Moscow.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-widens-sanctions-on-iran-for-supporting-russias-war/	2024-11-18T15:22:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2178315304.jpg
UNESCO condemns recent Russian attack on historic center of Odesa	UNESCO has condemned Russia&apos;s overnight strikes on Odesa&apos;s historic center overnight on Nov. 15, which damaged numerous architectural monuments, according to a statement on its official website. As a result of the Russian attack overnight on Nov. 15, a 35-year-old was killed. The strike also injured 10 people, with eight of them hospitalized with injuries of varying severity. &quot;UNESCO condemns these strikes, which contravene international law, and expresses its support for the victims, the population, and the local authorities,&quot; reads the statement published on Nov. 18. The historical center of the southern city of Odesa was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in January 2023. &quot;Once again, UNESCO is calling for an end to all attacks on cultural property protected under widely ratified international standard-setting instruments.&quot; A UNESCO mission led by Chiara Dezzi Bardeschi, head of the UNESCO Office in Ukraine, arrived on Nov. 16 to inspect the recently damaged cultural heritage sites. The organization has not yet provided the results of the assessments. Since the beginning of the all-out war, Russia has destroyed over 1,000 cultural heritage sites in Ukraine, including those under the protection of UNESCO, according to the Culture Ministry. In July 2023, the Russian missile strike damaged more than 20 architectural monuments in the historical center of Odesa and heavily damaged the Transfiguration Cathedral. On Oct. 28, &#xA0;the Russian bomb hit an iconic 13-story building situated in the very heart of Kharkiv, known as Derzhprom, or the State Industry House. Derzhprom was added to UNESCO&apos;s preliminary list in 2017 and was placed under provisional enhanced UNESCO protection after Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. As of Oct. 21, UNESCO confirmed the damage to 457 sites, including 143 religious sites, 231 buildings of historical or artistic interest, 32 museums, 33 monuments, 17 libraries, and one archive.	https://kyivindependent.com/unesco-condemns-russian-recent-attack-on-historic-center-of-odesa/	2024-11-18T13:45:10-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/odesa2.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia hits residential area in Odesa, kills 10, injures 55	Key developments on Nov. 18: Russian forces launched a ballistic missile attack against the port city of Odesa on Nov. 18, killing at least 10 people and injuring 55. The killed included seven police officers, a medic, and two civilian residents. Among the injured were at least 14 law enforcement officers and four children, two of them aged 7, 10, and two 11-year-olds. The children are hospitalized and are in condition of moderate severity, Governor Oleh Kiper said. Thirty other people are hospitalized, of which three are in critical condition. Local authorities declared Nov. 19 a day of mourning in Odesa, Kiper said. The aftermath of a Russian missile attack against Odesa, Ukraine, on Nov. 18, 2024. (State Emergency Service/Telegram)The aftermath of a Russian missile attack against Odesa, Ukraine, on Nov. 18, 2024. (State Emergency Service/Telegram)&quot;After calls and meetings with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, after false media gossip about &apos;refraining&apos; from strikes, Russia shows what it is really interested in: only war,&quot; Zelensky said. The attack occurred shortly after Russia launched one of its largest mass strikes against Ukraine on Nov. 17 and deadly missile attacks against the city of Sumy overnight on Nov. 18. Odesa, lying on the Black Sea coast in southern Ukraine, is home to some 1 million residents. The port city has been repeatedly targeted throughout the full-scale war. The outgoing U.S. administration intends to provoke an escalation of the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media on Nov. 18 following reports that Washington eased restrictions on long-range strikes. Peskov&apos;s words come as a Russian missile attack on Odesa hit a residential area, killing 10, and injuring 55 more. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;You know, with the reports in Western media, it is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps... to add fuel to the fire and continue to provoke further escalation of tensions,&quot; Peskov said in response to a question whether the Kremlin can confirm that Washington took the step, RIA Novosti reported. The statement comes as Biden is set to leave office in January, with Donald Trump replacing him in the Oval Office. The Biden administration has pledged to deliver as much support to Ukraine as possible before Trump takes office. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is not planning to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles despite the U.S. easing restrictions on long-range strikes, a government spokesperson told the AFP news agency on Nov. 18. Scholz has &quot;made his position clear&quot; on the matter and will &quot;not change his stance anymore,&quot; spokesperson Wolfgang Buchner said. Ukraine has previously received U.S.-made ATACMS and Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles from the U.K. and France, with a range of 300 kilometers (190 miles) and 250 kilometers (150 miles), respectively. In contrast, Scholz has been adamant about not supplying the Taurus cruise missiles, which boast a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles), fearing an escalation with Russia. Berlin&apos;s policy may soon shift as Germany heads toward snap elections on Feb. 23, with the center-right opposition alliance CDU/CSU currently leading the polls and threatening to oust Scholz. CDU/CSU&apos;s chancellor candidate, Friedrich Merz, said he would allow the delivery of Taurus missiles, but only if necessary after issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin and lifting restrictions on arms that had already been provided. Similarly, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who is running for the chancellery for the Greens, said he would greenlight the delivery of the missiles if elected in February. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will propose his peace plan for Ukraine during the G20 talks commencing on Nov. 18, Bloomberg reported, citing undisclosed sources. Erdogan&apos;s proposal would include Ukraine foregoing joining NATO for at least 10 years, freezing the current front line, providing Ukraine with weapons, and deploying international troops to a demilitarized buffer zone in the Donbas, Bloomberg reported. The Turkish leader&apos;s proposal comes as NATO countries prepare for a Donald Trump presidency, which many fear will lead to the U.S. pressuring Ukraine to end the war quickly, even at the cost of territorial concessions. The G20 countries are set to convene in Brazil without the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brazil is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin last year for the abduction of Ukrainian children. &#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky will also not be present, despite numerous appeals to receive an invitation.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky said on Nov. 16 that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky&apos;s words followed Scholz&#x2019;s phone conversation with Putin, during which he condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and called to withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &quot;just and lasting peace.&quot; The call sparked anger in Ukraine, with Zelensky saying it could open a &quot;Pandora&apos;s Box&quot; for further engagement with the Russian leader. In the wake of Trump&apos;s election, Kyiv has urged its partners to adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach to pressure Russia toward a just peace. President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, currently lying some 6-7 kilometers from the front line, his Telegram channel reported on Nov. 18. Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in the east, has come into artillery and drone range of Russian forces moving relentlessly forward in Donetsk Oblast. With Moscow&apos;s troops drawing near, losing the town would be a serious blow to other parts of the front line&apos;s defense as well. &quot;A tense sector. It is only thanks to the strength of the soldiers that the east (of Ukraine) is not completely occupied by Russia. The enemy receives a response every day,&quot; &#xA0;Zelensky said. The head of state also visited the base of the 25th Airborne Brigade and handed out awards to soldiers. During his trip, Zelensky was accompanied by Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin, who called Pokrovsk &quot;one of the hottest spots&quot; of the front line. Zelensky has previously visited the most critical sectors of the front line during the full-scale war, including now Russian-occupied Bakhmut or Avdiivka. His visit aims to boost the morale among Ukrainian troops, who are increasingly on the back foot in the face of a Russian advance. The inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in January adds further uncertainty regarding the future of Ukrainian defense capabilities. Russian forces use cheap decoy drones with foreign components to overload Ukraine&apos;s air defense system, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Nov. 18. Russia has recently increased the number of large-scale drone attacks against Ukrainian cities, depleting Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and targeting critical infrastructure. According to HUR, Russian manufacturers use components from the U.S., China, the Netherlands, and Switzerland to produce the Gerbera drone, a cheaper and less deadly equivalent of Iran&apos;s Shahed, at a plant in Yelabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan, central Russia. The Gerbera drone can carry a combat payload similar to that of a kamikaze drone and conduct reconnaissance missions, particularly to detect air defense positions and record hits from other attack drones. The Gerbera is ten times cheaper than the Shahed or Geran drones due to the use of simple materials, such as plywood and foam. Yet, the drone contains a set of components from foreign manufacturers that &quot;are common for Russian weapons,&quot; according to HUR. Examination of the downed drones showed that Russia manufactures Gerberas based on a Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China. The Gerbera drones were developed by the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the supply of kits to Russia. The Gerbera&apos;s jamming-resistant antenna (CRPA) contains chips from Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, both made in the U.S., and NXP Semiconductors, made in the Netherlands. The flight controller also uses components manufactured by Texas Instruments, Atmel (USA), STMicroelectronics, U-Blox (Switzerland), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), and XLSEMI (China). The DLE60 engine is manufactured by the Chinese company Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co, Ltd. In the summer of 2024, the U.S. sanctioned this company for supplying Russia. Supplies are made through third-party companies, according to HUR. &quot;At this point, the biggest advantage that Russia may have in such attacks is sheer numbers of drones,&quot; Samuel Bendett, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Bendett mentioned the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia&apos;s Republic of Tatarstan, where a Shahed-type drones plant is located. In May, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported, citing a contract leaked by the Prana Network hacker group, that the factory already produces 4,500 Shaheds and aims to increase this number to 6,000. &quot;It appears that Russian efforts in Alabuga have ensured that the Russian military has thousands such UAVs at its disposal along with other simpler, smaller variance identified recently that fly alongside these official Geran (Russian name for Shahed-type) UAVs,&quot; Bendett said. On Nov. 17, Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes against the country throughout the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched by Russia overnight.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russian-missile-attack-on-odesa-hits-residential-area-kills-10-injures-47/	2024-11-18T13:28:28-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-18_14-56-15.jpg
Ukraine aid key to battling Russian invasion — Can Europe fill the gap if Trump pulls the plug?	Amid rising fears of U.S. aid being cut off under a second Donald Trump presidency, Ukrainians are left wondering whether Europe can rise to the challenge and fill the gap. Trump has promised to swiftly end Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, speaking highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and making unflattering comments about his Ukrainian counterpart. Fears that Ukraine&apos;s top Western ally could pull the plug on aid that is key to fending off Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, now in its third year, swelled this past weekend when those close to the president-elect made a few jabs at Ukraine and its president. Donald Trump Jr., the son of the president-elect with a seemingly increasing influence, has publicly stated his opposition to Ukraine&apos;s right to use Western-provided weapons to hit targets inside Russia. &quot;The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War III going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,&quot; Trump Jr. wrote on X on Nov. 17, commenting on reports that outgoing President Joe Biden had authorized the use of U.S.-made ATACMS against targets inside Russia. As the decision came in the last months of Biden&apos;s term in office, it remains unclear whether Trump will uphold the policy after he returns to the White House.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)And while Ukraine has a number of influential allies in Europe that would have the power to pick up where the U.S. might leave, doing so in the upcoming year would be a near-impossible task. &quot;Trump&apos;s victory could scarcely have come at a worse time,&quot; Nick Witney, a security expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Most European governments are in economic or political difficulties, or both.&quot; Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was a wake-up call for Europe. Since then, Europe&apos;s defense industry has increased its ammunition production capacity by 50%. It aims to produce over 2 million shells per year by the end of 2025 &#x2014; double its capacity in February 2022, according to the European Council of Foreign Relations. Stefan Wolff, professor of international security at the University of Birmingham, said that &quot;the EU defense industrial base has improved and will continue to improve, not least because it is now possible to allocate structural/cohesion funding to security projects within the EU.&quot; &quot;This will not benefit Ukraine directly, but it will likely mean more investment into defense capacity in general,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;This could then also benefit Ukraine but again not necessarily in the timeframe dictated by events in the U.S.&quot; Fabian Hoffmann, a defense policy expert at the University of Oslo&apos;s Oslo Nuclear Project, agreed that &quot;Europe has significantly ramped up production of some capabilities, such as 155mm artillery shells and other types of ammunition.&quot; &quot;In these areas, Europe could compensate relatively well, although the absence of U.S. assistance would, of course, still be felt,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Hoffmann argued that, compared with the U.S., Europe does not have some crucial types of weapons needed by Ukraine. He said that the &quot;U.S. maintains a large reserve arsenal of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles that could be made available to Ukraine, whereas Europe lacks such reserves.&quot; The U.S. also has about 2,000 AGM-158A JASSM cruise missiles and another 2,000+ AGM-158B JASSM-ER cruise missiles in its arsenal, while &quot;European states do not have anywhere near that number of cruise missiles,&quot; he added. Moreover, the U.S. is &quot;the sole producer of interceptors for Patriot and NASAMS air defense systems,&quot; he said. &quot;If the U.S. were to withdraw as a supplier, Ukraine would face severe challenges in missile defense, particularly against ballistic missile threats,&quot; Hoffmann added.

(Lithuanian MOD / X)Europe producing more weaponry, but it&apos;s not enoughEven with the increase in military production of those weapons Europe is capable of offering without U.S. oversight, the deliveries have not been large enough to meet Ukraine&apos;s needs, analysts say. Pavel Havlicek, an expert on Russia and Ukraine at the Czech Republic&apos;s Association of International Affairs, argued that &quot;over the past two and half years, the EU proved very slow, even somehow lenient, to expand military production, massively increase military spending and investments, or boost its military industry.&quot; &quot;If you ask me if the EU can overnight replace the role of the U.S., it is absolutely no &#x2014; since the American backing is multilayered and strategic, including the air protection &#x2014; Patriot (air defense systems), mid- and long-range missiles that operate on the U.S. tech, including with their precision or intelligence gathering, which is key with limited resources at the battlefield,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent.

(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)Lucian Kim, senior analyst for Ukraine at the International Crisis Group, also said that Europe would not be able to fill the gap because &quot;Europe&apos;s militaries &#x2014; Germany&apos;s in particular &#x2014; are themselves under-armed, and Western allies lack both the stocks and production capacity to match the assistance Ukraine has been receiving from the U.S.&quot; He cited problems with the Czech-led initiative to supply artillery shells to Ukraine. The initiative, which was announced in early 2024, aims to deliver 1 million shells to Ukraine by the end of this year but it has faced delays. European Union&apos;s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, announced on Nov. 11 that the bloc had delivered 980,000 artillery shells to Ukraine out of the 1 million promised. He explained the shortfall, citing unexpected production capacity limits. Samantha de Bendern, an associate fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House, agreed that the EU was unlikely to fill the gap if the U.S. pulled the plug on aid. &quot;While the EU and its member states have made strides in increasing military aid and production, the stark reality remains that Europe cannot yet fill the void left by the United States, either in terms of its own defense or that of Ukraine,&quot; she told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;As long as perceived national interests continue to diverge and political stability wavers, particularly in key countries like Germany and France, Europe will struggle to forge a unified and effective response to the war raging on its continent.&quot; She also said that &quot;Europe is now in a position in which it cannot defend the country that has sacrificed tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives to defend not only its own territory but Europe as a whole.&quot; De Bendern said that European governments were under pressure from the electorate to spend money on health infrastructure and other public projects rather than Ukraine. &quot;The question for them is whether you spend money on Ukraine or build another hospital,&quot; she added. Apart from technical limitations, there are political problems that obstruct a further increase in Europe&apos;s aid for Ukraine. These include political instability in Germany, where Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos; coalition has collapsed. &quot;Germany, Europe&apos;s largest military donor to Ukraine, has plunged into political chaos with the collapse of the Scholz-led coalition. France&apos;s Emmanuel Macron, a staunch defender of Ukraine in spite of his initial impulses to seek a dialog with (Vladimir) Putin, has lost much of his freedom of action since the parliamentary elections in June in which he lost his parliamentary majority,&quot; De Bendern said. &quot;Elsewhere in Europe, political parties on the far right or far left of the political spectrum with pro-Russian sympathies are rising,&quot; De Bendern added. &quot;Already-fragile EU unity, a stalled Franco-German motor, a Trojan Horse in the shape of (Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor) Orban holding the presidency,&quot; Witney said, listing the problems the EU is facing. &quot;(All) will come under further pressure as individual states delude themselves they can build &apos;special relationships&apos; with Trump, and that supporting his agenda for Ukraine would be a good way to win favor.&quot; When asked for a comment, a spokesperson for the European Commission referred the Kyiv Independent to a Nov. 18 statement by Borrell, who said that &quot;we have to continue supporting Ukraine as much as we can and quicker, as quick as we can.&quot; France&apos;s President Emmanuel Macron (R) shakes hands with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky as he arrives prior to their meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Oct. 10, 2024.

In the EU, Germany is the biggest donor, with 12%. &quot;These figures speak for themselves: for the EU to replace the U.S., it would have to double the amount of military aid it gives to Ukraine,&quot; De Bendern said. &quot;The current political situation in Europe, as well as the real military capabilities of individual European countries, mean that Europe will not be able to step up in the short term.&quot; But it all boils down to the presence of political will. If there is a will, Europe will be able to at least partially fill the gap in case of a U.S. withdrawal, according to analysts. &quot;There is so much more Europe can afford to do or could do creatively with some more money, including the frozen Russian assets,&quot; Sascha Bruchmann, a military analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It is the lack of political will and geopolitical na&#xEF;vet&#xE9;, not financial weakness, that holds Europe back.&quot; Susan Stewart, an expert at the Eastern Europe and Eurasia Division of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said that, although the EU may not be able to undertake some projects as a bloc, some of its member states could create a coalition to boost support. &quot;There could be a sort of &apos;coalition of the willing&apos; of those states that see their own security as severely threatened and/or have shown unwavering support for Ukraine,&quot; she said. &quot;A possible beginning of this coalition may be indicated by the meetings Donald Tusk is planning with the leaders of the UK, France, and the Baltic and Nordic states. And it will certainly not hurt that Poland will take over the presidency of the EU for six months in January 2025.&quot; Stephen Hall, lecturer in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath, argues that supporting Ukraine is vital for Europe&apos;s survival. &quot;Europe has to step up for its own safety as well,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. Yet it&apos;s up to the countries that understand the risks to do so, no matter what U.S. policy come January will be. A spokesperson for Rheinmetall, one of Germany&apos;s largest defense companies, said that it &quot;is a strategic partner of Ukraine and intends to support the country in the long term.&quot; &quot;This applies regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election,&quot; he told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;Should the countries of Europe decide to increase their support for Ukraine in the future, Rheinmetall will do everything in its power to meet these increased demands as well.&quot; Martin Fornusek and Chris York contributed to this story.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-aid-key-to-battling-russian-invasion-can-europe-fill-the-gap-if-trump-pulls-the-plug/	2024-11-18T13:02:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2181862302.jpg
Borrell confirms US authorization for Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with missiles up to 300 km in range	Editor&apos;s note: This story is being updated. The U.S. has authorized Ukraine to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory, the European Union&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell confirmed on Nov. 18 following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. &quot;The Biden administration has authorized the use of its weapons up to 300 kilometers inside Russian territory,&quot; he said. &quot;The American administration said no for a long time, and they ended up saying yes.&quot; Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Kyiv and Washington did not provide a clear statement on whether the authorization to strike deep into Russia with US-made missiles was granted. Borrell was the first official to confirm the move.Answering the question of why Joe Biden&apos;s administration decided to authorize long-range strikes against Russia now, Borrell said he did not know why the White House made this decision after the presidential election and not before. Borrell also confirmed that this permit was indeed granted and is spread over a distance of 300 kilometers (187 miles). &quot;It&apos;s not that much by way of a distance. It&apos;s not a very long distance. It doesn&apos;t go deep into the country, but this is the decision by the administration,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;I think it&apos;s reasonable to provide arms, not just to stop the arrows, but also to fight the bowmen,&quot; Borrell added. The diplomat also highlighted that in the EU, each country makes its own decisions on the use of its weapons by Ukraine.Biden has been long adamant about not allowing Western-supplied weapons to be used on Russian soil, fearing an escalation. He first eased the restrictions in May to allow Ukraine to use certain weaponry like HIMARS to strike at Russian troops just across the border in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision, said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. As the decision came in the last months of Biden&apos;s term in office, it remains unclear whether Trump will uphold the policy after he returns to the White House.	https://kyivindependent.com/borrell-confirms-us-authorization-for-ukraine-to-strike-deep-into-russia-with-missiles-up-to-300-km-in-range/	2024-11-18T11:41:41-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2154346451.jpg
Duda criticizes Scholz's call to Putin, saying 'it's a mistake'	Polish President Andrzej Duda called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;a mistake&quot; in his post on X on Nov. 18. Scholz spoke with Putin on Nov. 15 for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Scholz&apos;s call with Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls.&quot; &quot;I doubt that the German Chancellor&apos;s conversation with Putin was agreed with the allies,&quot; Duda said. &quot;Russia is brutally attacking Ukraine, and one of the leaders of European countries, a strong economy, is holding talks with the aggressor. I think this is a mistake,&quot; Duda added. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Minsk and Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In remarks during Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, Zelensky said the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/duda-criticizes-scholzs-call-to-putin-saying-its-a-mistake/	2024-11-18T10:22:55-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1676988608.jpg
UN watchdog confirms riot control agent used on Ukraine battlefield	The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed on Nov. 18 that a riot control agent known as CS has been used in Ukraine, as evidence mounts that Russia has scaled up its attacks using chemical weapons in recent months. The United Nations watchdog OPCW&apos;s first confirmation about the tear gas usage comes as Russia has intensified its use of chemical agents since the beginning of the year to advance forward across Ukraine&apos;s front line. Russian drones throw gas grenades into dugouts or trenches in an attempt to force Ukrainian soldiers out into the open field, making them easy prey for drone or artillery attacks. The U.S. and the U.K. have confirmed Russia&apos;s deployment of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers, slapping sanctions on Russia&apos;s troops of Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense, their chief, Russian Defense Ministry scientific centers, and companies involved. The Ukrainian military has reported that it recorded over 4,600 cases of Russia using gas attacks on the battlefield since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022, including 323 incidents in November. Without naming Russia nor directly confronting Moscow for violating the Chemical Weapons Convention, the OPCW said that samples from both the grenade and the soil sample retrieved from a September incident at a specific trench &quot;contained the riot control agent 2-Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile, known as CS.&quot; While often used to disperse riots and considered nonlethal, the OPCW says that tear gas, including CS, is &quot;considered chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare.&quot; The samples &#x2014; which underwent separate testing in two OPCW-designated laboratories &#x2014; were collected from a trench &quot;located along the confrontation lines with the opposing troops&quot; in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, according to the report. The OPCW said in the Nov. 18 report that the watchdog&apos;s Director-General, Ambassador Fernando Arias, &quot;expressed grave concern over the findings.&quot; &quot;All 193 OPCW Member States, including the Russian Federation and Ukraine, have committed never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, transfer or use chemical weapons,&quot; Arias said. He stressed that the parties have declared that &quot;any use of chemical weapons is totally unacceptable and would violate the legal norms and standards of the international community.&quot; Earlier in May, OPCW said that Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of deploying chemical weapons, but &quot;the information provided to the Organization so far by both sides, together with the information available to the Secretariat, is insufficiently substantiated.&quot; While Russia&apos;s usage of chemical agents has slightly decreased since August, when 447 cases were recorded by the Ukrainian military within a month, Kyiv has been concerned about unidentified gas being deployed against its soldiers. Lacking &quot;hundreds&quot; of complex detectors that cost $100,000 to $600,000 to identify the chemicals used by Russian troops, the Ukrainian military has struggled to name the new or mixed types of gas to find a solution to how to protect its personnel, Ukrainian Colonel Artem Vlasiuk told the Kyiv Independent in October. Of the 323 recorded cases of Russia&apos;s chemical attacks in October, all except 15 incidents were &quot;unidentified,&quot; according to Vlasiuk from the Support Forces&apos; Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection Command, a branch of the army responsible for inspecting chemical warfare. The officer said that Ukraine struggled to identify the new types of gas because it lacked sophisticated high-end detector technology to diagnose beyond the few prototypes in its library &#x2014; which includes CS, CN, chloropicrin, and ammonia. It is often very difficult to send specialists to the front line for evidence collection, as it would mean risking their lives by having them walk kilometers to reach the positions. And when soldiers come under gas attacks, gathering the remains of the grenades used is usually not the priority. The concerns over the unidentified gas come as dozens of Ukrainian soldiers interviewed by the Kyiv Independent across the front over the summer acknowledged their lack of preparedness to face chemical warfare. Many said they were only given the poor quality Soviet-era gas masks and that they do not take it to positions because they are skeptical of its effectiveness. Often, comparing the danger of chemical agents to KAB guided-aerial bombs, artillery, and precise FPV drones, the infantrymen interviewed often downplayed the threat of gas &#x2014; arguing that they had more chance of being killed or wounded by conventional arms. At least three Ukrainian soldiers died from Russia&apos;s gas attacks, and almost 2,100 soldiers sought medical care after such incidents, according to the Support Forces. Many more could have gone unrecorded.	https://kyivindependent.com/un-watchdog-confirms-riot-control-agent-used-on-ukraine-battlefield/	2024-11-18T09:58:14-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1240855736.jpg
Unprecedented escalation' — Fico criticizes US for permitting use of ATACMS to strike Russia	Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico criticized the U.S. decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russia with long-range ATACMS missiles in his Nov. 18 statement posted on Facebook. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Fico claimed that Biden has authorized the use of ATACMS against targets in Russia &quot;to disrupt or delay peace talks completely.&quot; &quot;This is an unprecedented escalation of tension,&quot; Fico said, echoing the Kremlin&apos;s stance. The prime minister added that he had instructed Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar and Defense Minister Robert Kalinak not to support the U.S. decision &quot;in any international forum or in any way.&quot; &quot;Those who want to see the war in Ukraine continue are harming national and state interests,&quot; Fico said, adding that it is &quot;extremely important&quot; for Slovakia, as a neighbor of Ukraine, to achieve peace there. Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow&apos;s talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war. On Nov. 18, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the outgoing U.S. administration intends to &quot;provoke an escalation of the war&quot; in Ukraine. Several Russian lawmakers called the step an escalation that could &quot;lead to World War III&quot; and the end of Ukrainian statehood. Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously said that long-range strikes against Russia with Western arms would mean NATO&apos;s involvement in the war, adding that Moscow is preparing &quot;various responses&quot; to such a step.	https://kyivindependent.com/unprecedented-escalation-fico-criticizes-us-for-permitting-use-of-atacms-to-strike-russia/	2024-11-18T09:33:57-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-2152712934.jpg

Russia uses cheap decoy drones to overload Ukraine's air defense, Ukrainian intelligence says	Russian forces use cheap decoy drones with foreign components to overload Ukraine&apos;s air defense system, Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) reported on Nov. 18. Russia has recently increased the number of large-scale drone attacks against Ukrainian cities, depleting Ukraine&apos;s air defense systems and targeting critical infrastructure. According to HUR, Russian manufacturers use components from the U.S., China, the Netherlands, and Switzerland to produce the Gerbera drone, a cheaper and less deadly equivalent of Iran&apos;s Shahed, at a plant in Yelabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan, central Russia. The Gerbera drone can carry a combat payload similar to that of a kamikaze drone and conduct reconnaissance missions, particularly to detect air defense positions and record hits from other attack drones. The Gerbera is ten times cheaper than the Shahed or Geran drones due to the use of simple materials, such as plywood and foam. Yet, the drone contains a set of components from foreign manufacturers that &quot;are common for Russian weapons,&quot; according to HUR. Examination of the downed drones showed that Russia manufactures Gerberas based on a Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China. The Gerbera drones were developed by the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the supply of kits to Russia. The Gerbera&apos;s jamming-resistant antenna (CRPA) contains chips from Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, both made in the U.S., and NXP Semiconductors, made in the Netherlands. The flight controller also uses components manufactured by Texas Instruments, Atmel (USA), STMicroelectronics, U-Blox (Switzerland), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), and XLSEMI (China). The DLE60 engine is manufactured by the Chinese company Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co, Ltd. In the summer of 2024, the U.S. sanctioned this company for supplying Russia. Supplies are made through third-party companies, according to HUR. &quot;At this point, the biggest advantage that Russia may have in such attacks is sheer numbers of drones,&quot; Samuel Bendett, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. Bendett mentioned the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia&apos;s Republic of Tatarstan, where a Shahed-type drones plant is located. In May, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported, citing a contract leaked by the Prana Network hacker group, that the factory already produces 4,500 Shaheds and aims to increase this number to 6,000. &quot;It appears that Russian efforts in Alabuga have ensured that the Russian military has thousands such UAVs at its disposal along with other simpler, smaller variance identified recently that fly alongside these official Geran (Russian name for Shahed-type) UAVs,&quot; Bendett said. On Nov. 17, Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes against the country throughout the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched by Russia overnight.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-trying-to-overload-ukraines-air-defense-with-decoy-drones-made-of-plywood-foreign-parts-ukrainian-intelligence-says/	2024-11-18T09:17:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/01/GettyImages-1489472156.jpg
Not waiting for Ukraine’s reconstruction, a U.S. entrepreneur is expanding his business in small-town Ukraine	When Chicagoan Chris Exline decided to expand his furniture rental company to Ukraine, he did not expect to relocate his life to a small town of 20,000 people in Ternopil Oblast. The businessman and CEO of Home Essentials initially planned to rent furniture to expats and organizations flooding in to help Ukraine&#x2019;s reconstruction and EU assimilation. The New Jersey-headquartered company had previously furnished the offices and residents of diplomats and embassies in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan. When it became apparent that reconstruction was a long way off, Exline altered his business plan to go beyond his usual clients like USAID, a U.S. governmental aid agency. He opened a store in Kremenets in western Ukraine selling home goods from beds to scented candles with the option to pay in monthly installments through a layaway plan. While many investors are staying away from Ukraine until the end of the war, Exline has calculated a fruitful blueprint for smaller Ukrainian towns that have historically been ignored by foreign entrepreneurs. He has permanently relocated to Kremenets and has secured a stable client base of local homeowners while also donating mattresses to internally displaced people and soldiers on the front. &#x201C;Being based in Kremenets heightened my sensitivity and urgency to saving and creating jobs. That was a primary reason for locating here,&#x201D; he told the Kyiv Independent in an interview on the sidelines of the Kyiv Mayor&#x2019;s Summit on Nov. 8. Exline has since funneled hundreds of thousands of euros into his Ukrainian venture and will launch a factory producing upholstered furniture at the end of the year for the domestic and European markets. For now, the company has one shop in Kremenets and operations in Kyiv for corporate offices and diplomats. But Exline says there is an opportunity to expand rapidly in the next two years and bring the furniture rental business model to the mainstream, despite initial suspicion from locals. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Kyiv Independent. Why did you choose to open your business in Ukraine? &#xA0; Chris Exline: Like the entire world, I was shocked on Feb. 24, 2022. Then, four to six weeks later, I was shocked again that Ukraine was not going to capitulate. Simultaneously, there were estimates of reconstruction costs and EU integration talks. I realized we needed to get in early to be prepared (for reconstruction). We announced plans to enter the market and started receiving investment profiles from different oblasts in the summer of 2022. I got offers from all these towns with castles and 500-year-old monasteries. I thought, &#x201C;This is like a Disney movie!&#x201D; We knew that reconstruction would be happening in lots of different areas. A primary reason was also to get closer to a supply base. Bringing furniture in from China was a nonstarter because of shipping, cost of logistics, and timing. Home Essentials mattresses at the factory. (Home Essentials&apos;s private archive)We teamed up with a mattress factory in Kremenets, Ternopil Oblast, and were going to buy it but that fell through. I struck a deal with the owner to buy mattresses every month but we didn&apos;t really have an outlet to sell them in Kremenets, which is a town of 20,000 people, with 40% unemployment back in October 2022. The town also had 3,500 IDPs. I arrived on Oct. 3, 2022, and the next day I donated hundreds of mattresses to children who were sleeping on cardboard in a school and their families. &#xA0; We started the mattress donations and from that period I realized why I should be in Kremenets. The multiplier effect of what we did here would be much greater than if we were in Lviv, Ternopil, or Kyiv. &#xA0; By February 2023, it was obvious that the pace and scale of reconstruction weren&apos;t going to be as anticipated. &#xA0;I had to do something so I opened a Home Essentials store on May 1, 2023 &#x2014; the first home decor shop in Kremenets. I hope to open in Kopychyntsi (Ternopil Oblast) and Zolochiv (Lviv Oblast) before the end of the year. Afterward, we&apos;re going to open 25 stores within the next 25 months. Kyiv Independent: How do you find the locations? Chris Exline: Our staff did an exhaustive study and identified about a hundred towns. In those surveys, we look at the population, employment, the percentage of people on pensions, age, industries, and competitors. We identified towns all over Ukraine with similar demographics to Kremenets. Right now, it&apos;s our preference to do something more concentric and close to a fulfillment center. Once we have those stores, then we have sales and economies of scale to support our own manufacturing and then we&apos;re able to pass those savings on to the customers. Kyiv Independent: How does your business model work and could it become more commonplace in Ukraine? Chris Exline: It will be. We&apos;ve brought in an innovative new way of doing business. We have zero percent interest, we have no credit checks, it&apos;s a two-page agreement, and we don&apos;t use any banks. When I was figuring out how to change the business and align it with market expectations, I looked at a core component of Ukrainian culture, which is not to trust anyone at first. In Kremenets, the fact that I keep coming back again and again has built up trust. I tailored our business model. We don&#x2019;t accept cash until we deliver, we have stores so people can come in and see and touch, and we give them certain flexibility. We never turn their paper over to a bank. We don&apos;t ask troubling questions like proof of income, bank statements, or typical things that you would need to get a loan or finance. When people realize that we&apos;re not dependent on a bank and that we do this through our own cash flow, it shows them that we are a strong company. &#xA0; There was one customer who had a faulty mattress. She was shocked when we replaced it free of charge without an argument. She was expecting a confrontation.

(Alexey Furman/Getty Images)Kyiv Independent: How many people do you currently employ? Chris Exline: Currently 25. We will easily have 100-150 people when we have 25 stores. &#xA0; After we realized that the original premise for our market entry was not going to happen, a.k.a. really assisting in reconstruction, I stayed and continued to invest. I&apos;ve been here when we went four days without water and I had to use snow to clean plates. I chose to look at business setbacks and business reorientations and adapt. When hostilities cease, Ukrainians are going to know who was here and who is just coming in. When you&apos;re building a brand, people will remember. Had I stayed in Kyiv or Lviv, I wouldn&apos;t get a sense of what real Ukraine is going through. I think it&apos;s made me a better businessman. Our brand has very high goodwill with our customer base because we offer a very good service: We deliver on time, we charge less than other people, and we&apos;re plowing money back in through charitable efforts and helping those in need. That&apos;s why we&apos;re growing. Kyiv Independent: Do foreign investors need to reassess their understanding of business in Ukraine? Chris Exline: There are a lot of small companies in Europe that want to come in, but they don&apos;t have the financial resources. Denmark has a fund for Danish companies, and the same with the Netherlands and Poland. That business model is flawed. You have to make a business case to bureaucrats in Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Warsaw, that you&apos;re going to come here and make money in doing so. But they&apos;re small companies, so they don&apos;t really have the resources. Large companies would never think of asking their government for seed capital or funding to come into Ukraine. They have the resources to do it but they are waiting until the end of the war. There&apos;s also a huge disconnect. Companies don&apos;t know how to come in because there&apos;s no clarity and no one to talk to. The Reconstruction Agency&#x2019;s director (Mustafa Nayyem) tried to attend the Recovery Conference in Berlin on this very subject. But he couldn&apos;t leave the country (to attend the conference) and then it took four months to find his replacement. What kind of message are you sending? You&apos;ve got all these people in Berlin, wanting to talk to the head of restoration, and he&apos;s not allowed to leave the country. The Home Essentials store in Kremenets, Ternopil Oblast. Chris Exline (right) posing with a mattress in an undated photo. (Home Essentials&apos;s private archive)The Kyiv Independent: How do you assess the business environment in Ukraine for foreign investors? Chris Exline: I think the opportunities for foreign investors are enormous and our (furniture rental) market is going to be very big. I would find it extremely hard to justify being here if the market was only in the tens of millions. I believe that our businesses in Ukraine could eclipse the businesses that we&apos;ve had combined over the past 25 years. If I see an opportunity in this small niche of furniture retail in towns of about 20,000 people in Ukraine, what are all the other opportunities that people can do? I&apos;m here because of the sacrifices of 2003, 2014, and obviously today. I know that Ukraine, no matter what happens, is never going back into a Russian system.	https://kyivindependent.com/not-waiting-for-ukraines-reconstruction-a-u-s-entrepreneur-is-expanding-his-business-in-small-town-ukraine/	2024-11-18T09:17:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1244363669.jpg
Nothing new under the sun' — German, French foreign ministers react on Ukrainian long-range strikes	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot reacted on Nov. 18 to Washington easing restrictions on Ukraine&apos;s long-range strikes. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Baerbock welcomed that U.S. President Joe Biden allowed Kyiv to use US long-range missiles against targets in Russia, the German news agency DPA reported, citing German broadcaster RBB Inforadio. &quot;Ukrainians shouldn&apos;t have to wait for rockets to cross the border &#x2014; &#xA0;they should be able to destroy launch sites directly,&quot; Baerbock said. Baerbock, who represents the Greens, said her party stands with its Eastern European partners, as well as the British, French, and American governments, in allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia. Barrot, during a meeting with journalists in Brussels, recalled that French President Emmanuel Macron had expressed his willingness to consider using French missiles to strike at Russian territory back in May. The French minister added that Paris remains &quot;open&quot; to allowing Ukraine to use French long-range missiles to hit military targets in Russia after the U.S. allowed Kyiv to use American missiles for the same purpose. &quot;We openly said that this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike targets from where Russians are currently aggressing Ukrainian territory,&quot; Barrot told reporters in Brussels, Le Monde reported. &quot;Nothing new under the sun,&quot; Barrot added ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers. Ukraine has previously received U.S.-made ATACMS and Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles from the U.K. and France, with a range of 300 kilometers (190 miles) and 250 kilometers (150 miles), respectively. Yet, Paris and London have not permitted Kyiv to use their long-range weapons to strike deep into Russia amid Washington&apos;s doubts. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in turn, is not planning to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles despite the U.S. easing restrictions on long-range strikes. Berlin&apos;s policy may soon shift as Germany heads toward snap elections on Feb. 23, with the center-right opposition alliance CDU/CSU currently leading the polls and threatening to oust Scholz.	https://kyivindependent.com/nothing-new-under-the-sun-german-french-foreign-ministers-react-on-ukrainian-long-range-strikes/	2024-11-18T08:12:46-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/baerbock.jpeg
Turkey's peace plan for war in Ukraine 'unacceptable,' Russia says	The Kremlin on Nov. 18 dismissed a peace plan for Ukraine reportedly to be put forward by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, describing it as &quot;unacceptable.&quot; Erdogan&apos;s proposal would include Ukraine abstaining from joining NATO for at least 10 years, freezing the current front line, providing Ukraine with weapons, and deploying international troops to a demilitarized buffer zone in the country&apos;s east, Bloomberg reported. The news outlet also said Erdogan would propose the plan during G20 talks commencing on Nov. 18. Reacting to the reports, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the proposal. &quot;The option of freezing the line of military conflict is unacceptable for the Russian side,&quot; he said in comments reported by Interfax. Erdogan&apos;s proposal comes as NATO countries prepare for a Donald Trump presidency, which many fear will lead to the U.S. pressuring Ukraine to end the war quickly, even at the cost of territorial concessions. The G20 countries are set to convene in Brazil without the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brazil is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin last year for the abduction of Ukrainian children. &#x200C; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also not be present, despite numerous appeals to receive an invitation.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky said on Nov. 16 that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025.&#x200C;&#x200C;	https://kyivindependent.com/turkeys-peace-plan-for-war-in-ukraine-unacceptable-russia-says/	2024-11-18T07:24:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1258775915.jpg
‘Battle-tested in Ukraine’ — How US drone makers turned Ukraine into a tagline to sell west	The biggest weapons makers in the world convened in Washington, D.C. for the 70th meeting of the Association of the United States Army in early October. It was the third year in a row where Ukraine remained at the center of the event&apos;s enormous buzz. Synchronized press releases ensued. Anduril, a heavy hitter among Silicon Valley&#x2019;s new generation of miltech unicorns, put out a flurry of announcements touting its generalized &#x201C;success in Ukraine&#x201D; as a pitch for new drone systems that were receiving lucrative contracts with the U.S. Defense Department. Western militaries are not shy about viewing Ukraine as a &#x201C;laboratory&#x201D; or &#x201C;testing ground&#x201D; for high-tech weapons. Given both the unprecedented use of drones in Ukraine and the novelty of the industry globally, U.S. manufacturers are keen to headline their work at the Ukrainian frontline. &#x201C;You cannot field an American drone system today that doesn&apos;t have the moniker of &#x2018;battle-tested in Ukraine&#x2019; on it. You can&#x2019;t. Which is why everybody&#x2019;s trying to do it,&#x201D; says James Acuna, a 20-year CIA operations officer and former naval architect, currently consulting on drones from Estonia. A combination of Silicon Valley PR machines and military secrecy makes total impact tough to gauge, but reports indicate that Western drones have not been particularly helpful to Ukraine, proving weak in the face of Russian electronic warfare. That has not stopped U.S. drone makers from constantly advertising product impact and C-suite man-hours logged in Ukraine as a pitch to better-heeled Western militaries, especially the U.S. &#x201C;Because you don&apos;t have success in Ukraine, you need to start embellishing, speaking half-truths. And it doesn&#x2019;t matter, because nobody can fact-check,&#x201D; Acuna says. Ukrainian soldier operates a drone during training of the 22nd Brigade in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 3 May 2024. (Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)The Ukrainian government has accepted foreign-funded weapons packages including Western drones, but has shown little interest in buying the weapons as they are exorbitantly expensive compared to domestically-produced drones. &#x201C;My problem with some of these drone companies is they&apos;ve been preaching about how much they&apos;ve been helping Ukraine for years or whatever, and what they did is they sold the U.S. government a bunch of stuff, made a bunch of money, and didn&apos;t support the end users,&#x201D; Bryan Sardoch told the Kyiv Independent from the AUSA conference. Sardoch is an American working for U.S-Ukrainian drone developer Bavovna.AI, which itself recently closed a $2.7 million seed round. U.S. weapons producers have treated inclusion in arms packages to Ukraine as a form of field testing since the war&#x2019;s outset. Performance in Ukraine &#x201C;validates&#x201D; production quality, as one Army officer put it. But while testing in Ukraine intuitively implies battlefield use, there are shortcuts. Remote fields across Ukraine have been designated as polyhony &#x2014; testing sites which Ukrainians use to try out their own drones. A cottage industry has cropped up resembling &#x201C;cruises&#x201D; for new Western drone companies looking to say they&#x2019;ve been tested in Ukraine, says Acuna. &#x201C;American companies will find &#x2014; and I&apos;ve butted heads with some of these people that offer this &#x2014; They&apos;ll say oh, three days, 3,800 euros, including assistance with customs and getting your drones into Ukraine, providing a unit that will evaluate your systems, a driver, hotels, mostly in Zhytomyr Oblast,&#x201D; says Acuna, referring wryly to a region some 70 miles west of Kyiv. &#x201C;It&apos;s a three-day package, 3,800 bucks, and inevitably, you get up-charged.&#x201D; Acuna says there is no comprehensive national certification for drone testing and a host of various letters of recommendation that units offer that are useless. He noted in particular claims that companies have passed &#x201C;rigorous specifications that the Defense Ministry has established for drone operations,&#x201D; or a similar standardized certifications. &#x201C;There&apos;s no gauntlet test that you do. Everything&apos;s informal, and everything is dependent on the unit or the brigade that you may talk to,&#x201D; says Acuna. Because of this systemic informality, it is impossible to say that a drone company has never been used at the front. Since the war&#x2019;s start, however, U.S. drone makers have fallen short, both in terms of the products delivered and their responsiveness to complaints from Ukrainian users. &#x201C;I got angry at how our stuff wasn&#x2019;t working,&#x201D; says Sardoch of the early days. He found himself in Ukraine at the start of Russia&#x2019;s invasion trying to link Ukrainian soldier complaints with American drone companies, &#x201C;fixing a lot of stupid stuff, honestly, with the American and U.K. drones that came over.&quot; &#x201C;There were a lot of issues with them both physically on the hardware or the software setup that were generally oversights.&#x201D; Ivan Kaunov, a drone pilot for the Ukrainian military turned developer of his own recon drones, recalls trying to hassle Western manufacturers about their equipment falling to Russian jammers two years ago only to be brushed off. &#x201C;They told me to tighten the antenna,&#x201D; he recalls one condescending response to navigation failing in the face of Russian electronic warfare. &#x201C;Western companies weren&#x2019;t listening about GPS. Now everybody knows that you can&#x2019;t use GPS (due to Russian EW).&#x201D; Those early issues have been the subject of prior reporting. Due to demand from the front that far surpassed foreign drone packages, Ukraine proceeded to build up its own drone industry massively. Digital Transformation Minister Mikhaylo Fedorov recently wrote that 96% of the million drones to reach the frontlines in 2024 have been Ukrainian-made. The remainder are predominantly Chinese, with limited Western drones on the ground.

Aerovironment saw 700 of its highly portable Switchblade 300s sent to Ukraine as part of a U.S. defense package early in the war. Aerovironment makes frequent mention of &#x201C;lessons learned from the conflict in Ukraine&#x201D; in announcements of sales to other countries. But the U.S. Army said it would no longer buy the Switchblade 300s a year after their first appearance in Ukraine, potentially due to limited success against Russian vehicles and their high cost. Aerovironment&#x2019;s newer 600s are better at taking out armor. Some have come to Ukraine but in quantities unknown. Russia has already downed and likely reverse-engineered them. The firm did not respond to multiple requests for clarification. At the start of October, Aerovironment said it plans to start production of Switchblade 600s in Ukraine. But like a number of foreign weapons producers ranging from the U.S. Northrop Grumman to the Turkish Bayraktar setting up factories in Ukraine, those facilities aren&#x2019;t necessarily going to be in production in time to provide weapons to Ukraine before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January and a ceasefire deal is potentially negotiated. Major factories take time to set up in the best of circumstances, let alone when Russian missiles and drones crisscross Ukrainian skies nightly in search of targets to blow up. General Atomics, the maker of the $32 million Reaper drone, spent the duration of the 2023 counteroffensive trying to sell Ukraine two of those drones for a dollar in a marketing stunt that never resulted in those drones reaching Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal noted that it would cost $10 million to transport the two drones and another $8 million annually to maintain them. The Ukrainian government recently requested Shield AI&#x2019;s V-BAT drones &#x2014; in a request for the U.S. government to pay for 200 of the $1 million apiece units that the Californian drone startup advertised heavily. It is indicative of the general trend: Ukraine does not pay for US drones. They&#x2019;ll take them for free, but U.S. quality does not stack up to U.S. pricing relative to Ukrainian producers. &#x201C;Even with Skydio, like the X10, if you give it to me, it&apos;d be great, we&apos;re definitely gonna do good things with it, but at the cost, I&apos;d rather spend that money on several thousand of these smaller, cheaper, but still somewhat effective systems,&#x201D; says Sardoch. Founded in 2014, Skydio is likely the largest drone maker in the U.S. CEO Adam Bry appeared before Congress in June, mentioning Ukraine 65 times in his written remarks, making sure to introduce the country as &#x201C;where I recently visited.&#x201D; &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve shared our findings with colleagues in the Defense Department, and the U.S. military has begun to field new capabilities we developed with feedback from Ukraine and other customers, including resilient communications features,&#x201D; wrote Bry. &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6; We&#x2019;re deeply honored to have the &#x1D5D4;&#x1D5FF;&#x1D5FA;&#x1D5F2;&#x1D5F1; &#x1D5D9;&#x1D5FC;&#x1D5FF;&#x1D5F0;&#x1D5F2;&#x1D600; &#x1D5FC;&#x1D5F3; &#x1D5E8;&#x1D5F8;&#x1D5FF;&#x1D5EE;&#x1D5F6;&#x1D5FB;&#x1D5F2; senior officials tour Skydio HQ and our manufacturing facilities, and share their perspective with us on how drones are making a difference on the frontlines.From our experience serving incredible,&#x2026; pic.twitter.com/gUnfQoj3HM Bry continues to make appearances touting Ukraine as the future of defense &#x2014; as well as Skydio&#x2019;s eagerness to sell its drones to Ukraine. That is despite Skydio&#x2019;s drones proving &#x201C;not a very successful platform on the front lines,&#x201D; as Bry admitted to the Wall Street Journal in April, as part of an investigation into the overall failures of U.S. drones in Ukraine. In addition to heavy marketing from companies like Teledyne FLIR and Palantir, Acuna named two firms as the worst offenders of PR over substance in Ukraine: Skydio and Anduril. In the run-up to AUSA, Anduril announced a $250 million contract for 500 anti-drone &#x201C;RoadRunner&#x201D; drones to the U.S. Defense Department. Two days later, Anduril announced the Bolt, a loitering surveillance drone that the firm says can also carry a munition. The product is up for a $250 million contract with the Marine Corps. The firm puts its cost in the low tens of thousands of dollars per unit. &#x201C;Anduril, as a venture startup, is a wonderful company, except they give too much credit to their PR guys that are just saying how successful they are in Ukraine and hoping that nobody really fact-checks them,&#x201D; says Acuna. &#x201C;Ghost was an absolute failure &#x2014; one of their tactical drone systems in Ukraine, this abject failure. To their credit, they came back with this Ghost X, which is fine, but then when that started failing, they just steered into the nonsense curve, as opposed to trying to fix it,&#x201D; Acuna said of Anduril&#x2019;s Ukraine marketing strategy. In July, Anduril CEO Palmer Luckey told NPR that &#x201C;Anduril has had hardware in Ukraine since the second week of the war,&#x201D; for a story headlined &#x201C;This U.S. company is helping arm Ukraine against Russia.&#x201D; Of five Ukrainian drone pilots and builders that the Kyiv Independent spoke with, none had seen an Anduril product on the front with Russia. &#x201C;This is the first time I&#x2019;m hearing their name,&#x201D; says Serhiy from his post in Vovchansk when asked about Anduril. Serhiy has been in the Ukrainian military for five years and started piloting drones just before Russia&#x2019;s February 2022 full-scale invasion. &#x201C;If they&#x2019;re out here, it&#x2019;s a couple of artificial test flights.&#x201D; Soldiers of the Armed Forces inspect the FPV drones during the handover from the volunteer organization in Lviv, Ukraine on Sep. 13, 2024. (Stanislav Ivanov/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)&#x201C;What&#x2019;s flying today is almost all Ukrainian. Also, there are still a lot of Chinese drones,&#x201D; says Serhiy, who is identified by first name only as Ukrainian servicemen are not authorized to speak to the press. Anduril did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Anduril&#x2019;s long-time insistence that it is repatriating the best drones to the U.S. is an open question. Anduril&#x2019;s new Bolt, for example, looks exactly like various models from DJI &#x2014; the much cheaper Chinese drone maker whose commercial Mavics were the first drones to see widespread combat use in Ukraine. Charles Johnson, a former far-right influencer, sometimes conspiracy theorist and more recently an investor in aerospace and defense companies like Clearview AI and Umbra Space, disparaged Anduril&#x2019;s patriotism. &#x201C;Anduril has Chinese parts. In particular, they have a Chinese motor. They have failed in a lot of ways in Ukraine, but failure has been no deterrent for them and all the marketing around Ukraine,&#x201D; Johnson tells the Kyiv Independent. Johnson describes himself as &#x201C;the first non-blood relation to invest in Anduril after Palmer Luckey&#x2019;s mother, Julie Luckey,&#x201D; an investment he claims he made at the behest of the U.S. government. He says he sold his stake back to Luckey in early 2023 as a response to the company&#x2019;s work in Ukraine. &#x201C;The American Silicon Valley tech sector has more or less failed in Ukraine. And the DoD has more or less failed in Ukraine.&#x201D; Business Insider reported that Johnson recruited Peter Thiel &#x2014; whose Founder&#x2019;s Fund remains a major backer of Anduril &#x2014; to become an FBI informant. A civil lawsuit recently alleged that Johnson has used his former ties to intel as the basis for an extortion scheme. &#x201C;A lot of the contractor class has deliberately made a real mess of this Ukraine conflict,&#x201D; says Johnson, saying these contractors and the U.S. military benefit from a protracted war. William Hartung of the anti-war Quincy Institute warned two years ago of &#x201C;the larger push to exploit the war in Ukraine to jack up Pentagon spending for things that have nothing to do with defending Ukraine, or any likely future scenario.&#x201D; Despite limited use in Ukraine, Anduril has seen its valuation in private funding jump from $4.6 billion in June 2021 to $8.5 billion last December to $14 billion in August. Skydio&#x2019;s valuation more than doubled in private investments between March 2021 and February 2023. Unlike Anduril, Skydio and most other drone makers, Aerovironment is publicly traded. After a long slide throughout 2021, Aerovironment&#x2019;s stock dipped below $60 in February 2022. Today, it is over $215. Those valuations are the result of more than just marketing &#x2014; they are also riding the tide of rising geopolitical tensions. Upon its August fundraising round, Anduril wrote, &quot;The conflict in Ukraine has exposed a critical vulnerability in the United States&#x2019; ability to respond to crisis. In a major conflict, use of weapons and munitions would quickly exceed supply &#x2014; it is projected that the United States would run out of weapons in the first few weeks.&#x201D; The US federal lobbying of these companies is also telling. Per Senate disclosures, Skydio reported $100,000 in lobbying contracts per quarter at the end of 2021. That number grew to $170,000 by the present day, including the hiring of Joe Bartlett as director of federal policy. Bartlett previously served as national security advisor to Representative Elise Stepanik, now President elect Trump&#x2019;s pick as UN ambassador.

(Genya Savilov / AFP via Getty Images)Aerovironment&#x2019;s figures jumped from $40,000 a quarter to $230,000 the first quarter of 2024, though that figured has dropped to $130,000 since. Anduril, meanwhile, dropped $210,000 on lobbying in Q4 2021. In Q3 2024, that number was up to $490,000. The Lobbying Disclosure Act&#x2019;s definitions of what qualifies as lobbying are surprisingly limited, so these figures are a low limit for these companies&#x2019; spending on government interactions. &#x201C;I hate to say that intent is important to me, but it is,&#x201D; says Sardoch. &#x201C;If you&apos;re testing (in Ukraine) in order to provide better products to Ukraine to mess Russia up a little better, great. If you&apos;re going in there to do that so that you can sell it to the South Koreans, saying &#x2018;hey, this will help you defend your country, look, we went and tested it in Ukraine,&#x2019; using Ukraine as a tagline, or using Ukraine as an advertising tool, that&apos;s a problem.&#x201D; Acuna summarized U.S. drone makers&#x2019; intentions succinctly. &#x201C;They do not offer competitive cost-effective solutions and they ain&#x2019;t trying out for the Ukrainian team. They are looking to get DoD contracts.&#x201D;	https://kyivindependent.com/battle-tested-in-ukraine-how-us-drone-makers-turned-ukraine-into-a-tagline-to-sell-west/	2024-11-18T07:21:04-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2159781855.jpg
Opinion: What Trump’s past statements reveal about the future of US-Ukraine relations	Ukraine and the rest of Europe anxiously followed the U.S. presidential election results on Nov. 6, which ultimately reported Donald Trump and J.D. Vance as the winners, with the Republican Party also securing majorities in the House and Senate. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly called the president-elect to offer congratulations and express interest in strengthening ties. But what does a Trump-Vance administration mean for Europe and Ukraine? Looking at past actions and campaign statements may provide insight. During his 2016-2020 term, Trump&#x2019;s stance toward NATO and Ukraine often raised eyebrows. He called NATO &#x201C;obsolete&#x201D; and argued that the U.S. should not be the world&#x2019;s police force. Trump withdrew American soldiers from Europe and opposed expanding the U.S. military presence there. He declined to fully endorse NATO&#x2019;s Article 5, which commits members to collective defense, and former aides reported that Trump even considered pulling out of the alliance. Trump&#x2019;s views on Ukraine also emerged during the 2016 election when he accused Ukraine of interfering in the U.S. election against him &#x2014; a claim later disproven by the FBI. Then, in 2019, he withheld defense assistance to Ukraine and requested that Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) later ruled that withholding aid passed by Congress was illegal. The House of Representatives impeached Trump, though the Senate ultimately acquitted him. After losing the 2020 election, Trump vowed a political comeback and eventually secured the 2024 Republican nomination. During his campaign, Trump&#x2019;s positions on NATO and Ukraine remained unchanged &#x2014; and even hardened. At a recent rally, Trump reiterated that NATO members must meet the 2% defense spending threshold, stating he would not protect allies who fail to do so. &quot;You don&#x2019;t pay your bills, you get no protection,&quot; he said. Trump suggested he would let Russia &quot;do whatever the hell they want&quot; if a country falls short on payments. Many former officials from the Trump-Pence administration believe Trump is likely to withdraw from NATO, jeopardizing European security. A woman holds a sign saying &quot;Trump will end the Ukraine war&quot; at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. on July 17, 2024. (Patrick T. Fallon /AFP via Getty Images)Regarding Ukraine, Trump pledged to end the war in one day by forcing Ukrainian officials to negotiate with Russia and cede territory. He has argued that U.S. aid to Ukraine is excessive and has called for cuts. Now, with the election behind him, Trump is expected to push for a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine that would likely reduce U.S. support. Trump has also said he would seek to delay Ukraine&#x2019;s NATO membership bid. Vance shares Trump&#x2019;s critical views on NATO and Ukraine. He has argued that European countries should handle their own security issues without U.S. involvement. Vance, who has opposed every bill supporting Ukraine since Russia&#x2019;s invasion, has said he &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t really care&#x201D; about Ukraine and that the U.S. should stop its aid. He also opposes Ukraine&#x2019;s potential NATO membership, arguing it should remain neutral. With Republicans in control of Congress, Trump and Vance will find support for their isolationist policies. House Speaker Mike Johnson, for example, has called on Europe to take more responsibility for its own security and suggested that NATO allies increase their defense spending. Johnson also backs Trump&#x2019;s forced peace plan for Ukraine, stating he does &#x201C;not have an appetite for further Ukraine funding&#x201D; and expressing confidence that Trump can end the war by pushing for negotiations with Russia. While most Senate Republicans support NATO and aid to Ukraine, their stance could clash with Trump, Vance, and Johnson&#x2019;s agenda. These differences could lead to friction between the White House, House, and Senate. The Trump-Vance administration is poised to reduce U.S. involvement in NATO and foreign conflicts. Trump, Vance, and Johnson argue that the U.S. has done enough for Ukraine and Europe. They intend to work with Russia on a peace agreement that may require Ukraine to adopt neutrality and forego NATO membership. In other words, Europe and Ukraine may soon find themselves without U.S. support. Facing Russian aggression alone, European nations and Ukraine will have to strengthen their cooperation and resilience amid an increasingly uncertain future. Only time will reveal whether they will succeed.

Ukraine's GDP grows by 4.2% in 10 months of 2024	Ukraine&#x2019;s economy grew by 4.2% year-on-year in the first 10 months of 2024 thanks to the construction, transportation, and manufacturing sectors, the country&apos;s Economy Ministry said on Nov. 18. The 4.2% growth aligns with earlier government forecasts. Russia&apos;s invasion caused a major hit to Ukraine&apos;s economy, which suffered a whopping 29.1% fall in GDP in 2022. Recovery programs aimed at rebuilding damaged and destroyed housing boosted the construction industry, fueling the growth. The transportation and manufacturing sectors were also among the drivers, mainly thanks to the restored Black Sea trade corridor and increased defense production, respectively, First Deputy Economy Minister Oleksii Sobolev said in a statement. Ukraine&apos;s GDP grew by 1.3% between October 2023 and the same month this year. According to the ministry, this figure was negatively affected by a lower-than-usual output of agriculture this time of the year due to an early harvest. &quot;By October, farmers had already finished harvesting some crops,&quot; the ministry said. The economy stabilized faster than expected in 2023 due to several successful government programs, as well as international support, and grew by 5.3% in 2023. In July 2024, the Economy Ministry reported a 4.1% growth over the past six months compared to the first six months of 2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-gdp-grows-by-4/	2024-11-18T06:49:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/Dream-4.jpg
Opinion: With Trump back, Europe can’t afford to guess on sanctions against Russia	The implications of Donald Trump&#x2019;s imminent return to the White House on Russia&#x2019;s illegal war in Ukraine are being minutely dissected. Will he deliver on his boast that he can end the war within 24 hours? How will he do that &#x2014; if he can? At what cost to the long-suffering citizens of Ukraine? And how should Ukraine&#x2019;s European allies anticipate and respond to whatever the new president &#x2014; with all his unpredictability &#x2014; chooses to do? One area that will inevitably draw attention in any future Trump strategy on Ukraine is the continued imposition and enforcement of sanctions on Russia&#x2019;s ability to fund and resource its full-scale invasion. What might we expect, and how should Ukraine and its European allies prepare? The first important point to note is that Trump is no stranger to sanctions and other coercive economic tools of statecraft. During his first presidency, he used sanctions aggressively against Iran, pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), which provided some nuclear-related sanctions relief for Iran, and doubled down on sanctions in his &#x201C;maximum pressure&#x201D; campaign against Tehran. Other countries, such as Venezuela and North Korea, also saw an uptick in U.S. sanctions. Of course, Trump&#x2019;s addiction to tariffs was also on display. Second, Trump&#x2019;s love of deals, his desire to win and not appear weak, and his obsession with &#x201C;value for money&#x201D; for the American people are likely to play an important role in his future use of sanctions on Russia. Based on these criteria, it is not certain that, even if he could roll back sanctions on Russia, he necessarily would. For the U.S., sanctions on Russia are an almost costless tool given the limited connection between the U.S. and Russian economies; imposing sanctions allows Trump to look tough and support his drive for whatever deal he wants to secure with the Kremlin. Third, the U.S. legislative landscape may hamper his ability to lift sanctions unilaterally. For example, the 2017 Countering America&#x2019;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) places certain restrictions on the president&#x2019;s ability to lift sanctions on Russia &#x2014; something Trump acknowledged during his previous term in the White House, noting that signing CAATSA into law would restrict his ability &#x201C;to strike good deals&#x201D; for the American people. But whatever transpires, European nations must assume that the transatlantic coordination and collaboration that has worked so well on the design, implementation, and enforcement of sanctions on Russia since February 2022 may not continue. So, what should Brussels and London do? European Commissioner President Ursula von der Leyen holds a press conference during a European Union summit in Brussels, Belgium, on March 23, 2023. (John Thys / AFP via Getty Images)The first point to acknowledge is that across Europe, the commitment to sanctions against Russia remains strong, despite nearly three years of effort. The lessons from 2014 have been learned. As European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted in an address to the Verkhovna Rada in November 2023, &#x201C;we shall not repeat the mistakes of 2014. And we will continue to apply maximum pressure against Russia, until the end of the aggression, until Ukraine has re-established a just peace.&#x201D; As von der Leyen begins a new term as Commission president, with key sanctions staff such as EU Sanctions Envoy David O&#x2019;Sullivan still in place, and with Poland taking on the presidency of the Council of the EU from January 2025, there is no doubt that the EU&#x2019;s commitment to sanctions will remain visible and strong. The same is true of the new government in London, where Sir Keir Starmer and his foreign secretary see cross-channel collaboration on sanctions as a key opportunity for rapprochement with Brussels. But rhetoric will not, by itself, suffice. Despite the scale of sanctions imposed on Russia, spiraling inflation, and an overheating economy, the Kremlin continues to secure the funding and resources it needs. With this in mind, and particularly if the U.S. becomes an unreliable partner, Europe needs to learn from Washington and adopt a far more muscular approach to its application of sanctions, leveraging its extensive trade relations with third countries and the use of the euro and pound sterling. This will require Europe to accelerate its domestic enforcement efforts and ensure the sanctions criminalization directive is swiftly enacted and enforced. It will also require diplomatic dialogue with third countries facilitating circumvention, balanced with jeopardy for those countries &#x2014; and, importantly, their private sector actors &#x2014; that choose to continue to fund and resource Russia&#x2019;s military. Finally, it calls for a more proactive, intelligence-led mindset among those charged with ensuring sanctions effectiveness. Europe has had three years to get match-fit on sanctions, and while the application of sanctions may be a marathon, not a sprint, changes in the White House mean that Europe can no longer jog behind Uncle Sam. It&#x2019;s time for Europe to shed its timidity and show what it has learned. Anything less will be a betrayal of the Ukrainian people at a time when they need Europe more than ever.

Zelensky visits key front-line town of Pokrovsk	President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, currently lying some 6-7 kilometers from the front line, his Telegram channel reported on Nov. 18. Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in the east, has come into artillery and drone range of Russian forces moving relentlessly forward in Donetsk Oblast. With Moscow&apos;s troops drawing near, losing the town would be a serious blow to other parts of the front line&apos;s defense as well. &quot;A tense sector. It is only thanks to the strength of the soldiers that the east (of Ukraine) is not completely occupied by Russia. The enemy receives a response every day,&quot; &#xA0;Zelensky said. 0:00/1&#xD7;President Volodymyr Zelensky visits Pokrovsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Nov. 18, 2024. (Presidential Office)The head of state also visited the base of the 25th Airborne Brigade and handed out awards to soldiers. During his trip, Zelensky was accompanied by Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin, who called Pokrovsk &quot;one of the hottest spots&quot; of the front line. Zelensky has previously visited the most critical sectors of the front line during the full-scale war, including now Russian-occupied Bakhmut or Avdiivka. His visit aims to boost the morale among Ukrainian troops, who are increasingly on the back foot in the face of a Russian advance. The inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in January adds further uncertainty regarding the future of Ukrainian defense capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-visits-pokrovsk/	2024-11-18T06:19:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Zelensky-Pokrovsk.jpeg
Scholz's stance on Taurus unchanged despite US permission on long-range strikes	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is not planning to supply Ukraine with Taurus missiles despite the U.S. easing restrictions on long-range strikes, a government spokesperson told the AFP news agency on Nov. 18. Scholz has &quot;made his position clear&quot; on the matter and will &quot;not change his stance anymore,&quot; spokesperson Wolfgang Buchner said. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use long-range U.S. arms against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this concerns ATACMS missiles to be deployed against Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Ukraine has previously received U.S.-made ATACMS and Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles from the U.K. and France, with a range of 300 kilometers (190 miles) and 250 kilometers (150 miles), respectively. In contrast, Scholz has been adamant about not supplying the Taurus cruise missiles, which boast a range of 500 kilometers (310 miles), fearing an escalation with Russia. Berlin&apos;s policy may soon shift as Germany heads toward snap elections on Feb. 23, with the center-right opposition alliance CDU/CSU currently leading the polls and threatening to oust Scholz. CDU/CSU&apos;s chancellor candidate, Friedrich Merz, said he would allow the delivery of Taurus missiles, but only if necessary after issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin and lifting restrictions on arms that had already been provided. Similarly, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who is running for the Chancellery for the Greens, said he would greenlight the delivery of the missiles if elected in February.	https://kyivindependent.com/scholz-taurus-long-range-strikes/	2024-11-18T05:10:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2175014888.jpg
Zelensky to present resilience plan to Ukrainian MPs 'in coming days,' media reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky will present his &quot;internal resilience plan&quot; to lawmakers as early as Nov. 19, Ukrainska Pravda reported on Nov. 18, citing sources from the ruling Servant of the People party. The 10-point plan will address the front-line situation, the military-industrial complex, the economy and finance, regional development, and other strategic sectors. The outlet wrote that Zelensky will present the plan &quot;in the coming days,&quot; with his speech preliminarily planned for Nov. 19. The government&apos;s latest plan will focus on internal solutions and is not an alternative to the five-point victory plan oriented toward Kyiv&apos;s international partners. &quot;There are 10 points in total, which will be presented next week, and for each point, together with Ukrainian civil society, together with everyone who is ready to add rational ideas, with business, we will prepare a basic, doctrinal document for Ukraine, for our sustainability,&quot; Zelensky said on Nov. 14. Facing Russian military advances and increasingly uncertain Western support, Zelensky previously pitched to Ukraine and its allies a five-step victory plan containing steps that should supposedly end the war by 2025. Some points of the plan met with a lukewarm response from partners, with several countries resisting key steps like a NATO invitation for Ukraine.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-to-present-resilience-plan-to-ukrainian-mps/	2024-11-18T04:34:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/Zelensky.jpeg
Biden administration aims to 'provoke further escalation' — Kremlin comments on long-range strikes	The outgoing U.S. administration intends to provoke an escalation of the war in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media on Nov. 18 following reports that Washington eased restrictions on long-range strikes. Several media outlets reported on Nov. 17 that U.S. President Joe Biden permitted Ukraine to use its ATACMS missiles to strike against targets on Russian soil. According to some reports, this so far concerns only Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. &quot;You know, with the reports in Western media, it is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps... to add fuel to the fire and continue to provoke further escalation of tensions,&quot; Peskov said, according to the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The statement comes as Biden is set to leave office in January, with Donald Trump replacing him in the Oval Office. The Biden administration has pledged to deliver as much support to Ukraine as possible before Trump takes office. Several Russian lawmakers called the step an escalation that could &quot;lead to World War III&quot; and the end of Ukrainian statehood. Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously said that long-range strikes against Russia with Western arms would mean NATO&apos;s involvement in the war, adding that Moscow is preparing &quot;various responses&quot; to such a step. Biden has been long adamant about not allowing Western-supplied weapons to be used on Russian soil, fearing an escalation. He first eased the restrictions in May to allow Ukraine to use certain weaponry like HIMARS to strike at Russian troops just across the border in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision, said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. As the decision came in the last months of Biden&apos;s term in office, it remains unclear whether Trump will uphold the policy after he returns to the White House.	https://kyivindependent.com/kremlin-long-range-strikes/	2024-11-18T03:59:21-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/07/GettyImages-1245735181.jpeg
Germany to provide Ukraine with 4,000 AI-powered 'Mini-Taurus' drones, Bild reports	Ukraine is set to receive new German-developed AI-powered kamikaze drones in the coming weeks, the German tabloid Bild reported on Nov. 18. The German government is reportedly funding a contract concluded in September between the Munich-based tech defense firm Helsing and Ukraine for the supply of 4,000 attack drones. Drones are an increasingly vital capability on Ukrainian battlefields. Russia has widely used kamikaze drones like Iranian Shaheds to target Ukrainian cities and infrastructure or domestically-made Lancets against Kyiv&apos;s troops. The previously top-secret high-tech drones have been nicknamed &quot;Mini-Taurus&quot; in reference to Germany&apos;s powerful cruise missiles, which Berlin refused to supply to Ukraine. According to Bild&apos;s source, the drone can &quot;orient&quot; itself in the terrain and is resistant to GPS jamming. After the operator orders a strike on a target, the aerial vehicle can fly to it independently, even when the radio connection is lost. #ScoopGermany delivers 4.000 &#x201C;#MiniTaurus&#x201D; strike drones to Ukraine.Comparable to the American SwitchBlade and the Russian Lancet, the &#x201C;Helsing&#x201D; product is cheaper, can fly longer and uses terrain matching AI for its entire cruise and terminal guidance.All exclusive details&#x2935;&#xFE0F; https://t.co/1kFDzkSTQt The drone boasts four times the range of kamikaze drones used by the Ukrainian military and carries warheads powerful enough to destroy Russian tanks, the outlet writes. It is also said to be comparably cheaper than foreign equivalents, like U.S.-made Switchblades or Russian Lancets. The weapons are reportedly being tested and improved &quot;under real operational conditions&quot; in eastern Ukraine. Full-scale deliveries are expected in December, with hundreds to be delivered per month. The supply of the new drones was confirmed for the outlet by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. In the wake of the latest Russian mass attack against Ukraine on Nov. 17, the minister told Bild he was &quot;very happy that the delivery of these AI-powered strike drones is starting right now.&quot; Helsing signed a memorandum with Ukraine on cooperation in the field of defense technology in February 2024. The company has been active in Ukraine since 2022. In October, France announced that it would deliver newly developed Colibri project kamikaze drones to Kyiv, further boosting Ukraine&apos;s drone capabilities.	https://kyivindependent.com/mini-taurus-bild/	2024-11-18T03:26:45-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2158978909.jpg
Turkish president to propose freezing Ukraine front line, Bloomberg reports	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will propose his peace plan for Ukraine during the G20 talks commencing on Nov. 18, Bloomberg reported, citing undisclosed sources. Erdogan&apos;s proposal would include Ukraine foregoing joining NATO for at least 10 years, freezing the current front line, providing Ukraine with weapons, and deploying international troops to a demilitarized buffer zone in the Donbas, Bloomberg reported. The Turkish leader&apos;s proposal comes as NATO countries prepare for a Donald Trump presidency, which many fear will lead to the U.S. pressuring Ukraine to end the war quickly, even at the cost of territorial concessions. The G20 countries are set to convene in Brazil without the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brazil is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin last year for the abduction of Ukrainian children. &#x200C;&#x200C; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also not be present, despite numerous appeals to receive an invitation.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky said on Nov. 16 that Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means in 2025.&#x200C;&#x200C; Zelensky&apos;s words followed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&#x2019;s phone conversation with Putin, during which he condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine and called to withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &quot;just and lasting peace.&quot; The call sparked anger in Ukraine, with Zelensky saying it could open a &quot;Pandora&apos;s Box&quot; for further engagement with the Russian leader. In the wake of Trump&apos;s election, Kyiv has urged its partners to adopt a &quot;peace through strength&quot; approach to pressure Russia toward a just peace.	https://kyivindependent.com/erdogan-peace-plan/	2024-11-18T03:02:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/08/GettyImages-1410425074.jpg
Russia launches missile attack on Odesa, casualties reported	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russian forces launched a missile attack against the port city of Odesa on Nov. 18, killing and injuring people, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Residential buildings were damaged in the attack, the governor said. The number of casualties and the full extent of damage are being determined. The attack occurred shortly after Russia launched one of its largest mass strikes against Ukraine on Nov. 17 and deadly missile attacks against the city of Sumy overnight on Nov. 18.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-missile-attack/	2024-11-18T02:41:30-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1587644884.jpg
German Greens chancellor candidate says he would send Taurus to Ukraine if elected	The German Greens&apos; candidate for chancellor, incumbent Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, told the ARD television channel on Nov. 17 that if elected, he would greenlight the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. &quot;The answer to this question is: yes!&quot; said Habeck in response to a question about whether he would authorize the missiles&apos; delivery. The vice chancellor has served as the economy minister in a coalition government with Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s Social Democrats and, until recently, the FDP liberals. Germany is heading toward snap elections on Feb. 23, 2025, after Scholz fired FDP&apos;s Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leading to the coalition&apos;s collapse. German assistance to Ukraine, which has become a topic of the electoral campaign, is increasingly crucial amid fears that the U.S. might withdraw its support after Donald Trump&apos;s recent election victory. Berlin is Ukraine&apos;s second-largest military donor under Scholz, but the chancellor has been adamant about not providing Taurus missiles, fearing it could draw his country into the war. Habeck said in the interview that deciding on arms deliveries has been part of his job as the economy minister, adding that those &quot;were some of the most difficult decisions (he) had to make.&quot; The German-Swedish air-launched Taurus missiles have a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles), which is more than the ATACMS or Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles provided to Ukraine by the U.S., the U.K., and France. Friedrich Merz, the chancellor candidate of the opposition center-right CDU/CSU alliance, also said he would allow the delivery of Taurus missiles but only after issuing an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin and lifting restrictions on already provided arms. CDU/CSU is currently leading the polls with 33%, followed by the Russian-friendly, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) with 18%, the Social Democrats at 16%, and the Greens with 11%.	https://kyivindependent.com/habeck-taurus/	2024-11-18T01:52:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2185227954--1-.jpg
Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 18, injure more than 100 over past day	Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 18 civilians and injured at least 108 over the past day, including children, regional authorities reported on Nov. 18. Ukrainian forces shot down eight of the 11 drones launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force said. Russian forces also reportedly attacked Sumy Oblast with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and a Kh-59 aerial guided missile. Russia launched multiple missile attacks on the city of Sumy overnight, targeting residential areas. Eleven people were killed, including two children, the regional military administration reported. Eighty-four people were injured in Russian overnight attacks against the city, including 11 children, authorities said. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, two people were killed, and six people were injured during the day on Nov. 17, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Attacks against the Nikopol district with drones and artillery killed a 58-year-old man and a 62-year-old woman. Three women aged 67, 72, and 57, and two men aged 40 and 32 were injured. A high-rise building, a transport company building, a medical facility, and other buildings and civilian infrastructure sites were damaged. A 45-year-old man was also injured and hospitalized with shrapnel wounds following a Russian attack against the Synelnykove district, Lysak said. Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast injured one person in the town of Siversk, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. Three people were injured during Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. An 84-year-old man was injured in the village of Hlushkivka, and two women aged 50 and 65 were injured in the town of Kupiansk. Four people were killed, and 10 were injured in Russian attacks overnight and on Nov. 17 in Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. One more person &#x2013; a 46-year-old man &#x2013; was killed during an attack in the morning of Nov. 18, according to the governor. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, three women aged 52, 55, and 61, as well as a 59-year-old man, were injured during attacks against the Polohy district, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, and Kyiv oblasts also came under attack, but no casualties were reported.	https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-105/	2024-11-18T00:49:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Sumy-Nov-18.jpg
Step toward World War III,' Russian MPs say after long-ranke strike permission reports	Senior Russian lawmakers threatened on Nov. 17 that outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s decision to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory with ATACMS missiles could lead to World War III and the loss of Ukrainian statehood. &quot;This is a very big step towards the start of World War III,&quot; lawmaker Vladimir Dzhabarov said, according to Russia&#x2019;s state-owned TASS state news agency. Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy, several media outlets reported on Nov. 17. Ukraine will likely initially use the missiles against Russian and North Korean forces in Kursk Oblast, but Washington could also authorize their use elsewhere, undisclosed official sources told the New York Times. The decision has not been publicly confirmed by Kyiv or Washington, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that the &quot;missiles will speak for themselves.&quot; &quot;The West has decided on a level of escalation that could end with the remnants of Ukraine completely losing their statehood,&quot; Andrei Klishas, a member of Russia&#x2019;s Federation Council, wrote on his Telegram channel. The Kremlin has yet to comment officially on the latest reports. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously said that long-range strikes against Russia with Western arms would mean NATO&apos;s involvement in the war, adding that Moscow is preparing &quot;various responses&quot; to such a step. Russia has repeatedly set supposed &quot;red lines&quot; on Western assistance for Ukraine, sometimes accompanied by veiled or overt nuclear threats. The policy change follows Biden&apos;s previous hesitance to provide such weapons out of concern for escalating tensions with Russia. While U.S. officials do not expect this move to &quot;change the overall course of the war,&quot; Biden reportedly aims to help Ukraine target critical Russian and North Korean military assets and send a deterrent message to Pyongyang, the New York Times wrote. Proponents of the decision have long argued that this authorization would significantly enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities, especially with Russia ramping up military offensives on many fronts and intensifying drone and missile attacks in recent months.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-mps-long-range/	2024-11-18T00:01:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2030058312.jpg
Russian drones, missiles violate Moldova's airspace during strike on Ukraine, Chisinau says	Russia&#x2019;s large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17 also violated Moldovan airspace, Moldova&apos;s foreign minister said on X on Nov. 17. Russia&#x2019;s latest large-scale aerial attack left at least seven civilians dead and around 20 injured across multiple regions, targeting power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine, authorities said. &quot;We strongly condemn the violation of Moldova&#x2019;s airspace by Russia&#x2019;s missiles and drones targeting Ukraine&#x2019;s critical infrastructure today,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mihai Popsoi said.

In a video attached to his post, a house is seen with an increasingly loud sound of a jet engine, claimed to be a Russian projectile. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims. Popsoi&#x2019;s reaction was the latest in a long row of diplomatic spat between Moldova and Russia, with the former handing a note of protest to the newly appointed Russian ambassador on Nov. 12. over Russian interference in the recent presidential election and the crashing of two Russian drones on Moldovan territory earlier. Similar incidents of Russian drones or missiles entering a third country&apos;s airspace during attacks on Ukraine have been reported by Romania, Poland, and Latvia.	https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-russian-drones-missiles/	2024-11-17T23:24:17-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/07/GettyImages-2152827912.jpg
Missiles will speak for themselves' — Zelensky reacts to long-range strike permission reports	President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on Nov. 17 on recent reports that the U.S. eased restrictions on long-range strikes within Russia, saying that &quot;such things are not announced.&quot; The president made the statement shortly after the New York Times reported that the Biden administration had permitted the use of U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles across the border, namely against Russian and North Korean forces amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. The report has not been publicly confirmed by Washington or Kyiv. &quot;Today, there&#x2019;s a lot of talk in the media about us receiving permission for respective actions,&quot; Zelensky said in his evening address. &quot;But strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves.&quot; The decision would come as a major shift in U.S. policy as President Joe Biden has been long adamant about not allowing Western-supplied weapons to be used on Russian soil, fearing an escalation. Biden first eased the restrictions in May to allow Ukraine to use certain weaponry like HIMARS to strike at Russian troops just across the border in the wake of the Kharkiv offensive.

Nordic countries equipping citizens with pamphlets offering advice in case of war	The governments of Norway, Sweden, and Finland have begun the distribution of informative pamphlets to citizens, providing them with advice in case of the outbreak of war or other emergency situations, BBC reported on Nov. 17. Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine exacerbated fears among neighboring countries of a potential open conflict between Moscow and NATO. Citizens of Sweden will begin to receive pamphlets in the mail on Nov. 18, providing basic information on a &quot;worsening security situation&quot; amid Russia&apos;s ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, both Finland and Norway also provided pamphlets to its citizens. Helsinki provided a virtual pamphlet, as opposed to a physical copy, in an effort to save taxpayer money, while Oslo distributed 2.2 million paper pamphlets, &quot;one for each household in Norway,&#x201D; according to a spokesperson for Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection, the BBC reported. The advice provided in the pamphlets &#x2014; which have been reprinted and updated from earlier versions &#x2014; provides basic survival information, including information on meals and medicines, while stressing that the Nordic countries are prepared for &quot;self-defense&quot; in case of a war. &#x201C;If Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up. All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false,&#x201D; Stockholm&apos;s advice reads. Both Sweden and Finland joined the NATO alliance in the two years following Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Both countries abandoned their non-alignment policy, concerned that they may become a target of Russia&apos;s expansionist ambitions. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova previously threatened Sweden in February 2024 saying there would be a Russian response to the country&apos;s then-prospects of joining NATO, but did not clarify what it would entail. Russian President Vladimir Putin also made similar vague threats to Finland after it joined the alliance, saying in December 2023 that Finland is &quot;now going to have problems&quot; because it joined NATO. NATO militaries have strengthened their capacity and preparedness since the beginning of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the prospect of the war escalating to an all-out clash between the alliance and Russia has so far been averted, there are concerns that the West has not truly accepted that it may still be a possibility. In Lithuania, the LRT public broadcaster reported on July 25, citing the country&apos;s Interior Ministry, that the country&apos;s authorities are drawing up plans for mass evacuations of civilians in case of an armed conflict. Several NATO commanders and other alliance leaders have warned in increasingly stark terms in recent months about the dangers of such a war and what impact it could have across Europe.	https://kyivindependent.com/nordic-countries-equipping-citizens-with-information-advice-in-case-of-war/	2024-11-17T21:28:01-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/12/GettyImages-1839741170.jpg
Multiple drones shot down on outskirts of Moscow, mayor claims	Russian air defense intercepted multiple drones on the outskirts of Moscow, the city&apos;s mayor, Sergey Sobyanin, said overnight on Nov. 18. At least one drone was shot down over the Ramensky district of the city, while another was downed over the Pavlovsky Posad district around 4:30 a.m. local time, Sobyanin claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify Sobyanin&apos;s claims, and Ukraine&apos;s military has not yet commented on the attack. The alleged attack on the Russian capital comes one night after Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack on different cities across Ukraine, leaving seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured. In recent months, Russia has continued to increase its use of attack drones, targeting cities and towns across Ukraine on a near daily basis since the start of September. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. Ukraine has previously hit targets within Russia, aiming primarily at the country&apos;s oil infrastructure and defense industry. On Nov. 10, Russian air defense shot down 70 Ukrainian drones, including 34 in Moscow Oblast, in Ukraine&#x2019;s largest drone attack on the Russian capital. At least one person was reported injured in Moscow Oblast in that attack. The day before the largest attack on Moscow, Russia launched its own largest overnight drone attack on Ukraine on Nov. 9-10, with 145 drones entering Ukrainian airspace.	https://kyivindependent.com/multiple-drones-shot-down-on-outskirts-of-moscow-mayor-claims/	2024-11-17T19:41:51-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/06/GettyImages-1259010576.jpg
Trump Jr. ridicules US decision to authorize Ukraine to target Russia with long-range missiles	President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s son, Donald Trump Jr., ridiculed U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s decision to authorize Kyiv&apos;s use of U.S.-supplied long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia. According to media reports, Biden authorized the decision on Nov. 17, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy. Unnamed U.S. officials, as well as a source familiar with the decision, who spoke to Reuters following the decision said that Kyiv plans to conduct its first long-range strikes in the coming days. While reposting a news item of the policy change on X, Trump Jr. referred to the Biden administration as &quot;imbeciles&quot; for allowing the decision to go forward. The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives. Gotta lock in those $Trillions. Life be damned!!! Imbeciles! https://t.co/ZzfwnhBxRh &quot;The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,&quot; Trump Jr. wrote. President-elect Trump has repeatedly criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine, calling President Volodymyr Zelensky &quot;the greatest salesman on earth&quot; and vowing to get the U.S. &quot;out&quot; of the war as soon as possible. Trump also led congressional Republicans to obstruct aid to Kyiv in a drawn-out legislative battle while Ukrainians on the front lines suffered an ammunition shortage. While Donald Trump Jr. does not hold a formal position within his father&apos;s White House transition team, President-elect Trump has been known to regularly consult family members on a number policy decisions. Trump Jr. has previously taunted Ukrainian officials on social media, having shared an Instagram clip on Nov. 10 mocking President Volodymyr Zelensky and indicating that Ukraine would soon lose aid from the United States. Another incoming Trump administration official, billionaire Elon Musk, also mocked on Nov. 16 Zelensky for saying that Ukraine is an independent country that cannot be forced to &quot;sit and listen.&quot; It was not immediately clear if President-elect Trump will reverse Biden&apos;s decision on Kyiv&apos;s use of long-range missiles as neither Trump nor his transition team have commented on the move.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-jr-ridicules-us-decision-to-authorize-ukraine-to-target-russia-with-us-long-range-missiles/	2024-11-17T18:57:24-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2162154614.jpg
Finnish foreign minister urges Western leaders to refrain from calling Putin, calls for coordinated communication with Kremlin	Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen urged Western leaders to refrain from making additional phone calls to Russian President Vladimir Putin following German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s recent call, Valtonen said on German TV on Nov. 17. &quot;The most important thing is that we understand we must not engage in another race for attention from the Kremlin right now,&quot; Valtonen said on ARD. &quot;It won&#x2019;t help if the leaders of European states make coordinated or uncoordinated phone calls with Putin,&quot;Valtonen added, urging Western cooperation with Kyiv on the matter. Scholz spoke with Putin on Nov. 15 for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&#x2019;s war, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. The call sparked anger in Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the conversation opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box&quot; for further engagement and that &quot;it is extremely important for Putin to loosen his isolation, Russia&apos;s isolation.&quot; The call drew a mixed reaction from Western leaders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated support for Scholz&apos;s phone call with Putin, though adding his trust in the Russian leader is &quot;at an all-time low.&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X that Western phone calls to the Kremlin will not stop Russian aggression. &quot;No-one will stop Putin with phone calls. The attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine,&quot; Tusk said. In defense of his conversation with Putin, Scholz told the media on Nov. 17 that the phone call was meant to dispel any illusions Putin might hold about the West withdrawing support for Ukraine. &quot;The conversation was very detailed but contributed to a recognition that little has changed in the Russian president&apos;s views of the war - and that&apos;s not good news,&quot; Scholz said, according to Sky News. He also added it would not be good if no European leader were in contact with Moscow if the new U.S. administration will be. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to swiftly end the war by bringing Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. His imminent return to the White House has also sparked fears that Washington might withdraw its support, forcing Europe and other partners to radically step up their contributions.	https://kyivindependent.com/finnish-foreign-minister-urges-western-leaders-to-refrain-from-calling-putin-calls-for-coordinated-communication-with-kremlin/	2024-11-17T17:16:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/--------------2024-05-29-165945.png
Russian attacks on Ukraine in October killed nearly 200, injured over 900 civilians	Russian attacks on various regions of Ukraine in October led to the deaths of 183 civilians and injured a further 903 people, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported. According a report issued by the monitoring mission, 80 per cent of the causalities were recorded along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front, particularly in Kherson, Kharkiv, and Donetsk oblasts. A total of nine children were killed in the attacks and a further 49 children injured. The report noted that 45 per cent of victims of the Russian attacks were over the age of 60. The casualties incurred in October were predominantly caused by aerial bombardment, artillery shelling, and drone and missile attacks. The mounting death toll among civilians comes as Russia continues to increase its use of attack drones, targeting cities and towns across Ukraine on a near daily basis since the start of September. President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 2 that Russia launched over 2,000 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in October. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. While missile attacks are a common occurrence in Ukraine&apos;s eastern oblasts, most Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, have largely been spared from large-scale Russian missile attacks on infrastructure in recent months. Russia missile bombardments began again on Nov. 17 with a mass aerial attack targeting major cities and energy infrastructure around the country. The latest attack left at least seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured across multiple regions.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-ukraine-in-october-killed-nearly-200-injured-over-900-civilians/	2024-11-17T14:43:38-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-2001069533.jpg
Russian attacks on Sumy kill 8, injure 49	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. On the evening of Nov. 17, a Russian ballistic missile hit Sumy, killing eight people and injuring at least 49, regional authorities reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack on Telegram. &#x201C;A rocket attack on a nine-story building in Sumy. We know about the dead and wounded, including children. My condolences to the families and friends. The criminal must be punished for killing innocent people,&#x201D; he said. The rocket also hit the yard of the building, causing extensive damage and leaving surrounding homes without windows, the city&apos;s acting mayor, Artem Kobzar, said. Emergency services are continuing to assist the victims, as local media report the ongoing impact of the attack. Russian strikes against Sumy Oblast have become increasingly destructive in recent months, amid fears that Russia may launch a new attack on Sumy Oblast in the coming months. Shelling is a daily occurrence for the communities near Ukraine&apos;s northeastern border with Russia, with residents in the region&apos;s vulnerable border settlements experiencing multiple attacks per day.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-attacks-on-sumy-kill-8-injure-49/	2024-11-17T13:19:07-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_1117.JPG
UK, France approve Ukraine's use of long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia, Le Figaro reports	France and the U.K. have granted Ukraine permission to conduct deep strikes into Russian territory using their SCALP and Storm Shadow missiles, Le Figaro reported on Nov. 17. This decision coincides with U.S. President Joe Biden&#x2019;s authorization for Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia, a significant shift in U.S. policy following months of hesitation. Ukraine had received several long-range systems from its partners, including U.S.-made ATACMS, French SCALP, and British Storm Shadow, but was not permitted to use them against targets within Russian territory. Ukraine&apos;s partner countries often cited fears of Russian escalation as a reason to withhold approval for firing the provided missiles. The changes in policy from the three countries were long-awaited. Proponents of the decision have long argued that this authorization would significantly enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities, especially with Russia increasing military offensives on many fronts, and intensifying drone and missile attacks in recent months. One of the aspects of Ukraine&apos;s victory plan included a request for greater numbers of ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles and permission to launch them against military targets in Russia, presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in comments published on Oct. 14. According to the advisor, permission to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory could ramp up domestic pressure in Russia, weaken Russian forces, and thus change Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s strategic calculus.	https://kyivindependent.com/uk-france-approve-ukraines-use-of-long-range-missiles-for-strikes-inside-russia-le-figaro-reports/	2024-11-17T11:58:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/05/scalp-10.004.jpg
NYT: Biden authorizes Ukraine to target Russia with US long-range missiles	U.S. President Biden has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles for strikes inside Russia, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy, the New York Times reported on Nov. 17. The decision comes as Russia, with the support of North Korean troops, prepares a large-scale assault on Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. While the U.S. officials do not expect this move to &#x201C;change the overall course of the war&#x201D;, Biden aims to help Ukraine target critical Russian and North Korean military assets and send a deterrent message to Pyongyang. The policy change follows Biden&apos;s previous hesitance to provide such weapons, out of concern for escalating tensions with Russia. Proponents of the decision have long argued that this authorization would significantly enhance Ukraine&#x2019;s defense capabilities, especially with Russia increasing military offensives on many fronts, and intensifying drone and missile attacks in recent months. The talks on loosening U.S. restrictions reportedly began after Defense Minister Rustem Umerov on Aug. 30 visited Washington and presented senior officials with a list of high-value targets in Russia that Ukraine wants to hit with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).	https://kyivindependent.com/nyt-biden-authorizes-ukraine-to-target-russia-with-us-long-range-missiles/	2024-11-17T10:51:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030058326.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Russia launches one of the largest aerial strikes on Ukraine, energy grid damage	Key developments on Nov. 16-17: Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17, leaving at least seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured across multiple regions. Multiple loud explosions were reported in the capital, Kyiv, between 6:30 and 7:15 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Russia&apos;s latest barrage of missile strikes marks the first mass missile attack on Kyiv in over 2 months, with Russia instead utilizing more frequent drone strikes in recent months to attack the capital. Further explosions were also heard in the cities of Kropyvnytskyi, Rivne, Ivano-Frankivsk, Cherkasy, Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Kryvyi Rih, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, as well as in the Khmelnytskyi and Volyn oblasts. Russia targeted &quot;power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;The transmission system operator has urgently introduced emergency shutdowns,&quot; Halushchenko said. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said that as a result of falling drone debris, an apartment on the fourth floor of a five-story residential building caught fire in the Pechersk neighborhood of the city. One person was hospitalized as a result of the attack, while one other person received medical treatment on-site. Debris was also reported in the Holosiivskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. Several residential and commercial buildings, a club building, and a library were damaged in the capital. A 45-year-old woman was injured in Kyiv Oblast, suffering a head wound, Governor Ruslan Kravchenko reported. Fallen debris damaged industrial facilities, 21 houses, and other buildings across the region. In addition to the attack on Kyiv, at least two people were killed and seven injured, including two children, in the city of Mykolaiv amid Russia&#x2019;s mass drone and missile attack, regional governor Vitalii Kim reported. In the city of Dnipro, a 42-year-old man suffered shrapnel wounds as a result of the attack. High-rise buildings, an educational institution, and a car were damaged, Governor Serhii Lysak reported. Russia also struck a railway depot in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, killing two railway workers and injuring three, Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) said on its Telegram channel. It is not immediately clear whether the number of injured includes the 42-year-old man reported previously by the governor. Critical infrastructure facilities were hit in the Vinnytsia, Odesa, and Volyn oblasts, leading to power outages and emergency shutdowns, regional authorities said. Odesa also faced problems with the water supply. Infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Two people were reported injured in the regional center, the city of Zaporizhzhia. A 59-year-old man was hospitalized, and an 18-year-old man received medical assistance on the spot, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. In Lviv Oblast, 12 garages caught fire due to fallen missile debris. A 66-year-old woman was killed in her car by the debris in the Sheptytskyi (formerly Chervonohrad) district, Governor Maksym Kozytskyi reported. Two more people were injured. Two people were killed, and a 17-year-old boy was injured in Odesa Oblast, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. One civilian was reportedly hospitalized with serious injuries in Poltava Oblast. An outbuilding and a house were damaged in Zhytomyr Oblast. Regional authorities also reported that a critical infrastructure site was damaged in Rivne Oblast, and a house was damaged by fallen debris in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. &quot;Cruise, ballistic, and air-launched ballistic missiles, Zirkons, Iskanders, Kinzhals. In total, around 120 missiles and 90 drones (were launched by Russia),&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said following the attack. This makes it one of the most massive strikes launched at Ukraine throughout the full-scale war. &quot;Our air defenses destroyed more than 140 aerial targets... We are grateful to our air defense forces involved in the attack, our aviation &#x2013; F-16, Sukhoi, and MiG pilots &#x2013; mobile fire groups, electronic warfare units, everybody worked in an organized manner,&quot; Zelensky said. In response to the mass attack, the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces scrambled fighter jets to protect the country&apos;s own airspace. &quot;Ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have reached the highest state of readiness,&quot; the Operational Command added. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued air raid alerts across all regions of the country around 6 a.m. local time, warning of the attack. The alert ended in much of Ukraine at around 9:30 a.m. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported earlier in the night that Tu-95 strategic bombers took off from the Russian airfields of Olenya in Murmansk Oblast. Later in the night, the War Monitor Telegram channel reported that a total of 17 Tu-95 strategic bombers were in flight, with seven taking off at the Engels airbase in Saratov Oblast. In recent months, Russia has primarily focused on large-scale drone attacks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses in cities across the country. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. While missile attacks are a common occurrence in Ukraine&apos;s eastern oblasts, most Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, have largely been spared from large-scale Russian missile attacks on infrastructure in recent months &#x2014; with the last large-scale missile attack occurring in late August. The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Nov. 15, citing three EU officials. The lethal aid in question reportedly refers to a Chinese firm&apos;s role in attack drone production for Russia in its war against Ukraine. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war. &quot;We have had reports from intelligence sources on the existence of a factory inside China producing drones which are shipped to Russia,&quot; a senior EU official told Politico on Nov. 15. The official told Politico that the EU has yet to determine whether Beijing is aware of the firm&apos;s drone production. China&apos;s foreign ministry has previously denied knowledge of the project. In a separate comment to FAZ, a EU diplomat acknowledged that while there is not any direct evidence to implicate Beijing in the drone production, the official said it was difficult &quot;to imagine that something like this would happen and the Chinese government wouldn&apos;t know anything about it at all.&quot; China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. In an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24., President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. Although it is unclear what concrete steps the EU will take in response to the reported drone production, implementing additional sanctions may be on the table for the European bloc &#x2014; including adding more Chinese companies to a list of firms facing EU sanctions, an EU diplomat told Politico. U.S. President Joe Biden is also expected to discuss China&apos;s support for Russia on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Peru on Nov. 16. According to the White House, Biden is expected to voice his &quot;deep concern&quot; regarding China&apos;s &quot;support for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.&quot; Russia recently began producing thermobaric drones to be used alongside decoy drones in Ukraine, which are capable of causing severe damage to civilians, an investigation by the Associated Press (AP) revealed on Nov. 16. While thermobaric warheads have reportedly been previously used by Russia in Ukraine on missiles, their use on attack drones would mark an escalation of the warhead&apos;s use. Thermobaric warheads create a wave of high pressure and heat that is capable of penetrating thick walls, AP reported. The damage caused by thermobaric attack drones would cause damage that would be &quot;simply terrifying&quot; for civilian populations to endure, including collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, and brain damage, according to a source familiar with Russian drone production. While controversial, thermobaric munitions are not prohibited under international law. According to the AP investigation, the thermobaric weapons would be deployed alongside decoy drones meant to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Decoy drones have been regularly used in recent months as Russia has increased its drone attack on Ukrainian cities since the beginning of September. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. The Russian production of thermobaric drones, codenamed Operation False Target, is currently in production in Russia&#x2019;s Alabuga Special Economic Zone in the country&apos;s Tatarstan Republic. Russia continues to use drones to overwhelm Ukrainian cities ahead of expected attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities ahead of the winter months. The use of thermobaric drones would likely be used primarily to penetrate thick walls and underground energy substation, ideal for targeting energy facilities. In recent months, Iran and China have continued to supply components for Russian attack drones. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine. While Iran has continuously produced Shahed-type drones for Russia&apos;s use in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers on Nov. 18, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported, citing three EU officials. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a key railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, disabling electrical equipment and causing disruptions to Russia&apos;s military supply chain, the group claimed on Nov. 16. An Atesh operative burned a relay cabinet near the Russian-occupied city of Tokmak, the partisans said, publishing purported footage of the sabotage without specifying the date. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. According to the group, the sabotage occurred between two rail stations in occupied Tokmak. 0:00/0:151&#xD7;Purported footage of a sabotage of a railway cabinet relay near the occupied city of Tokmak. Video published on Nov. 16 2024. (Atesh/Telegram) &quot;Russian forces are intensifying their offensive in the Zaporizhzhia direction. This makes sabotage operations a serious problem for them, complicating logistics and disrupting the regular supply of ammunition and fuel,&quot; the group said on Telegram. &quot;These interruptions gradually undermine the combat effectiveness of Russian troops, slow their offensive actions, and increase losses, ultimately reducing their chances of achieving their objectives,&quot; the group added. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Amid increased attacks in the region, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told the news outlet Suspilne on Nov. 12 that the Russian army is deploying trained assault groups to frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks in both occupied areas of Ukraine and inside Russia itself. On at least two different occasions, the saboteurs have previously claimed to attack rail lines inside Russia, targeting North Korean ammunition transported throughout the country. A drone strike damaged a factory on Nov. 17 in the Russian city of Izhevsk, more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the Ukrainian border, according to Alexander Brechalov, head of Russia&apos;s Udmurt Republic. The factory produces air defense systems, radars, and other equipment for the Russian military, said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;Uknown drones attacked the Izhevsk Electromechanical Plant Kupol in Russia. There, Russia produces the Tor air defense systems, as well as radars and other components,&quot; Kovalenko wrote on his Telegram channel. Brechalov reported an explosion and a &quot;drone crash&quot; at an unnamed &quot;factory workshop&quot; on the city&apos;s Lenina Street. One person was injured, and the crash damaged the facility&apos;s windows, the official claimed, adding that there &quot;was no serious damage.&quot; Citing local residents, the Russian Telegram channel Astra also reported that the 300th production unit of the Kupol defense plant, standing at the intersection of Lenina and 40 Let Pobedy streets, was targeted. The claims could not be independently verified. Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence (HUR) says it cannot provide any information at the moment in response to the Kyiv Independent&apos;s request for comment. Izhevsk is the regional center of the Udmurt Republic, lying in central Russia west of the Ural Mountains. This would mark the first drone attack against the region during the entire war. Throughout the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has carried out a number of long-range strikes deep inside Russian territory, primarily targeting the country&apos;s oil and defense industries.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-russia-launches-one-of-the-largest-aerial-strikes-on-ukraine-energy-grid-damage-eu-has-convincing-evidence-of-reported-chinese-attack-drone-production-for-russia/	2024-11-17T10:12:11-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239680001.jpg
The Week Ahead by KI Insights: What we're watching this week	Editor&apos;s note: This article is an on-site version of KI Insights&apos; The Week Ahead newsletter covering events from Nov. 18-Nov. 24. Sign up here to start your week with an agenda of Ukraine-related events, delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday.The G20 Summit will take place in Brazil on Nov. 18-19. Brazil aims to use the summit to position itself as a lead voice for Latin America and the Global South. Foreign Minister Lavrov will represent Russia (Brazil&#x2019;s Lula da Silva shifted responsibility over the ICC arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin). US President Joe Biden and China&#x2019;s leader Xi Jinping are both set to attend. The G20 summit comes on the heels of the APEC meeting in Peru. China was at the center of multiple major topics discussed: fighting protectionism (and looming &#x201C;Trump tariffs), Korean peninsula security (notably in light of North Korea&#x2019;s entering the war), and Brazil&#x2019;s economic pivot to Beijing. The Verkhovna Rada has scheduled a plenary week for Nov. 19-22, during which the adoption of the 2025 budget is planned. The budget hinges on the president signing the tax hike bill passed by parliament over a month ago (which may be further delayed by prospects of elections). The IMF mission currently in Ukraine emphasizes this necessity. However, the Rada committee meeting meant to approve the bill&apos;s final version was postponed from Friday to an unspecified date. Expect discussions on budget-connected issues next week: porn decriminalization (mostly as a distraction, but also for tax reasons), salaries for prosecutors and teachers, the road fund and local government finances, among others. A second reading vote may take place on a bill defining the legal status of military paramedics, and another one streamlining the procedure for writing off military property (which could simplify decommissioning of various drones and ground-based electronic warfare kit). The first round of Romania&apos;s presidential elections is set for Nov. 24. Current polls show Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu in the lead. Top contenders for the second round include Nicolae Ciuc&#x103; (PNL), George Simion (AUR), and Elena Lasconi (USR). Despite Ciolacu&apos;s lead, polls suggest these three have a real chance of advancing to the runoff. Ciolacu is a strong advocate for Ukraine, supporting its EU and NATO aspirations. The primary threat to Ukraine may be George Simion&apos;s potential advancement to the second round, given his far-right party&apos;s growing support. Simion is barred from entering Moldova and Ukraine for three years, partly due to suspected FSB connections. He staunchly opposes aid to Ukraine, especially military assistance. Reports indicate Russian interference attempts in the elections, involving the use of proxies and social media bot networks.

Ukrainian nuclear power plants lower output following Russian strikes, IAEA reports	Ukraine&#x2019;s nuclear power plants reduced their electricity production as a precautionary measure due to large-scale missile strikes targeting the country&#x2019;s energy infrastructure, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement on Nov. 17. The attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s infrastructure led to &#x201C;increased nuclear safety and security risks,&#x201D; Grossi said. While the Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and South Ukrainian plants remained operational and avoided direct hits, several substations critical to their power supply were damaged. Grossi emphasized the vulnerability of Ukraine&#x2019;s energy network and reiterated the importance of securing a reliable external power supply to nuclear facilities, a key IAEA safety principle. Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17, leaving at least seven civilians dead and at least 19 injured across multiple regions. Russia targeted &quot;power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-nuclear-power-plants-lower-output-following-russian-strikes-iaea-reports/	2024-11-17T09:22:23-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-1239680001.jpg
Russian opposition holds anti-war march in Berlin	A march organized by Russian opposition exiled leaders Yulia Navalnaya, Vladimir Kara-Murza, and Ilya Yashin in protest against Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin&apos;s regime began in Berlin on Nov. 17. The event&apos;s participants are calling for Russia&apos;s withdrawal from Ukraine, the release of political prisoners, and to try Putin as a war criminal, Deutsche Welle reported. The event, which had been planned in advance, took place the same day as Russia launched one of its largest strikes on Ukrainian cities and the energy grid, killing and injuring civilians. While the German police estimated the initial number of participants to be 1,800, the independent news outlet Meduza counted up to 6,000-7,000 people. The march moved from the Potsdamer Platz (Square) to the Brandenburg Gate, ending the procession at the nearby Russian embassy building. Navalnaya, Kara-Murza, and Yashin were in attendance. Russian opposition politicians in exile Yulia Navalnaya (C), Vladimir Kara-Murza (L), and Ilya Yashin (R) attend an anti-war demonstration they organized on Nov. 17, 2024, in Berlin, Germany. They were demanding an end to the rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an end to Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine. (Axel Schmidt/Getty Images)Navalnaya took up a more visible public role after the death of her husband, Alexei Navalny, in a Russian penal colony in February. She has directly accused Putin of being responsible for her husband&apos;s death. Kara-Murza and Yashin, who were jailed in Russia as political prisoners, were released on Aug. 1 in a large-scale prisoner swap between Moscow and the West. Videos shared by the media show participants waving both Ukrainian and blue-and-white Russian opposition flags and chanting &quot;No to war,&quot; &quot;Putin is a murderer,&quot; and &quot;Russia without Putin.&quot; Others held banners with pro-Ukrainian statements, such as &quot;Ukraine&apos;s victory is also ours&quot; and &quot;We stand with Ukraine.&quot; According to Deutsche Welle, an incident broke out when two participants brought the tricolor of the Russian Federation to the march, leading to angry protests from other demonstrators. &quot;Putin is not Russia. Russia is us. We are against the war, against aggression. We support free, peaceful Russia,&quot; Yashin said in a speech. Russian opposition leaders have denounced the war and Putin&apos;s regime but have also come under criticism from Ukraine for calling for reduced sanctions against Russia as a whole, urging instead more targeted measures against the leadership. Asked in an interview with the German outlet Zeit whether it is correct to supply arms to Ukraine, Navalnaya responded: &quot;It&apos;s difficult to say. The war was unleashed by Vladimir Putin, but the bombs are hitting Russians too.&quot; &quot;All Russian troops must be withdrawn from the territory of Ukraine immediately. The war must end immediately,&quot; she added. Oleksii Makeiev, Ukraine&apos;s ambassador to Germany, called the march &quot;dignified and inconsequential&quot; and a &quot;PR campaign whose target group is not the Russian population, but German media and politicians.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-opposition-holds-anti-war-march-in-berlin/	2024-11-17T07:40:53-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184593713.jpg
Canada's Trudeau signals support for Scholz-Putin call, Poland's Tusk says phone calls won't stop Russia	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated support for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though adding his trust in the Russian leader is &quot;at an all-time low,&quot; Bloomberg reported on Nov. 17. &quot;We all understand how important it is to see an end to the violence in Ukraine, to see an end to conflicts around the world,&quot; Trudeau told Bloomberg during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru, which took place between Nov. 15-16. &quot;That requires a level of engagement with counterparts who in many cases we disagree with.&quot; Scholz spoke with Putin on Nov. 15 for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&#x2019;s war, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. The call sparked anger in Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the conversation opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box&quot; for further engagement and that &quot;it is extremely important for Putin to loosen his isolation, Russia&apos;s isolation.&quot; Trudeau added that Canada and other partners are closely engaging with Zelensky and that &quot;it&apos;s a good thing that there are conversations around this, but the level of trust that I have for Vladimir Putin is probably at an all-time low right now.&quot; The phone call came under fresh criticism from Ukraine and elsewhere following a mass Russian drone and missile strike early on Nov. 17. &quot;No-one will stop Putin with phone calls. The attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine,&quot; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X. &quot;This is war criminal Putin&#x2019;s true response to all those who called and visited him recently. We need peace through strength, not appeasement,&quot; Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha commented. In his defense, Scholz told the media on Nov. 17 that the phone call was meant to dispel any illusions Putin might hold about the West withdrawing support for Ukraine. &quot;The conversation was very detailed but contributed to a recognition that little has changed in the Russian president&apos;s views of the war - and that&apos;s not good news,&quot; Scholz said, according to Sky News. He also added it would not be good if no European leader were in contact with Moscow if the new U.S. administration will be. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to swiftly end the war by bringing Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. His imminent return to the White House has also sparked fears that Washington might withdraw its support, forcing Europe and other partners to radically step up their contributions.	https://kyivindependent.com/canadas-pm-trudeau-signals-support-for-scholz-putin-call/	2024-11-17T06:41:19-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1683460359.jpg
Musk mocks Zelensky for comments about Ukraine's independence	Elon Musk, a billionaire and close ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, mocked on Nov. 16 President Volodymyr Zelensky for saying that Ukraine is an independent country that cannot be forced to &quot;sit and listen.&quot; Initially a supporter of Ukraine, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO and one of the world&apos;s richest people has made progressively controversial remarks about the besieged country as the war progressed. The billionaire reposted a modified excerpt from Zelensky&apos;s interview with the Suspilne broadcaster shared on X, which read: &quot;The U.S. cannot force us to &apos;sit and listen&apos; at the negotiating table. We are an independent country.&quot; Musk added his own comments, mockingly saying, &quot;(His) sense of humor is amazing.&quot; He also attached a link to a BBC article published in 2021, presenting Zelensky as a &quot;comedian who had no experience of politics when elected.&quot; The article was updated after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion, saying that the president &quot;has suddenly emerged as a convincing war leader.&quot; He sense of humor is amazing &#x1F602;https://t.co/4BL4rTXaZS https://t.co/pacq5vNkza In the interview with Suspilne, Zelensky was asked what messages he received from Trump regarding possible negotiations with Russia. The U.S. president-elect previously said he would end the war within &quot;24 hours,&quot; and his team pledged to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. &quot;We are independent Ukraine. I think that during this war, our people and I personally, in negotiations with the U.S., with Trump, Biden, and European leaders, have shown that the rhetoric &apos;sit and listen&apos; does not work with us,&quot; Zelensky responded. Musk made the post shortly after two U.S. Democratic senators called upon the government to investigate reports of Musk&apos;s communications with Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin. The Wall Street Journal&#x2019;s recent report cited U.S., European, and Russian officials who claimed Musk had several conversations with Putin and Russian Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Kiriyenko. Musk responded on his X network that he is &quot;going to find out who&apos;s making these accusations and nuke them.&quot; The billionaire is seen as becoming increasingly influential in Trump&apos;s team and has been tapped to lead the &quot;Department of Government Efficiency,&quot; a newly-proposed advisory body. According to Axios, Musk joined on a phone call between Zelensky and Trump shortly after the latter&apos;s election victory, reportedly saying he would continue to support Ukraine through his Starlink satellites.	https://kyivindependent.com/musk-mocks-zelensky/	2024-11-17T06:03:40-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/10/2023-10-06-15.30.20.jpg
Russia shows it has no intention of ceasing its aggression' — Kyiv's partners condemn Russian mass attack	Ukraine&apos;s international partners have denounced Russia&apos;s most recent mass aerial strike launched against the country on Nov. 17. &quot;As we approach 1000 days since the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia shows it has no intention of ceasing its aggression,&quot; said Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp. Russia launched 120 missiles and 90 drones against Ukraine, hitting energy infrastructure and residential areas across the country in what became one of the largest attacks during the war. &quot;The Netherlands will continue to support Ukraine in every way: politically, militarily, financially, and morally,&quot; Veldkamp said on X. &quot;Norway condemns this illegal war and continues to #StandWithUkraine, providing arms and support against Russia&#x2019;s aggression,&quot; Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in the wake of the attack. According to U.S. Ambassador to Kyiv Bridget A. Brink, the attack underscores how &quot;Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of all of Europe.&quot; Moldova&apos;s recently re-elected president, Maia Sandu, joined the condemnations, saying, &quot;Weaponizing winter to freeze a nation into submission is cruel and unacceptable. Moldova stands with Ukraine.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s neighbor Moldova has felt the effect of Russian attacks more directly, with missile and drone wreckage being discovered on Moldovan territory on several occasions. Russia&apos;s latest barrage of missile strikes marks the first mass missile attack on Kyiv in over 2 months, with Russia instead utilizing more frequent drone strikes in recent months to attack the capital. Moscow targeted &quot;power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;The transmission system operator has urgently introduced emergency shutdowns,&quot; Halushchenko said. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023.	https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-partners-condemn-russian-attack/	2024-11-17T04:26:31-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Rivne-Oblast.jpg
Russian defense plant over 1,300 km from Ukraine reportedly hit by drone strike	A drone strike damaged a factory on Nov. 17 in the Russian city of Izhevsk, more than 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the Ukrainian border, according to Alexander Brechalov, head of Russia&apos;s Udmurt Republic. The factory produces air defense systems, radars, and other equipment for the Russian military, said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation department at Ukraine&apos;s National Security and Defense Council. &quot;Uknown drones attacked the Izhevsk Electromechanical Plant Kupol in Russia. There, Russia produces the Tor air defense systems, as well as radars and other components,&quot; Kovalenko wrote on his Telegram channel. Brechalov reported an explosion and a &quot;drone crash&quot; at an unnamed &quot;factory workshop&quot; on the city&apos;s Lenina Street. One person was injured, and the crash damaged the facility&apos;s windows, the official claimed, adding that there &quot;was no serious damage.&quot; Citing local residents, the Russian Telegram channel Astra also reported that the 300th production unit of the Kupol defense plant, standing at the intersection of Lenina and 40 Let Pobedy streets, was targeted. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. Izhevsk is the regional center of the Udmurt Republic, lying in central Russia west of the Ural Mountains. This would mark the first drone attack against the region during the entire war. Throughout the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has carried out a number of long-range strikes deep inside Russian territory, primarily targeting the country&apos;s oil and defense industries.	https://kyivindependent.com/russian-plant-producing-air-defenses-allegedly-hit-by-drones/	2024-11-17T03:48:56-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-177207745.jpg
Ukraine's air defense downs 102 missiles, 42 drones during mass Russian strike	Ukrainian air defenses shot down 102 of the 120 missiles and 42 of the 90 drones launched by Russia overnight on Nov. 17, the Air Force reported. Russian forces launched one of the heaviest aerial strikes against the country throughout the full-scale war, primarily targeting the energy grid. During the attack, Russia deployed seven Tu-160, 16 Tu-95MS, and two Tu-22M3 bomber planes, five Su-34 fighter-bombers, four Su-27 fighter jets, 10 MiG-31K Kinzhal missile carriers, and four naval missile carriers, according to the Air Force. Russia attacked Ukraine with a hypersonic 3M22 Zirkon missile, seven air-launched Kinzhal missiles, 85 Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles, one Iskander-M ballistic missile, four anti-radar Kh-22/31P missiles, five Kh-59/69 aerial guided missiles, and 90 drones. The country&apos;s air defenses shot down the Zirkon missile, all of the Kinzhal, Kalibr, Kh-101, anti-radar, and Kh-59/69 missiles, and 42 drones. Forty-one drones were lost across Ukraine thanks to &quot;active countermeasures,&quot; while two flew back to Russia and occupied territories, according to the statement. Air defenses were active nearly all of Ukraine&apos;s regions: the Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Rivne, Volyn and Lviv oblasts. &quot;We are grateful to our air defense forces involved in the attack, our aviation &#x2013; F-16, Sukhoi, and MiG pilots &#x2013; mobile fire groups, electronic warfare units, everybody worked in an organized manner,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said. At least seven civilians were killed and at least 19 injured across multiple regions, according to preliminary data.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-downs-102-missiles-42-drones/	2024-11-17T03:02:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Frankiv.jpg
We need peace through strength, not appeasement' — Ukraine's FM reacts to Russian mass attack	Russia&apos;s latest mass attack on Ukraine shows Russian President Vladimir Putin&apos;s true response to attempts at appeasement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Nov. 17. &quot;Russia launched one of the largest air attacks: drones and missiles against peaceful cities, sleeping civilians, critical infrastructure,&quot; Sybiha said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down around 140 of the 210 drones and missiles launched at the country, primarily targeting the energy grid. &quot;This is war criminal Putin&#x2019;s true response to all those who called and visited him recently. We need peace through strength, not appeasement.&quot; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Nov. 15 held the first phone call with Putin in two years, during which he condemned Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry expressed concerns over the Scholz-Putin call, saying that such lengthy conversations have been a tool Putin has exploited for over 20 years, now providing him hope for easing his international isolation. The call came amid growing uncertainties about the stability of Western support and Ukraine&apos;s setbacks on the battlefield. Donald Trump&apos;s victory in the U.S. election adds to the uncertainties, with some fearing that Washington might withdraw its support and force Kyiv toward painful concessions. In turn, top Ukrainian officials voiced hope for a more resolute decision-making. &quot;Certainly, with the policies of this team that will now lead the White House, the war will end faster. This is their approach, their promise to their society, and it is also very important to them,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky said.	https://kyivindependent.com/fm-reacts-to-russian-mass-attack/	2024-11-17T02:27:49-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/Odesa-12.jpg
Biden meets Xi, condemns North Korean troops dispatch to Russia	Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Lima on Nov. 16 &#xA0;to discuss a &quot;range of bilateral, regional, and global issues,&quot; the White House said. Biden met the Chinese leader on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, marking his last meeting with Xi before leaving office in January 2025. &quot;President Biden condemned the deployment of thousands of (North Korean) troops to Russia, a dangerous expansion of Russia&#x2019;s unlawful war against Ukraine with serious consequences for both European and Indo-Pacific peace and security,&quot; the White House statement read. Pyongyang has deployed around 11,000 troops to reinforce Moscow&apos;s troops in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, in addition to already provided artillery and missiles. China, a close partner to both Russia and North Korea, has claimed it had no knowledge of the troop transfer, though some experts disputed this statement. Biden also &quot;expressed deep concern over (China&apos;s) continued support for Russia&#x2019;s defense industrial base.&quot; While claiming neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war, China has become Russia&apos;s leading source of dual-use goods, helping to sustain the Russian defense industry amid the invasion. The German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) recently reported that the EU obtained evidence that this support has expanded to &quot;lethal aid,&quot; specifically the production of attack drones. During the meeting, Xi claimed that China&apos;s position regarding the war has &quot;always been fair and square,&quot; the Xinhua state news agency reported. The Chinese president also said his country would &quot;not allow conflict and turmoil to happen on the Korean Peninsula&quot; and that Beijing would &quot;not sit idly by&quot; while its strategic interests are endangered, Xinhua wrote. Biden is concluding his term before the inauguration of his political rival and former president, Donald Trump, whose return to the White House may significantly impact Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine and security worldwide.	https://kyivindependent.com/biden-meets-xi/	2024-11-17T01:46:15-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2184468400.jpg
Russia attacks thermal power plants, dealing 'serious damage,' operator says	Russia targeted thermal power plants during a mass strike on the country&apos;s power grid on Nov. 17, dealing &quot;serious damage,&quot; said the country&apos;s largest private energy company, DTEK. Russia targeted energy facilities throughout Ukraine in what was one of the heaviest strikes on the country&apos;s power grid during the entire full-scale war, with Russia launching around 120 missiles and 90 drones. &quot;DTEK thermal power plants came under attack. According to preliminary data, there were no casualties,&quot; the company said in a statement. The location of the energy stations was not specified, presumably due to security reasons. Energy equipment was heavily damaged, but DTEK employees began repair work after the end of the attack. The company says this marks the eighth mass attack on its energy plants this year. &quot;In total, since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, DTEK thermal power plants have been fired upon more than 190 times,&quot; the energy operator said. Russia targeted &quot;power generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine,&quot; according to Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko. &quot;The transmission system operator has urgently introduced emergency shutdowns,&quot; Halushchenko said. Energy infrastructure facilities were reported as damaged in the Volyn and Vinnytsia oblasts. Officials have been warning that Russia may resume strikes on the energy grid as temperatures drop, mirroring the strategy used in the spring and summer of this year and in the autumn-winter season of 2022-2023. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in September that past Russian attacks had destroyed all of Ukraine&apos;s thermal power plants and almost all hydroelectric capacity. Ukrainian authorities and energy companies have been repairing and reinforcing energy facilities in the expectation of renewed attacks. According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, Ukraine&apos;s electricity shortage could reach 6 gigawatts this winter as a result of the attacks, which is about one-third of the expected peak demand. This summer, the power shortage was 2.5 GW when Kyiv was already experiencing long blackouts.	https://kyivindependent.com/thermal-power-plant-seriously-damaged-in-russian-attack-operator-says/	2024-11-17T00:46:12-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1247620233.jpg

Russia launches large-scale missile attack on Ukraine, explosions heard in multiple cities	Editor&apos;s note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Russia launched a large-scale missile attack on Ukraine overnight on Nov. 17. No information was immediately available as to any damage or casualties reported, although multiple ballistic missiles were reportedly launched from the Black Sea, as well as Russia&apos;s Astrakhan Oblast and Krasnodar Krai, toward Kyiv. Explosions were reported in the capital Kyiv around 6:30 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Further explosions were also heard in the city of Kropyvnytskyi. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force issued the air raid alters across the country around 6 a.m. local time, warning of the attack. Ukraine&apos;s Air Force reported earlier in the night that Tu-95 strategic bombers took off from the Russian airfields of Olenya in Murmansk Oblast. Later in the night, the War Monitor Telegram channel reported that a total of 17 Tu-95 strategic bombers were in flight, with seven taking off at the Engels airbase in Saratov Oblast. In recent months, Russia has primarily focused on large-scale drone attacks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses in cities across the country. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. While missile attacks are a common occurrence in Ukraine eastern oblasts, most Ukrainian regions have largely been spared from large-scale Russian missile attacks on infrastructure in recent months.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-launches-large-scale-missile-attack-on-ukraine/	2024-11-16T20:27:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/2022-04-2560px-neptune-cruise-missile-05-1024x689.jpg
Ukrainian partisans say they sabotaged railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast	The Atesh partisan group sabotaged a key railway in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast, disabling electrical equipment and causing disruptions to Russia&apos;s military supply chain, the group claimed on Nov. 16. An Atesh operative burned a relay cabinet near the Russian-occupied city of Tokmak, the partisans said, publishing purported footage of the sabotage without specifying the date. The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims. According to the group, the sabotage occurred between two rail stations in occupied Tokmak. 0:00/1&#xD7;Purported footage of a sabotage of a railway cabinet relay near the occupied city of Tokmak. Video published on Nov. 16 2024. (Atesh/Telegram)&quot;Russian forces are intensifying their offensive in the Zaporizhzhia direction. This makes sabotage operations a serious problem for them, complicating logistics and disrupting the regular supply of ammunition and fuel,&quot; the group said on Telegram. &quot;These interruptions gradually undermine the combat effectiveness of Russian troops, slow their offensive actions, and increase losses, ultimately reducing their chances of achieving their objectives,&quot; the group added. In early October, Russian troops reportedly renewed their attack in the Zaporizhzhia sector. Kyiv warned of a potential Russian push in the southern region, just as Moscow&apos;s troops continue advancing in Ukraine&apos;s east. Amid increased attacks in the region, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military&apos;s Southern Command, told the news outlet Suspilne on Nov. 12 that the Russian army is deploying trained assault groups to frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks in both occupied areas of Ukraine and inside Russia itself. On at least two different occasions, the saboteurs have previously claimed to attack rail lines insides Russia, targeting North Korean ammunition transporting throughout the country.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-partisans-say-they-sabotaged-railway-in-occupied-zaporizhzhia/	2024-11-16T19:56:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/photo_2024-11-16_04-14-50.jpg
Estonia approves delivery of additional military aid package for Ukraine	Estonia&apos;s cabinet approved a proposal to deliver another package of military aid for Ukraine on Nov. 16, the country&apos;s Defense Ministry announced. The latest aid package will include an unspecified amount of munitions and military equipment, including naval uniforms, observation equipment, sights, and protective equipment. It was not immediately clear as to when the package is expected to arrive in Ukraine. The approval comes just days after Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur visited Kyiv on Nov. 11, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and broadly announced a new aid package for Ukraine consisting of &quot;clothing&quot; and &quot;small arms.&quot; &quot;Ukraine continues to need help from Estonia and the free world to protect itself. This time, the aid package has been put together from the reserves of our defense forces, taking into account the needs of Ukraine, and still in such a way that Estonia&apos;s defense capability does not suffer,&quot; Pevkur said in a statement. &quot;This aid package will not be the last, and in the near future we will open a competition-based annual support measure for Estonian companies, which will enable Ukraine to assist with the production of the Estonian defense industry,&quot; Pevkur added. Ukraine&apos;s Defense Ministry announced on Nov. 8 that Estonian arms company Frankenburg Technologies will transfer air defense missiles to Ukraine for testing. Estonia has been among Kyiv&apos;s staunchest supporters since the start of the full-scale invasion began, offering humanitarian, developmental, and military assistance. Estonia and Ukraine signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement on June 26. The deal stipulates that Estonia will supply Ukraine with defense aid worth more than 100 million euros ($107 million). Estonia has provided over 500 million euros ($527 million) in military aid to Ukraine since February 2022, amounting to 1.4% of the country&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP), ranking among the top military supporters of Ukraine as a percentage of the country&apos;s GDP.	https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-approves-delivery-of-additional-military-aid-package-for-ukraine/	2024-11-16T18:27:29-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/11/estonia.jpg
Iran denies claims its UN envoy met with Elon Musk	Iran&apos;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Nov. 16 dismissed reports about a meeting between Tehran&apos;s United Nations envoy and U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who is also a close adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. U.S. media outlets, including The New York Times, reported that Musk and Iran&apos;s UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani had an hour-long conversation in New York on Monday. The Iranians, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss policy publicly, described the meeting as &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;good news,&quot; the New York Times reported on Nov. 14. &quot;This was a fabricated story by American media, and the motives behind this can also be speculated,&quot; Araqchi said during an interview with state television, reiterating an earlier denial from Iran&apos;s Foreign Ministry. The Iranian minister described the report of a meeting as a &quot;media fabrication&quot; intended to test the waters and gauge the potential for such an occurrence. &quot;We are still waiting for the new US administration to clarify its policies, and based on that, we will adjust our own policies. Right now, it is neither the time for such meetings nor is it appropriate,&quot; Araqchi added. He also emphasized that the leadership had not authorized such a meeting, referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.	https://kyivindependent.com/iran-denies-claims-its-un-envoy-met-with-elon-musk/	2024-11-16T15:57:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1678296636.jpg
North Korean delivers 70 missile launchers, artillery systems to Russia's Kursk Oblast, FT reports	North Korea has provided Russia with 50 domestically produced self-propelled howitzers and 20 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), the Financial Times (FT) reported on Nov. 16, citing a Ukrainian intelligence assessment. The additional support by Pyongyang come as 11,000 North Korean troops are amassing in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast, training alongside Russian troops in its fight against Ukraine. A Pentagon spokesperson said on Nov. 13 that some North Korean troops have already been deployed to fight along Russian forces. According to FT, some of the delivered weapons have been moved to Kursk Oblast to assist in Russia&apos;s effort to regain control of the territory it lost to Ukrainian forces earlier this year. The weapons include North Korean-made 170mm M1989 self-propelled howitzers as well as updated 240mm MLRS systems. The reliability of North Korean-made weapons has previously come into question, with reports by South Korea&apos;s intelligence agency that Pyongyang previously sent weapons made in the 1970s to Moscow. With Russia&apos;s military stocks running low and domestic production capacity simultaneously hampered by Western sanctions, North Korea has been shaping up as Russia&apos;s leading weapons supplier, providing Moscow with extensive military packages North Korea has previously provided Russia with as many as 4.8 million artillery shells, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said in June. Both Kyiv and Washington have previously said that Russia has been using North Korean-produced missiles to attack Ukraine. In March of this year, Ukrainian prosecutors reported that Russia had fired around 50 such missiles to attack six Ukrainian oblasts since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Increased military support by Pyongyang started rolling into Russia after the signing of an agreement in June during Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s visit to the North Korean capital. The agreement pledged to provide each other aid if either country is attacked, in addition to other military and humanitarian support. On Nov. 12, North Korea formalized the mutual defense treaty with Russia, while Russian lawmakers unanimously approved the treaty last week, and President Vladimir Putin signed it into law the week prior. As alliances between Russia and North Korea continue to deepen, South Korean relations with Ukraine also continue to grow. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a press conference on Nov. 7. that the country does not rule out providing arms to Ukraine. South Korea has previously provided Ukraine with humanitarian and non-lethal aid but refused to provide weapons, citing legislative restrictions.	https://kyivindependent.com/north-korean-delivers-70-missile-launchers-artillery-systems-to-russias-kursk-oblast/	2024-11-16T12:32:58-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2157652819.jpg
Russia producing thermobaric drones, capable of causing 'simply terrifying' damage to civilians, AP reports	Russia recently began producing thermobaric drones to be used alongside decoy drones in Ukraine, which are capable of causing severe damage to civilians, an investigation by the Associated Press (AP) revealed on Nov. 16. While thermobaric warheads have reportedly been previously used by Russia in Ukraine on missiles, their use on attack drones would mark an escalation of the warhead&apos;s use. Thermobaric warheads create a wave of high pressure and heat that is capable of penetrating thick walls, AP reported. The damage caused by thermobaric attack drones would cause damage that would be &quot;simply terrifying&quot; for civilian populations to endure, including collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, and brain damage, according to a source familiar with Russian drone production. While controversial, thermobaric munitions are not prohibited under international law. According to the AP investigation, the thermobaric weapons would be deployed alongside decoy drones meant to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Decoy drones have been regularly used in recent months as Russia has increased its drone attack on Ukrainian cities since the beginning of September. The Ukrainian Air Force previously said that Russia launched at least 4,300 Shahed-type attack drones and similar UAVs imitating Shaheds against Ukraine between August and October 2024. The Russian production of thermobaric drones, codenamed Operation False Target, is currently in production in Russia&#x2019;s Alabuga Special Economic Zone in the country&apos;s Tatarstan Republic. Russia continues to use drones to overwhelm Ukrainian cities ahead of expected attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities ahead of the winter months. The use of thermobaric drones would likely be used primarily to penetrate thick walls and underground energy substation, ideal for targeting energy facilities. In recent months, Iran and China have continue to supply components for Russian attack drones. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war in Ukraine. While Iran has continuously produced Shahed-type drones for Russia&apos;s use in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers on Nov. 18, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported, citing three EU officials. China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-producing-thermobaric-drones-capable-of-causing-simply-terrifying-damage-to-civilians-ap-reports/	2024-11-16T10:06:48-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1242279354.jpg
Zelensky, Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaya discuss North Korean troop presence, support for Ukraine, during surprise visit to Kyiv	Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Nov. 16 during an unannounced visit to the capital, marking his first trip to Ukraine since being appointed to the post in September. According to a statement from the President&apos;s Office, Zelensky and Iwaya discussed a number of topics in support of Ukraine, including Japan&apos;s concern regarding the presence of North Korean troops along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front. &quot;In light of what is happening with the intervention of the North Korean military in Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, it is important to discuss how to prevent further escalation by Russia, already together with North Korea,&quot; Zelensky said in a statement. &#xA0; Training alongside Russian forces in Kursk Oblast, the first North Korean soldiers stationed in the region reportedly came under fire on Nov. 4. During the meeting, Iwaya noted that &quot;Japan stands with Ukraine,&quot; echoing a statement released by Group of Seven (G7) reaffirming their &quot;unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes&quot; and commitment to &quot;severe costs&quot; for Russia on Nov. 16. Iwaya further emphasized that Japan is committed to further strengthening relations with Ukraine, including the expansion of economic cooperation, as well as applying additional sanctions against Russia. Zelensky and Iwaya also discussed Ukraine&apos;s &quot;Peace Formula&quot; as well as Zelensky&apos;s five-point victory plan. &quot;Japan supports the early realization of a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, as set out in the victory plan,&quot; Iwaya said, according to a readout released by Japan&apos;s foreign ministry. Earlier in the day, Iwaya met with his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha following a visit to Bucha &#x2014; a suburb northwest of Kyiv, occupied by Russian troops shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine which saw some of Russia&apos;s worst atrocities against civilians during the war. No information was provided by either country as to any specific agreements reached at the meetings. The meeting marks the first trip to Kyiv by a Japanese minister since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last month. During the meeting with Iwaya, Zelensky invited Ishiba to a visit of the country. Japan has played a key role in providing support to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion, delivering nearly $12 billion in support for the embattled country. Ukraine&apos;s finance ministry said on Nov. 15 that Japan has provided a total of $6.3 billion in external budget financing for the embattled nation.	https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-japanese-foreign-minister-iwaya-discuss-north-korean-troop-presence-support-for-ukraine-during-surprise-visit-to-kyiv/	2024-11-16T09:06:09-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/01a42da329c0131b0e76cef1e4724858_1731762990_extra_large.jpeg
Trump wouldn’t want ‘major Russian victory,’ says ex-US ambassador	The Kyiv Independent sat down with the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst, to discuss the future of the U.S. policy towards Ukraine as it continues its defense against Russia&#x2019;s aggression.	https://kyivindependent.com/trump-wouldnt-want-major-russian-victory-says-ex-us-ambassador/	2024-11-16T07:51:18-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/IMG_7262.JPG
Ukraine destroys flag planted by Russian troops at border in Chernihiv Oblast	A day after videos showed Russian troops planting a Russian flag in a grey zone near the border in Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine&apos;s State Border Guard Service released a video showing a drone destroying the flag on Nov. 16. &quot;Intelligence indicated that the Russian sabotage and reconnaissance group left the area even before the elimination of the established flags, not daring to take further action,&quot; the service wrote in a statement accompanying the video. &quot;This is another unsuccessful attempt by the enemy to impose its &apos;victories,&apos; and nothing more than a psychological trick that has no military meaning,&quot; the statement continued. Russian military bloggers a day earlier posted videos appearing to show Russian troops planting a flag on the bridge over the Sudost River near the border settlement of Hremiach and claimed they entered Hremiach and Muravi. A spokesperson for the Border Service denied that Russian forces entered the settlements and said that they did not cross the bridge. The spokesperson, Andrii Demchenko, added that no major defensive was detected and Ukraine has deployed additional forces in the area to fend off acts of sabotage from Russia. Chernihiv Oblast is located on Ukraine&#x2019;s northern border with Russia and Belarus. It was partially occupied during Russia&apos;s initial offensive in February 2022, but the invading force retreated in April after the Kremlin failed to take Kyiv.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-destroys-flag-planted-by-russian-troops-at-border-in-chernihiv/	2024-11-16T07:39:27-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/--------------2024-11-15---13_55_00.png
Ukraine, US to partner on developing small modular nuclear reactors for reconstruction	The United States will partner with Ukraine to transition Ukraine&apos;s coal-fired plants to small modular nuclear reactors, and to use them to help decarbonize its steel industry, the countries announced on Nov. 16 at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. Small modular reactors (SMR) are an emerging technology that allow for reactors to be transported and assembled on site. The partnership will build a roadmap and provide technical support to &quot;rebuild, modernize, and decarbonize Ukraine&apos;s steel industry with SMRs,&quot; according to a statement from the U.S. State Department. It will also &quot;facilitate the transition of Ukraine&#x2019;s coal-fired power plants to secure and safe SMR nuclear power plants utilizing existing infrastructure and retraining the workforce,&quot; the statement read. Another project announced at the conference, known as COP29, will build a pilot plant in Ukraine to demonstrate production of clean hydrogen and ammonia using simulated SMR technology. &#xA0; Ukraine is expected to face a brutal energy crisis through its toughest winter since the start of the full-scale invasion after Russia took out capacity from half of its electricity generation sector in large-scale air strikes. The infographic showcases the countries with the top percentage share of nuclear energy production. (Lisa Kukharska / The Kyiv Independent)As Ukraine hurries to rebuild its devastated energy structure, many foreign partners are looking for ways to encourage greener and more sustainable energy solutions. Wind and solar projects are in high demand, although many of Ukraine&apos;s infrastructure projects are emergency solutions rather than part of a broader green strategy. Following the occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in 2022, the three nuclear plants remaining under government control provide around 60% of its power. However, Russia is eyeing attacks on Ukraine&#x2019;s nuclear infrastructure, the Energy Ministry&apos;s press office told the Kyiv Independent last month. The energy-intensive steel industry produced a tenth of Ukraine&apos;s pre-war GDP, but last year&apos;s production was less than a third of Ukraine&apos;s total 2021 steel production. Energy blackouts are a major factor in the drop in production, alongside worker shortages, high electricity prices, and disrupted supply chains as a result of the full-scale invasion.	https://kyivindependent.com/new-us-ukraine-energy-partnership-will-develop-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-for-ukraines-steel-industry/	2024-11-16T06:48:03-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-1243382977.jpg
G7 leaders reaffirm commitment to 'severe costs' for Russia and 'unwavering support' for Ukraine	Leaders of the Group of Seven released a statement reaffirming their &quot;unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes&quot; and commitment to &quot;severe costs&quot; for Russia on Nov. 16. &quot;Russia remains the sole obstacle to just and lasting peace,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The G7 confirms its commitment to imposing severe costs on Russia through sanctions, export controls and other effective measures.&quot; Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose country is currently serving in the rotating presidency of the group, initiated the statement as the 1,000th day of the war approaches. In October, the G7 announced it reached an agreement to provide Ukraine with approximately $50 billion in loans backed by the revenue from foreign Russian assets. The funds will support Ukraine&apos;s economic, defense, and reconstruction needs.	https://kyivindependent.com/g7-leaders-reaffirm-commitment-to-severe-costs-for-russia-and-unwavering-support-for-ukraine/	2024-11-16T06:19:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Russia cutting off gas sent to Austria via Ukraine, Austrian gas supplier says	Russia&apos;s Gazprom Export announced that its supply of natural gas to Austria is ending on Nov. 16, according to OMV, Austria&apos;s largest gas supply company. The Austrian energy company said it had expected this to occur and will continue to import gas from Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, according to a report from Deutsche Welle. Russia has been paying Ukraine transport fees to carry its gas to Europe through Ukrainian pipelines as part of a 2019 agreement. Russia has been raking in billions of dollars of profits selling the gas to European partners, including Austria. The transit deal between Ukraine and Russia is set to expire at the end of the year. Ukraine has repeatedly stated it will not renew the agreement. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war, European countries have taken steps to sharply reduce their dependence on Russian gas, with the share of Russian gas among EU natural gas imports dropped from 45% in 2021 to 15% last year. Austria, however, has been importing the highest share of Russian natural gas of any EU country, hitting a record of 98% in December 2023 and fluctuating above 80% in recent months. The country has pledged to eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said &quot;the supply is secure&quot; and &quot;no one will freeze,&quot; according to Deutsche Welle. &quot;Our gas storage facilities are full and we have sufficient capacity to obtain gas from other regions,&quot; he added. Earlier in the week, the International Chamber of Commerce awarded OMV a $243 million award from Gazprom due to irregularities in German gas supplies the company was providing. At the time, the company said it saw the potential for a halt in the gas supply as a result.	https://kyivindependent.com/russia-is-cutting-off-gas-sent-to-austria-via-ukraine-austrian-gas-supplier-says/	2024-11-16T05:14:50-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/05/GettyImages-1230851711.jpeg
Ukraine destroys $10 million Russian Buk air-defense system, Interior Ministry says	A drone unit in the National Guard&apos;s 27th Pechersk Brigade destroyed a Russian anti-aircraft missile BUK-M1 system worth $10 million, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on Nov 16. A Telegram video shared by Klymenko, whose ministry oversees the National Guard, showed the system being targeted at &quot;one of the hottest areas of the front,&quot; without specifying which exact area. On the morning of Nov. 16, the General Staff reported that Russia had lost 999 air defense systems since the start of its full-scale invasion, which would make this loss Russia&apos;s 1000th. The Soviet-era BUK-M1 surface-to-air missile systems have been used by both Ukrainians and Russians in this war. Last year, Ukraine announced it had converted the systems to shoot American missiles. Ukraine inherited Buk-M1 anti-aircraft systems from the Soviet Union, but the weapons typically use missiles that only Russia produces.	https://kyivindependent.com/interior-ministry-ukraine-destroys-a-10-million-russian-buk-air-defense-system/	2024-11-16T03:36:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-1240557988.jpg
We must do everything to end this war next year through diplomatic means': Zelensky speaks on negotiations, war	Ukraine must do everything possible to end the war through diplomatic means, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a wide-ranging interview with Suspilne broadcast on Nov. 16. During the interview, he told the broadcaster that he does not believe Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace but will instead use negotiations to reintegrate himself among Western countries that have isolated him since the start of the full-scale invasion. &quot;I don&apos;t think Putin wants peace at all. But this does not mean that he does not want to sit down with one of the leaders&quot; to negotiate, Zelensky said. &#xA0; &quot;For him it destroys the political isolation that has been built since the beginning of the war. And it benefits him to sit down, talk, and not reach an agreement.&quot; The previous day, Zelensky had warned that a phone call that day between Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz &#x2013; their first in nearly two years &#x2013; risked opening a &quot;Pandora&apos;s Box.&quot; In the interview with Suspilne, Zelensky said that as president, he would only be able to negotiate seriously with the President of the United States, which Donald Trump does not become until he is inaugurated in January. A necessary condition for negotiations, he added, is that Ukraine would not be &quot;alone&quot; with Russia, as just speaking with Putin was a &quot;losing position.&quot; He also said that the United States could not take a neutral position as a mediator: &quot;America must maintain the position that Russia is an aggressor, that it has violated our territorial integrity and international law.&quot; Regardless, the war in Ukraine will &quot;end faster&quot; under a Trump administration, Zelensky believes. Zelensky also said that the country was &quot;grateful&quot; for the aid received, but still has not received half of the weapons allocated by the U.S. Among its own domestically-produced weapons, the country is currently testing four types of missiles, he said. When asked about the challenging situation on the frontlines, Zelensky acknowledged &quot;slow, but nevertheless advancements&quot; by the Russians. He cited fatigue among fighters, the slow pace of filling and equipping brigades, as well as delays on weapons deliveries from abroad. Regarding mobilization, Zelensky said that in general, some things need to be adjusted but some things are going as planned, though there still is a need for more mobilization as the current figures are not enough. Zelensky also said that the country expects combined strikes throughout the winter, but considers Ukraine is &quot;a very good position&quot; regarding its air defense systems.	https://kyivindependent.com/we-must-do-everything-to-end-this-war-next-year-through-diplomatic-means-zelensky-speaks-on-negotiations-war/	2024-11-16T03:01:54-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2169775129.jpg
Germany, China expected to discuss war in Ukraine, North Korean troops next week	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected discuss the war in Ukraine and the involvement of North Korean troops during the upcoming G20 Summit in Brazil next week, German media reported on Nov. 15. Germany also announced on Nov. 15 that Scholz had held his first call in nearly two years with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which he condemned the war and urged Putin to withdraw his troops. The Pentagon confirmed on Nov. 13 that North Korean soldiers had begun engaging in combat alongside Russian troops in Kursk Oblast. The announcement followed reports that Russia is mustering a force of 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, to launch a counteroffensive against Ukraine in the Kursk region. The discussions come at a difficult time for Ukraine, as Russia holds the upper hand on the battlefield, and Donald Trump&apos;s imminent return to the White House may lead to a decreased U.S. involvement in the war. Kyiv&apos;s European partners are increasingly preparing for a deal that could include Ukraine giving up on some of its territories in return for security guarantees, the Washington Post reported on Nov. 13, citing interviews with 10 current and former Western officials. The Chinese and German leaders last met in April when Scholz visited China. &#xA0; U.S. President Joe Biden is also expected to discuss with Xi China&apos;s support for Russia, as well as North Korean troops deployed in the war, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Peru of the Nov. 16.	https://kyivindependent.com/germany-china-expected-to-discuss-war-in-ukraine-and-north-korean-troops-next-week/	2024-11-16T00:26:34-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/04/GettyImages-2147847310.jpg

EU preparing additional sanctions against Iran over missile shipments to Russia	The European Union is preparing to implement additional sanctions against Iranian individuals and entities involved in propping up Russia&apos;s war machine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Nov. 15, citing a top EU official. &quot;There will be sanctions: we have a political agreement on the second package against Iran regarding the transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia,&quot; the unnamed source told RFE/RL. The EU and other Western powers have previously slapped sanctions on Iran after it was revealed that Tehran supplied Fath-360 close-range ballistic missiles to Moscow. On Oct. 14, the EU adopted sanctions against seven individuals and seven entities over Iran&apos;s missile and drone shipments to Russia. The latest sanctions package will target one Iranian individual as well as four entities involved in the delivery of Iranian military goods to Russia. Three of the companies are Russian shipping companies involved with the delivery of Iranian weaponry, RFE/RF reported. &quot;We want to continue the pressure on Iran, sending a clear message to Tehran that it should stop military cooperation with Russia,&quot; the EU official said. Moscow and Tehran have deepened military and political ties since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Iran supplying Russia with Shahed attack drones and missiles. In addition to formalizing the Iranian sanctions package, EU foreign ministers will discuss during their meeting in Brussels on Nov. 18, readying the European bloc&apos;s 15th package of sanctions against Russia, targeting foreign-made components found in Russian weaponry.	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-iran-sanctions/	2024-11-15T21:06:43-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2002625944.jpg
Japanese foreign minister arrives in Kyiv	Japan&apos;s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya arrived in Kyiv for an unannounced visit overnight on Nov. 16 in a show of Tokyo&apos;s support for the besieged country. Iwaya will meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha in the daytime ahead of a possible meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Japan&apos;s foreign ministry told Kyodo news. The meeting marks the first trip by a Japanese minister since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last month, and the first to Ukraine by Iwaya who was first appointed to the post in September. The visit to Kyiv likely comes in response to the presence of North Korean troops situated along Ukraine&apos;s eastern front, as well as future uncertainty surrounding ongoing military support from the United States following the election of President-elect Donald Trump. The visit also comes ahead of the start of an expectedly grueling winter that will test Ukrainians&apos; resolve as Russian continues to target energy infrastructure across the country. In a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in the U.S. on Sept. 23, Zelensky discussed Japan&apos;s ongoing support for Ukraine, with particular focus on Ukraine&apos;s energy sector. Last month, Japan alongside the U.S. and South Korea also launched a new multinational group to monitor the implementation of sanctions against North Korea, Reuters reported on Oct. 16. Japan has played a key role in providing support to Ukraine since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. Ukraine&apos;s finance ministry said on Nov. 15 that Japan has provided a total of $6.3 billion in external budget financing for the embattled nation.	https://kyivindependent.com/japanese-foreign-minister-arrives-in-kyiv-2/	2024-11-15T20:00:42-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/gettyimages-2183531318-612x612.jpg
EU has 'convincing' evidence of reported Chinese attack drone production for Russia, media reports	The EU&apos;s top diplomat Josep Borrell reportedly informed European nations of &quot;convincing&quot; evidence of Chinese production &quot;of lethal aid&quot; to Russia, ahead of an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers, the German media outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported on Nov. 15, citing three EU officials. The lethal aid in question reportedly refers to a Chinese firm&apos;s role in attack drone production for Russia in its war against Ukraine. Reuters reported on Sept. 25 citing European intelligence sources that Russia has secretly established a development and production program in China for attack drones to be used in the war. &quot;We have had reports from intelligence sources on the existence of a factory inside China producing drones which are shipped to Russia,&quot; a senior EU official told Politico on Nov. 15. The official told Politico that the EU has yet to determine whether Beijing is aware of the firm&apos;s drone production. China&apos;s foreign ministry has previously denied knowledge of the project. In a separate comment to FAZ, a EU diplomat acknowledged that while there is not any direct evidence to implicate Beijing in the drone production, the official said it was difficult &quot;to imagine that something like this would happen and the Chinese government wouldn&apos;t know anything about it at all.&quot; China has positioned itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war but has simultaneously deepened economic ties with Moscow and backed the country against Western sanctions. Beijing has also emerged as one of Russia&apos;s leading sources of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry. In an interview with ABC News aired on Sept. 24., President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is using Chinese satellites to take pictures of Ukraine&apos;s nuclear facilities for possible future attacks. Although it is unclear what concrete steps the EU will take in response to the reported drone production, implementing additional sanction may be on the table for the European bloc &#x2014; including adding more Chinese companies to a list of firms facing EU sanctions, an EU diplomat told Politico. U.S. President Joe Biden is also expected to discuss China&apos;s support for Russia on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit summit in Peru on Nov. 16. According to the White House, Biden is expected to voice his &quot;deep concern&quot; regarding China&apos;s &quot;support for Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/eu-china/	2024-11-15T19:15:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2153185709.jpg
Ukraine's foreign budget support surpasses $100 billion since start of full-scale war	Since the start of Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has received over $100 billion in foreign-backed external financing to support Ukraine&apos;s state budget, the country&apos;s finance ministry announced on Nov. 15. In addition to military aid to support Ukrainian military efforts along its eastern border, Western countries and institutions have helped to finance Ukraine&apos;s state budget amid increased budgetary pressures on the embattled nation. Ukraine&apos;s external financing is primarily received through various cooperation programs including International Monetary Fund&apos;s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility program, the European Union&apos;s Ukraine Facility program, the World Bank, as well as directly from individual countries. European Union nations rank first in providing external budget support with a combined $40.5 billion, the finance ministry announced. EU member states are followed by the United States with $28.2 billion in support, the International Monetary Fund at $11.4 billion, Japan at $6.3 billion, and Canada with $5.4 billion in budget support &#x2014; all of which amounting to more than 90% of Ukraine&apos;s external financing. &quot;While the military campaign is financed by domestic resources, Ukraine counts on the support of international partners to finance social and humanitarian needs. No country can face challenges of this scale alone,&quot; Ukraine&apos;s finance ministry said a statement. Of the total external budget support, about 33% of the aid &#x2014; or $33.7 billion &#x2014; has come in the form of non-repayable grants, with the United States providing the plurality of the grant funding. Combining external funding with military assistance for Ukraine, the United States leads in its support allocating $175 billion to assist Ukraine &#x2014; although that number includes an number government funding projects associated with the war including domestic weapons production. In April 2024, the U.S. approved its largest foreign aid bill providing $61 billion for Ukraine. Ukraine expects to receive a total of $40.8 billion in external financing in 2024, having received $27.2 billion as of Nov. 14. The total for 2024 is in line with a record high in external financing provided in 2023 at $42.5 billion. Ukraine&apos;s Deputy Finance Minister Olha Zykova said in August that the country would need to increase its external budget support by $12-15 billion for it to meet its domestic needs. Earlier this year, Group of Seven (G7) nations finalized a framework agreement for a $50 billion loan for Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets revenue.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-foreign-budget-support-surpasses-100-billion-since-start-of-full-scale-war/	2024-11-15T17:57:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2156753132.jpg
Kazakh companies supply electronic warfare equipment to Russia despite sanctions, media reports	Several companies in Kazakhstan are playing a significant role in helping Russia circumvent Western sanctions by supplying equipment for the development of electronic warfare (EW) systems, according to The Insider, the Russian independent investigative outlet. The outlet reported on Nov. 15 that Kazakhastan-based firms, including Askarlab, Dicosta Technologies, Panalem Technologies, and Computer Services Ltd, have been sourcing equipment from Europe, Asia, and the United States, then delivering it to Russia. From 2023 to 2024, these companies acquired products from international manufacturers, including Germany&#x2019;s Rohde &amp; Schwarz, France&#x2019;s Safran Data Systems, the U.S.-based Mini-Circuits, and Ireland&#x2019;s Farran Technology. The sourced equipment consisted of advanced components such as radio frequency filters, frequency analyzers, RF adapters, amplifiers, attenuators, frequency extenders, satellite modems, and vector network analyzers. The Insider cited customs declarations from the Zhetysu customs post in Almaty, along with Russian records and communications involving Askarlab&#x2019;s director. Since 2023, these items have been transported by air, processed through customs, and, in numerous cases, sent to Russia. Askarlab alone reportedly procured high-end radio-technical equipment valued at approximately $2 million between November 2023 and early 2024. The Insider pointed out that Russia&apos;s reliance on alternative supply routes has prompted Western countries to impose secondary sanctions on organizations involved in facilitating such activities. These measures aim to curtail the flow of restricted technology and equipment to Russia amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions.	https://kyivindependent.com/kazakh-companies-supply-electronic-warfare-equipment-to-russia-despite-sanctions-media-reports/	2024-11-15T16:37:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2170787305.jpg
Democratic senators urge investigation into Musk's calls with Russia, Reuters reports	Two senior Democratic senators are calling for the Pentagon and law enforcement agencies to investigate reports of Elon Musk&#x2019;s communications with Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Jeanne Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Jack Reed, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed national security concerns in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Pentagon&apos;s inspector general. In the letter seen by Reuters on Nov. 15, the senators argued that Musk&#x2019;s involvement in SpaceX programs should be reviewed for potential debarment and exclusion due to these alleged contacts. Debarment would bar him from certain contracts and privileges. &quot;These relationships between a well-known U.S. adversary and Mr. Musk, a beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. government funding, pose serious questions regarding Mr. Musk&#x2019;s reliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder,&quot; the senators wrote. The letter followed reports of Musk&#x2019;s conversations with Russian officials as recently as October. The Wall Street Journal&#x2019;s recent report cited U.S., European, and Russian officials who claimed Musk had several conversations with Putin and Russian Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Kiriyenko. Shaheen and Reed found it &quot;deeply concerning&quot; that Musk reportedly spoke with Kiriyenko, who faced charges from the U.S. Justice Department this year for leading an AI-based propaganda campaign promoting Russian interests ahead of the U.S. presidential election. Musk&#x2019;s communications with Russian figures first drew attention in 2022 when Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, said Musk had spoken to Putin about the Ukraine war and the Kremlin&#x2019;s &quot;red line&quot; regarding nuclear weapon use. Musk denied Bremmer&#x2019;s claim, saying he had only discussed space-related topics with Putin 18 months prior. Musk oversees SpaceX, which holds billions of dollars in U.S. government contracts with the Pentagon and NASA, and has a $1.8-billion intelligence community contract to develop a spy satellite network. Musk has claimed he possesses a U.S. security clearance, allowing him access to classified information. &quot;Communications between Russian government officials and any individual with a security clearance have the potential to put our security at risk,&quot; Shaheen and Reed emphasized in their letter. The U.S.-Russia space rivalry has intensified since Russia&#x2019;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. Pentagon officials have condemned suspicious maneuvers by Russian satellites and accused Russia of working on a space-based nuclear weapon capable of disabling satellite networks. SpaceX&#x2019;s dominance in the U.S. space sector, with its Starlink network of almost 7,000 satellites, plays a critical role in U.S. military communications, including those of Ukraine&#x2019;s armed forces on the battlefield.	https://kyivindependent.com/democratic-senators-urge-investigation-into-musks-calls-with-russia-reuters-reports/	2024-11-15T14:58:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2023/09/GettyImages-1499013387.jpeg
4 Ukrainian children return home from Russian-occupied parts of Kherson Oblast	Four children returned home from Russian-occupied parts of Kherson Oblast, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Nov. 15. &quot;Thanks to the efforts of the charity organization &apos;Save Ukraine,&apos; the children are back,&quot; the governor reported via his official Telegram channel. &quot;They are safe and receiving the necessary medical and psychological help to recover from what they&apos;ve experienced under Russian occupation.&quot; Since the beginning of Russia&#x2019;s full-scale war against Ukraine, Moscow has abducted Ukrainian children from occupied territories and forcibly transferred them within the occupied territories or to Russia itself. According to the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s database, Russia has illegally abducted over 19,500 children since February 2022, and less than 390 have returned home thus far. In a statement released on Nov. 15, Prokrudin said the four children who returned home include four boys, aged between 1.7 and 17. Prokudin said that since the beginning of 2024, at least 229 children from occupied parts of Kherson Oblast have been returned home. Taking hostage people who take no active part in hostilities breaches the Geneva Conventions and constitutes a war crime. Around 1.5 million Ukrainian children who remain in occupied areas of Ukraine are at high risk of being deported to Russia, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said on Oct. 2. According to the Ombudsman&apos;s Office, those from children&apos;s homes in Kherson Oblast were first moved to the occupied territories and then deported to Russia.	https://kyivindependent.com/4-ukrainian-children-return-home-from-russian-occupied-parts-of-kherson-oblast/	2024-11-15T12:40:00-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/09/GettyImages-2030704636.jpg
Ukraine war latest: Scholz calls Putin, discusses war in Ukraine; Drone attack reported in Russia's Krasnodar region	Key developments on Nov. 15: Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke by phone on Nov. 15, their first direct call in nearly two years, according to a German government statement. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg reported that Putin and Scholz were scheduled to speak, though it did not specify the time or topics of discussion. The call, unannounced by either Moscow or Berlin, lasted about an hour, Reuters reported. The last phone call between Putin and Scholz occurred on Dec. 2, 2022. Scholz is the first head of government from a European Union country supporting Ukraine to resume direct contact with Putin. During the conversation, Scholz condemned Russia&apos;s war against Ukraine, calling on Putin to end it and withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. He also urged Russia to negotiate with Ukraine to achieve a &quot;just and lasting peace.&quot; &quot;Germany has unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,&quot; the German government&apos;s statement read. Zelensky warned later in the day that Scholz&apos;s call with Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls.&quot; Scholz had informed Zelensky in advance of his intention to call Putin. Zelensky reportedly responded, &quot;This will just make Putin feel that the isolation is decreasing,&quot; according to Suspilne, citing an undisclosed source in the Presidential Office. In his evening address, Zelensky criticized any negotiations that could ease Russia&apos;s isolation without meaningful outcomes. &quot;It is extremely important for Putin to loosen his isolation, Russia&apos;s isolation, and to conduct ordinary negotiations that will not result in anything &#x2014; as he has been doing for decades,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;This has allowed Russia to change nothing in its police, to do nothing in essence, and this is exactly what led to this war.&quot; Zelensky also reiterated that there would be no &quot;Minsk-3,&quot; referencing the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015, which proposed creating autonomous zones in Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but excluded mention of occupied Crimea. Ukraine&apos;s Foreign Ministry also expressed concerns over the Scholz-Putin call, stating that such lengthy conversations have been a tool Putin has exploited for over 20 years, now providing him hope for easing his international isolation. &quot;Even if the German chancellor did not express any positions contradicting Ukraine&#x2019;s stance, conversations with the Russian dictator do not add value in achieving a just peace,&quot; the ministry said in a statement. Germany, Ukraine&apos;s main European backer, is facing internal political turmoil. The center-left coalition led by Scholz has weakened, while opposition leader Friedrich Merz is eyeing the chancellorship. Both Scholz and Merz have pledged to maintain aid to Ukraine in line with current policies. However, an expert told The Kyiv Independent that the Trump administration&apos;s stance &quot;will have a much larger impact on Germany&apos;s policies than whether the next German chancellor is Friedrich Merz, Olaf Scholz, or any other likely candidate.&quot; Russia&apos;s Krasnodar region came under a &quot;massive drone attack&quot; overnight on Nov. 15, Governor Veniamin Kondratiev reported via his Telegram channel. One of the targeted districts hosts a military airfield. The governor said that two municipalities in the region were targeted, with Russian air defense intercepting approximately 36 drones over the Krymsk and Krasnoarmeisk districts. In Krymsk, debris from a drone fell on four residential properties, damaging the roof of one house and a car, according to Kondratiev. In the Krasnoarmeisk district, drone debris allegedly caused damage to the roof of a private house. No casualties were reported. The Russian telegram channel Astra cited local sources suggesting the drones may have been targeting the Krymsk military airfield. This claim has not been confirmed by official sources, and the governor has not commented on it. The Ukrainian military has not commented on the attack. Astra noted that earlier reports from local officials claimed 46 drones had been intercepted over the Krymsk area. Astra said that his statement was later removed without explanation. The Russian Defense Ministry later said that its forces had intercepted 51 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 36 over the Krasnodar region, 10 over the Azov Sea, three over Russian-occupied Crimea, and another two over the Belgorod region. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, Ukraine has turned to homemade drones to try to exhaust Russian combat capabilities as much as possible from afar, targeting Russian military-industrial complex facilities, airbases, or oil refineries. While Ukraine regularly claims attacks deep into Russia, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the reports and the scale of the damage inflicted. State Border Guard spokesperson Andrii Demchenko confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that a Russian sabotage group planted a Russian flag near the border in Ukraine&apos;s Chernihiv Oblast, but said that the event occurred in the grey zone and Russian troops did not launch a major offensive in the region. Demchenko&apos;s statement comes on Nov. 15 after Russian military bloggers posted videos purportedly showing Russian troops planting a flag on the bridge over the Sudost River near the border settlement of Hremiach and claimed they entered Hremiach and Muravi. Demchenko denied that Russian forces entered the settlements and said that they did not cross the bridge. &quot;The territory where the (Russian) sabotage group operated from the border is actually cut off by rivers, and no one lives in the settlements located between the rivers and the border. In addition, due to the constant flooding of that territory, it is not possible to build proper fortifications there,&quot; Demchenko said in a comment. &quot;Ukraine&apos;s defense forces fully control this axis and are in the most advantageous positions to hold the defense.&quot; Demchenko added that Ukraine has deployed additional forces in the area to fend off acts of sabotage from Russia. &quot;The threat from Russian sabotage and intelligence groups has not disappeared anywhere, in particular in Chernihiv Oblast. Although the activity of saboteurs has decreased significantly recently, the terrorist country has not given up on the use of sabotage groups, including for psychological influence.&quot; The Russian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) wrote on Nov. 15 that it had confirmed the geolocation of two Russian soldiers seen in footage shared by Russian military bloggers planting a flag on the bridge over the Sudost River. RFE/RL suggested the two soldiers were part of a larger group. Chernihiv Oblast is located on Ukraine&apos;s northern border with Russia and Belarus. It was partially occupied during Russia&apos;s initial offensive in February 2022, but the invading force retreated in April after the Kremlin failed to take Kyiv. Since then, Russian forces have been regularly shelling regional settlements near the border and launching cross-border raids into the region. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago event in Florida on Nov. 14 that his administration will focus on the Russia-Ukraine war. &quot;We&apos;re going to work very hard on Russia and Ukraine. It&apos;s gotta stop. Russia and Ukraine&#x2019;s gotta stop,&quot; Trump said at an event in Florida on Nov. 14, according to CNN. &quot;Whether they&#x2019;re soldiers or they&#x2019;re people sitting in towns, we&#x2019;re going to work it.&quot; Trump secured victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, adding further uncertainty for Ukraine regarding the future of Western military aid and its defense against the ongoing Russian full-scale invasion. Reacting to the election result, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Nov. 15 interview with Suspilne that the war &quot;will end faster&quot; under the policies of Trump&apos;s administration, set to take office in January 2025. &quot;A just peace is very important for us so that there is no feeling that we have lost the best for the sake of injustice imposed on you (Ukrainians). The war will end, but there is no exact date,&quot; Zelensky said. &quot;Certainly, with the policies of this team that will now lead the White House, the war will end faster. This is their approach, their promise to their society, and it is also very important to them.&quot; Zelensky noted that he and Trump had a &quot;constructive interaction,&quot; during which Ukraine presented its vision for peace. &quot;He (Trump) heard the basis on which we stand. I did not hear anything contrary to our position,&quot; Zelensky said. When asked whether Trump had demanded Kyiv negotiate with Moscow, Zelensky emphasized Ukraine&apos;s independence. &quot;During this war, both our people and I personally, in negotiations with the U.S. &#x2014; with Trump, Biden, and European leaders &#x2014; have shown that the rhetoric of &apos;Sit down and listen&apos; does not work with us,&quot; he said. Trump, during a campaign event on Oct. 14, claimed to have &quot;gotten along very well with (Vladimir) Putin&quot; during his first term (2017&#x2013;2021) and suggested that Putin had expressed ambitions to control Ukraine. &quot;It (Ukraine) was the apple of his eye; he used to talk about it. But I said, &apos;You&apos;re not going in,&apos; and he wasn&apos;t going in,&quot; Trump said. Following his electoral victory, Trump allegedly warned Putin in a phone call not to escalate the war, though the Kremlin later denied that such a call had occurred. U.S.-Russia relations have soured since Moscow&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, rendering Putin a persona non grata in much of the Western world. Ukrainian soldiers will receive additional financial rewards for completing combat missions in Russia, Taras Melnychuk, the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s representative in parliament, announced on Nov. 15. The update applies primarily to those currently involved in combat in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk in August, and while Russian forces have recaptured about half of the territory initially lost, fighting continues. The Cabinet of Ministers has amended two resolutions regarding payments to military personnel, extending the regulations to include troops serving on Russian territory, according to Melnychuk. Ukrainian military personnel operating in Russia during martial law will receive an additional monthly payment of 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400), proportional to the time spent on combat missions there. They will also receive a lump sum payment of 70,000 hryvnias ($1,700) for every 30 days of combat, cumulatively calculated. Soldiers and officers from the State Emergency Service, National Anti-Corruption Bureau&apos;s Special Operations Department, and police officers performing missions in Russia will also receive the 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400) bonus. Additional payments of 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400) will be made to soldiers wounded while on duty in Russia. In the event of death during a combat mission in Russia, the soldier&apos;s relatives will receive a one-time payment of 15 million hryvnias ($363,000). Ukrainian forces are currently holding off nearly 50,000 Russian troops in the Kursk area, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid-November. The Kursk incursion was designed to preempt a Russian plan to invade Sumy Oblast in order to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in Ukraine&apos;s north and draw Russian forces away from the steadily advancing front in Donetsk Oblast, the Ukrainian military reported. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have lost 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 wounded, and 717 captured over the three months of the Kursk offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-scholz-calls-putin-discusses-war-in-ukraine-drone-attack-reported-in-russias-krasnodar-region/	2024-11-15T12:13:22-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-1238504469.jpg
Scholz’s call with Putin risks opening a 'Pandora’s Box,' Zelensky warns	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz&apos;s call with Russian President Vladimir Putin opens a &quot;Pandora&apos;s box,&quot; potentially leading to &quot;other conversations and other calls,&quot; President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in his evening address on Nov. 15. Earlier today, Scholz spoke with Putin for the first time in nearly two years. The German chancellor condemned Russia&#x2019;s war in Ukraine, urged Putin to withdraw his troops, and discussed potential talks with Kyiv.

At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia held talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but the negotiations were eventually abandoned after Ukrainian retook the north of the country and mass war crimes were discovered in the liberated areas. In comments to Ukraine&apos;s Peace Summit in June this year, Zelensky said the Istanbul talks failed because of the Russian side&apos;s &quot;ultimatums.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/scholzs-call-with-putin-risks-opening-a-pandoras-box-zelensky-warns/	2024-11-15T10:59:47-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2176416230-1.jpg

War will 'end faster' under Trump administration, Zelensky says	The war &quot;will end faster&quot; under the policies of Donald Trump&#x2019;s administration, set to take office in January 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Nov. 15 interview with Suspilne.

What Putin hopes to achieve in Ukraine before Trump enters the White House	Donald Trump&apos;s entrance into the White House on Jan. 20 promises to offer a seismic shift in the U.S.&apos;s approach to Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and a potential &quot;freezing&quot; of the war. Trump has repeatedly pledged to end the war within &quot;24 hours,&quot; sparking fears he might push Ukraine toward painful territorial concessions to achieve a quick peace deal that could be favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although he hasn&apos;t provided any details about how he will achieve a swift peace deal, multiple media reports indicate his plan could entail freezing the war, suspending Ukraine&apos;s NATO accession, and establishing a demilitarized zone in the east of the country. A lot could change before the change in administrations, and both Ukraine and Russia will be seeking to enter any potential freezing of the front lines, and the negotiations that would follow in the strongest possible position. With a battlefield situation currently bending in Russia&#x2019;s favor, Moscow is likely hoping that recapturing territory from Ukrainian troops in its Kursk region, pushing further into eastern Ukraine, and opening a new axis in Zaporizhzhia Oblast could give it the upper hand before Trump takes office. One of the most pressing concerns for Putin will be the sizable number of Ukrainian troops still on Russian soil in Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Kursk Oblast in August, swiftly moving to capture around 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory. Russian forces have taken back about half since then and are moving to recapture the rest. &quot;From what I&apos;ve seen, there seems to be this belief that he&apos;s told his military, that they have to take Kursk (back) by the beginning of the year,&quot; Dr. Stephen Hall, lecturer in Russian and post-Soviet politics at the University of Bath, told the Kyiv Independent. And all the signs point towards this &#x2014; on Nov. 11, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian soldiers are holding off nearly 50,000 troops in the Kursk region, including a sizeable contingent of North Koreans. Fighting there will likely be fierce &#x2014; if Ukraine can hold on until Trump takes office, it could make the idea of Putin agreeing to any proposal to freeze the war unfeasible. Freezing the war with a front line inside Russia would likely be a non-starter for the Kremlin. &quot;Russia has amassed forces and will use the same tactics as in Donbas &#x2014; artillery and glide bombs to smash Ukrainian defenses, before small-scale infantry assaults,&quot; John Foreman, the U.K.&apos;s former defense attache in Moscow from 2019 to 2022, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;It&apos;s not pretty but it has been effective.&quot; Swedish-made Archer howitzer, operated by Ukrainian members of the 45th Artillery Brigade, fires toward Russian positions in Donetsk Oblast on Jan. 20, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey/AFP via Getty Images) #foroleksiiDonbasOne of the stated aims of the Kusrk incursion was to draw away Russian troops from Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine&#x2019;s eastern Donbas region, where they have been making grinding advances for months now. It didn&apos;t work. Over the autumn months since the incursion was launched, chunks of Ukrainian territory in the east have been lost. Russian forces have also made operationally significant gains near Toretsk, Chasiv Yar, and Kupiansk. It was reported on Nov. 1 that Russia had seized more territory over the course of one week than at any point in 2024. Russia&apos;s gains have come at an enormous cost &#x2014; according to figures released by Kyiv on Nov. 11, Moscow&apos;s forces suffered their deadliest day since the start of the full-scale invasion, losing 1,950 men over the preceding 24 hours. The figure surpassed the previous record of 1,770 set just the day before, and marks an ever-upward trend that is now months-long. Despite this, Russia at present appears to be able to sustain the losses, even if it is having to resort to ever-higher financial incentives in order to attract new recruits. But even at the current increased pace, it would take Russia almost a year to capture the additional 10,000 square kilometers (3,860 square miles) of territory required to capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Putin&apos;s stated goal of the war is the taking all of Donbas, so how this measures up with a frozen war without all of it under Russian control remains to be seen. According to Hall, even if Russian forces don&apos;t take all of Donbas, Putin will use the current strength of his army to &quot;dictate his terms.&quot; &quot;He believes that negotiations will be done from the position of weakness (on the Ukrainian side), that the West is weak, and therefore he will sit down because it&apos;s a way for him to dictate his terms,&quot; he said. &quot;Which will be the end of Western sanctions, it will be Ukrainian neutrality forever, and it will be facts on the ground, these are now Russian lands, and we want a pro-Russian government in Kyiv.&quot; &quot;Russia is making steady if slow progress forward, and may try and open a new axis of advance in Zaporizhzhia Oblast,&quot; Foreman says, adding it&apos;s another way the Kremlin could use territory gained to strengthen Moscow&apos;s negotiation position. Ukraine&apos;s military has already sounded the alarm, warning on Nov. 11 that Russian assaults in Zaporizhzhia Oblast could begin &quot;any day.&quot; Ukraine&apos;s military intelligence said Russia was planning to use armored vehicles and a significant number of drones, although it is not yet clear whether this will be a single offensive push or separate attacks.

Adding to the tension on the ground in cities like Kyiv, Russia has also in recent days launched simulated attacks &#x2014; launching large numbers of bombers and using electronic warfare to simulate launched missiles, prompting air raid alerts across the country. President Joe Biden has several options open to him, despite entering the lame-duck period between White House administrations traditionally seen as one of waning influence, increasing irrelevance, and menial administrative preparation for the successor. &quot;Key for Biden will now have to be spending down all the funds he committed to Ukraine in September and October,&quot; Steven Wolff, professor of International Security at the University of Birmingham, told the Kyiv Independent. &quot;He needs to ensure that happens before the new Congress takes power in early January.&quot; The Pentagon on Nov. 7 said it was committed to sending Ukraine the full outstanding $6 billion in outstanding military aid before Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. The aid includes a remaining $4 billion under the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which pulls weapons from U.S. stocks, and $2 billion from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said at a briefing on Nov. 7. When asked if the U.S. had enough weapons stockpiled to get shipments to Ukraine before Trump&apos;s inauguration, Singh said Washington was &quot;confident&quot; it could keep its commitments to Kyiv. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent last week, Ambassador Kurt Volker, who served as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in 2017-2019, said there was also discussion &quot;within the administration&quot; of finally approving the use of long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia.&quot; &quot;Something that the Biden administration has denied until now,&quot; he added. While Ukraine can already strike inside occupied areas of the country, this could have an effect on Russia&apos;s offensive in Kursk. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that if Ukraine had permission to use Western long-range weapons on Russian territory, it could preemptively target &quot;every camp&quot; in Russia where North Korean troops are stationed. &quot;We are now issuing a warning and believe that if political pressure and corresponding weapons are not applied to Russia, the next step could be a much larger deployment of North Korean forces,&quot; he said on Nov. 7. &quot;Putin always observes the world&#x2019;s reaction. In my view, the response so far has been insufficient.&quot;	https://kyivindependent.com/what-putin-hopes-to-achieve-in-ukraine-before-trump-enters-the-white-house/	2024-11-15T09:51:39-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2182768275.jpg
Ukrainian military fighting in Russia to receive additional financial rewards	Ukrainian soldiers will receive additional financial rewards for completing combat missions in Russia, Taras Melnychuk, the Ukrainian government&#x2019;s representative in parliament, announced on Nov. 15. The update applies primarily to those currently involved in combat in Russia&apos;s Kursk Oblast. Kyiv launched the surprise offensive into Kursk in August, and while Russian forces have recaptured about half of the territory initially lost, fighting continues. The Cabinet of Ministers has amended two resolutions regarding payments to military personnel, extending the regulations to include troops serving on Russian territory, according to Melnychuk. Ukrainian military personnel operating in Russia during martial law will receive an additional monthly payment of 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400), proportional to the time spent on combat missions there. They will also receive a lump sum payment of 70,000 hryvnias ($1,700) for every 30 days of combat, cumulatively calculated. Soldiers and officers from the State Emergency Service, National Anti-Corruption Bureau&apos;s Special Operations Department, and police officers performing missions in Russia will also receive the 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400) bonus. Additional payments of 100,000 hryvnias ($2,400) will be made to soldiers wounded while on duty in Russia. In the event of death during a combat mission in Russia, the soldier&apos;s relatives will receive a one-time payment of 15 million hryvnias ($363,000). Ukrainian forces are currently holding off nearly 50,000 Russian troops in the Kursk area, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid-November. The Kursk incursion was designed to preempt a Russian plan to invade Sumy Oblast in order to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in Ukraine&#x2019;s north and draw Russian forces away from the steadily advancing front in Donetsk Oblast, the Ukrainian military reported. According to Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Russian forces have lost 7,905 soldiers killed, 12,220 wounded, and 717 captured over the three months of the Kursk offensive.	https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-military-fighting-in-russia-to-receive-additional-financial-rewards/	2024-11-15T08:41:35-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/10/GettyImages-2166685846.jpg
At least 3 Russian oil refineries on verge of closure, Reuters reports	At least three Russian oil refineries have been forced to halt or scale back production due to significant losses and now face the risk of closure, Reuters reported on Nov. 15, citing five undisclosed sources. &quot;We expect that the actual (plant) closures may take place at the beginning of next year,&quot; one of the five sources said. The Russian fossil fuel industry is a key economic driver of Moscow&apos;s full-scale war against Ukraine. In response, Ukraine has targeted Russian oil production with long-range drone strikes. The Russian oil refining sector, hit by Ukrainian drones and Western sanctions, is now selling fuel at a discount and charging high interest rates. As a result, three plants &#x2014; Tuapse, Ilyich, and Novoshakhtinsk &#x2014; have either suspended or reduced production in recent months, according to Reuters. This crisis has led to a drop in fuel exports and lower revenues for companies, which in turn reduces state budget income amid high inflation and uncertainty in energy markets. According to Reuters, oil refiners posted record profits in 2021 and 2022, driven by a post-pandemic surge in travel demand and economic recovery. However, margins sharply declined as large refineries reentered the market and demand growth slowed, partly due to the gradual phase-out of fossil fuels. In this context, low-tech refineries have been hit hardest, suffering losses of up to 10,000 rubles ($102) per metric ton for several months in the second half of 2024, two sources told Reuters. State-owned Rosneft, Russia&apos;s oil giant, has been forced to suspend refining at its Tuapse plant on the Black Sea multiple times this year due to low profitability, sources said. The Ilyich and Novoshakhtinsk refineries in southern Russia have been operating at half capacity for several months, processing about 70,000 and 60,000 barrels per day, respectively, due to unprofitable conditions, four sources confirmed. All three refineries were struck by Ukrainian drones earlier this year, resulting in reduced refining volumes, according to sources. Russia&apos;s central bank raised interest rates to 21% from 19% last month, making it more difficult for many plants to survive. Another issue is the rising cost of oil, which in October traded at 50,000 rubles ($502) per ton on the domestic market, exceeding the required maximum price of 35,000 rubles ($351) per ton for independent refiners to turn a profit, Reuters reported, citing its sources.	https://kyivindependent.com/at-least-3-russian-refineries-on-verge-of-closure-reuters-reports/	2024-11-15T08:37:06-08:00	https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/02/GettyImages-1209343725--1-.jpg
